<p>This is not related to anything gay but i need advice ..</p>
<p>My Best Friend died when I was 11 .. I changed my school and then when I was 15 my Best Friend in this new school died too .. I changed my school this time the person whom I thought was my best friend was not actually my best friend I was simply in love with him .. Things didn't work out between us coz he was straight but ever since then I haven't had one friend who is like really close to me .. There were a few friends in college with whom I always hung out but deep down I didn't felt any love for them, there was no emotional connection between us for me they were just people I hung out with .. and now that the college has ended and I don't feel like talking to them anymore even when they want to .. I feel like I have become heartless .. I do wish it everyday that I find someone whom I can trust, love, share everything with but I am simply unable to find someone like that .. I mean there is not one person outside my family (they know) whom I trust enough to even come out to and I really really want to find a friend with whom I can share everything</p>
