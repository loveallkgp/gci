<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I need your advice.In college i have best friend.he is very handsome.i love him. I dont know whether he has such feeling with me. We sit together in almost every where. Some times both of play with fingers together, we remove footwear and play with foots together, in these situations ,i feel he is gay. He will put his hands over me sometimes while talking and play with fingers.i feel very comfort with him. Our another friend will some times say dont play like this,others will doubt you.we both move away when he say this. But he has many girl friends,he will try to make love with girls, he had lovers in past, these makes me to think whether he is gay or not. What is your opinion?

Once 4 months ago,he asked me &quot;are you touching and hugging me with such an aim&quot;? I smiled and nothing said, then he said dont tell to any one that i asked you this topic.

<h1>Viv- Jawani mein aise chakse saare laundo ko aate hain. There is a slight chance that he has inclination towards the gay side. And I think he is observing you and expecting you to make the first move. But at the same time be careful of your privacy, the blackmails, threats and emotional drama.</h1>
