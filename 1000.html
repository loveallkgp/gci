<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    frst to viv .. hats off
    moving on to confession
    its more of a personal diary sort of thing so is long n may b boring

    from the very beginning of my life I hv been girlie wore female atire etc. n even imagined myself being a princess n hving a hunk guard.
    then one day my elder cousin made me meet the sexual activities in the name of GAME
    though I enjoyed it (he nvr had an intercourse just intercrural sex)

    in school I was sissy geek intrivert bookworm
    was teased rather assaulted both emotionally n mentally
    had nothing like best frnd
    well even nt frnd

    this cintinued till I completed school
    I couldn&#39;t speak as neithr I had guts nor power

    days passed n I made this id
    starting with an attention seekr wanting vsome fame etc.
    I nvr mwt anyone in real
    then aftr an yr I did my frst tym
    n then I cant even count may b I hv done it 17 or so times by now
    had many relations n break ups
    got a lot of tags needless to say thy were nt good

    n then a question tht haunts me everyday ..
    will I b able to get a guy truly loving me n treat me atleast 10 prcent of the way I treat othrs
    n will b mine no mattr wat
    well my looks just make it nxt to impossibls

    bt prob remains I hv to marry a girl n b apart even if I found him

    I jist want a guy who is mine then leave this world of looking for sex etc.. friends are welcomed in my life

    n last thing to make mattrs worse my emotions tht just overflow like raim flooded wprld by great flood

    wat do i do ? stop jving dreams or stop caring much eithr way i need someone to hold me n make me the stringest by his mere presence

    thnx viv bro.
</pre></div>


<h1>Viv- Uhhhh quick question.. You will marry a girl if you don't get a boy? How will that be any good?</h1>
