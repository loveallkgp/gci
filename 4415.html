<p>my best friend whom i left is now claiming himself heterosexual purely. earlier in the beginning he considered himself bisexual/more homoromantic.
i dont understand why did he change colors so suddenly. i'm still in confusion how could he be heterosexual purely when he likes pick shirts . he even has he blanket of pink color. wears sometimes pink colored jeans.
Now he's claiming himself heterosexual.
He was the only person in my class whom i told all of my secrets my sexual orientation gay . my all of my little secrets which nobody knows.
now am shedding tears filled with great guilt feelings/regret why did i share my secrets with him. now who claims himself straight 100 %
. let me tell we never had sex except today just i touched his di*k.nothing else. i never did sex with him.
we used to hangout everywhere.I told him i lost interest in you. i dont know what to talk with you.
am feeling suicidal. nothing is left. i'm thinking of suicide by taking excessive sleeping pills.</p>
<h1>GCI- You are obviously kidding, right? Choice of color can never define you. If my choice of color is considered then I'd be straight, which I am not. Answer me one thing that you said that you lost interest in him and his supposed heterosexuality is driving you to suicide because you told him secrets? Am I missing something here or you didn't put some crucial cause?</h1>
