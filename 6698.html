<p>straight boys these days, cha ! </p>
<p>See admin I am 1000 times better than her in every thing ! 
I mean what do these straight men see in girls ? come on ! i would have been happy atleast if he has got married to someone better than me. I feel its unjust to see him married to a girl. I didnt know or my mind deliberately didnt want me to think the sharp difference between being gay and being a straight. all i knew was I am attracted to boys ( somewhere deep in my mind i know i am different from other boys and having sex with other boys, if known to others, is humiliated, but it is strange that my mind didnt want to think about it and sort it out, i somehow made up my mind to tink "love is divine, it may come on anyone, blah blah.. " ) Its nearly an year since the indian navy guy got married. I proposed him right at the face in broad day light in college corridor ( see my level of stupidity,without even a hint of knowing that "a boy loving other boy is humiliated", see the boldness in my stupidity !! ) He simply stood without speaking  anything, smiling at me. He might not have understood what does it even mean, poor boy. He is an angel fall on Earth ! oh man, you know how would he look in his blue and purple shirts ? Every single day i would see him without his knowledge and pass comments about his shirt ! He liked it ! He is rouge among his classmates ( my senior ) but such a great guy in heart ! those scenes still stay fresh in heart and comes alive when I am about to sleep, I mean I just cannot sleep without romancing with him virtually every night and almost every morning ! He was not known to have emotions on any girls, everybody said he is a kind of harsh to people, but he shed tears when leaving the college. With all my right i would take his purse and take money from it, such was the closeness ! I literally believed that ( oh see my stupidity, gosh, gosh !! ugh ) i will live with him. the girl he got married is... i dont want to comment on physical beauty but see why do angels like him fall for girls like her ? ( He is south, she is from UP ) i am far far better !!! I was the one who was loving him from the beginning, i feel its an injustice !.. admin.. its a sweet pain.. the point is now I dont find ANY MAN ANY MAN attractive, the daily emtions I have is now "meh!" "huh" :( I am emotionally flat now :( I need either him or nothing. I wanan go back in time and get him. i dont want any alternative solutions. just wanted to share this. it was sweet love story. &lt;3 </p>
