<p>hi all, i am a transsexual male. 23 yo i am in good clg. i feel very dfferent from other people, i feel left out even among friends. i feel like a women, but i am trapped in the body of a male. this is so hard for me. i have a feeling that others know my true identity, and so i force myself to behave more manly, do things a man is expected to do. but i can't find happiness in any of them, i am not strong inside so i cry myself to sleep every night. i am so confused. i don't think i will ever find a guy who will love me like a women, who will hold me when i am sad, who will cuddle when we will sleep. society will never except me, and for this i feel like i am nothing in this world, i am not wanted in this world. for what's the use of liviing a false life? also a life without love?
i am so pathetic, i feel like killing myself every moment of evry day, but can't muster the courage to do so.
i don't know anything anymore, what to do with this sad life i am living.</p>
<h1>GCI- What you can do is get in contact with other trans people who can help you in coming to term with yourself. I can never understand how difficult it can be to feel that you have a body that you don't belong in it, and it's a constant struggle every single moment of your life.</h1>
<p>You are in a good college, and you want to be a woman. Work hard to achieve your dream to be a woman.</p>
