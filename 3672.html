<p>Hi admin. Have written here few times before as well. I recently had a breakup. Have been trying to be strong, try to be busy but problme is that i just cant. I stay alone in hostel, no friends etc. Mere thought that my boy may be having sex with someone else, it just kills me. If I imagine someone kissing/touching/fucking him it just destroys me.. n i know that is happening or will happen as he himself told me he is looking for sex. What should I do? I always feel my guy is not bad, but why all this is happening to me. I m in extreme mental pain. Have been thinking of suicide but somehow i feel it will give him more pain. My mind has totally gone blank. I really dont want to live anymore. Kya karu :(
Please help.  </p>
<h1>GCI- You really have to accept the reality. Realization is the first step of cure. First of all, he is not your boy anymore. Second, he likes to have multiple sex partners and would even fuck a big ass dildo if needed be. You got to accept this as early as possible to feel good. You want someone who could have stayed true to you. He is not that way. So, in a way it is good that he has gone away from your life. Now keep your head high, your tits up and get that swag flowing.</h1>
