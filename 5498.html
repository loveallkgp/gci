<p>hii,gci well i talked about being lonely before with u but after somedays one of the guy frm my gay life revealed himself his true identity and told me about him.so,initially shocked as first time i came to know a guy ,and next i proceeded to know about his gay life.he tells that he has a lover and he left him soo,he wanted to sex with random guys to make him jealous.i did not know what kind of jealousy feeling he would get by doing such..and sometimes he tells that he want to commit suicide...iam drastically screwed upp.i know that guy frm last 4 yrs and i truely love as my brother and i asked that tell that guys name i will solve ur problm but he doesnt.rather than this i do have a good option other side a friend frm other college who is straight(hope so),smart and nice always loves mee i talk in bus when standing together touches him and he touches me wow chemistry works alot between us.he is very cute and i love him alot but stil where to go i have a friend to take care and other side my lover guy.</p>
<h1>GCI- How is that even a complicated situation? You love a straight guy which is never gonna happen. Be a friend to your gay friend. In the end you can just guide him, the decision to change or think with his brain has to be his own. But before you made him realize this, you think with your brain as well.</h1>
