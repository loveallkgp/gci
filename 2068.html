<p>my ex bf is like that bad ass type of guy and we are quite the opposite in behaviour, body structure as well as in looks, he use to get drunk like most of the time. Last month my ex and i had a fight He was drunk, i was so annoyed by his behaviour and since it was my first relationship without thinking deeply i leave him... :(
After our breakup he used to contact me but i use to avoid him
so what should i do???
i do love him :(</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, you do love him but can you be happy with him? Can you have a peace of mind when you are with him? If yes, only then you can think about being with him again. If it is toxic for the both of you then you really should think about other options.</h1>
