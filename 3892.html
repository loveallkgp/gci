<p>well..its basically a question...more to the Admin.
umm..why r most of the gays good looking?  Is it coz of the  attention they get from the other boys coz of being pretty OR is it coz they actually work on their looks to look pretty so that other guys can like 'em?
well...i personally don't consider myself good looking but everyone kinda says that and i even get hints n stares from some guys who actually are pretty...ok not all but most of them....woh baat alag hai that i or them never make a move :v afraid u know :) haan...toh the thing is it becomes really difficult to deny gals...i just dont know what to say them anymoreb...now i cant say ' i'm waiting for the someone special :) ' to everyone
 :(  ab toh speculate Bhi Karna shuru na karden. m not ready to out myself just yet....wait...where m i going with this :O actually i only wanted to ask that question....what do think why r most of good looking guys gay? 
P.S. comments mein dont anyone of u try to deny the statement that most of good looking guys r gay... coz its true :P</p>
