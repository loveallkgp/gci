I accept his 'I-Like-You' proposal and he said that he would plan our firdt date. I got a call later and he told me to come at his house, his parents are out of city. I was very much dissapointed, I thought he is a sex seeker but still I went to the given address and I decided that if he asks for sex than I would just break up with him but scenario turned out completely differently. He asked me to sit on chair and brought lots of delecious food on table and said that he prepared all this. His parents are out of city most of the times so he knows cooking and I was shocked when I ate that food (It was mostly indian cuisine- roti, chole, butter paneer etc.)...it was sooo tatsty...tastier than any other hotel. I teased him 'you brought this food from hotel, no!' but no he actually cooked it...Frankly speaking, My mom doesn't cook such delicious food. Than we sat in that mini garden and sat on jhula (that huge one on which 3-4 people sit...Btw what do we say it in english?) and we talked for 3 hours...I really liked that he really likes me , he was so much into me that he forgot to take out his kitchen apron...when he came out of his house to say 'see you soon', I pointed out and he wqs shocked that he didn't realise. While I was riding back to my home, I couldn't beleive that I've got a boyfriend who is quite good-looking, Manly and he can cook delicios food. we went on our second date today and it was at a coffee place which was agian planned by him and he told me that the coffee place is far away but it really serves best coffee in whole new delhi and I couldn't beleive that a coffee could taste this much better. Then we went to park and talked for hours and held my hand tightly while talking .
Now, I have taken the responsbility of planning our third date. Any suggestion where should we go? and please suggest that whether I should wait for our first kiss or I should take the lead and do it?
P.S. I am going to gym nowadays (started weeks ago) and focusing on bodybuilding :P</p>
