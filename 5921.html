<p>I am 26 yr old guy and this is my very recent
story of unexpected love making. I was staying at
my college friend's as we had a team project to
complete together. The battery on our laptop ran
off so my friend borrowed his younger brother's
laptop over the phone and asked me to fetch it
from the ground floor where his brother stays. He
handed over the laptop and later when I opened it,
I found that it was on hibernation and there was a
open browser with a page still there. It was a
facebook page with an open home page and it
didn't took me more than a sec to find out that it
was infact a fakebook, if you know what I mean.
I immediately had a hard on when I realized that
his ruggedly handsome brother of 23 yrs old is a
gay guy as well. 1000 thoughts came to my mind
but I kept myself calm and immediately pressed
ctrl + h to delete all the history. I just could't focus
all night. I knew his brother takes classes early in
the morning but I really wanted to contact him. So
I opened my faKebook, added him and sent him a
msg alongside.
I barely slept that night with thoughts of anxiety
because I had already imagined that we're gonna
have an affair. Early morning I checked my
messages and he had replied. I asked him what he
was doing that early and he said he had to take
some classes. I asked him if there is anyone cute
in his class and he expressed his sexual
frustration. He gave me a second hard on at that
time and I thought how perfect everything was and
that its all meant to be. I was really afraid to come
out to him but what the heck. So I boldly asked if
his door was locked from the inside. Confused, he
said ""what""? I rushed downstairs to his room and
knocked while still online. I knocked the door, very
very softly. He wrote, what the fuck? I wrote, I am
""Ram"", just open the door.
He opened the door after a complete minute
without writing anything. I sent him few messages
during that min telling everything from the previous
day and warned about his carelessness of leaving
the page like that. He did not reply at all but finally
opened the door. I locked it from the inside,
grabbed his chin and ravaged him with my kiss. I
pulled down his trousers ........rest we had mutual masturbation and then he left...Today we met for the fourth time after that incident
last week. We are crazy about each other. I now
believe in miracles but power of courage as well. </p>
<h1>GCI- Sorry honey had to edit..it was erotic but toooooooooo long!</h1>
<p>Miracle is not getting someone to fuck....but someone to love!</p>
