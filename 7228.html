<h1>GCI- Hmmm....very nice point.</h1>
<p>So, here goes.
1- Love is not dependent on religion but practicality is.
2- Religious issues are not to be dealt by neglecting them or taking them for granted.
3- Monotheistic and polytheistic faiths are two sides of the same coin and if anyone thinks otherwise, then remove them from ur life.
4- Religious doctrines are always in conflict because everyone thinks they know better then the other. RESULT- Communal riots and honour killings to name a few.
5- U cannot be equally intolerant and expect things to get smooth.
6- Until and unless all religions respect each other there will be no true peace in this world.
7- LOVE HAS NO RELIGION.....other than humanity.
8- U must respect someone's beliefs but must not allow anyone to dilute the strongest emotion of love on earth.
9- Intersectionality and humanity can only provide answers to our present plight as multi-diverse lgbt of our country.
10- Remember that this issue is a very broad one and cannot be answered in this single post and u will understand this in a couple of years.</p>
<p>P.S- What u did was stupid and what he did was also not ryt!
Both of u did a thing which had nothing to do with the bond u shared on a long term basis and him not feeling to go to temples was equal to u not wanting to understand that 'our' existence is the proof that religions DO NOT MATTER in loving someone.
The example of  Shahrukh khan and his wife Gauri is a fine testimony against this stupid religiosity. And spirituality when institutionlised becomes redundant and must be discarded.</p>
