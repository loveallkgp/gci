<p>Hi guys; i read almost every confession on this page every night and am very happy that admin is doing a great help for us-we indeed feel light if we share something which we cant share with anyone..Thanks admin..you doing wonderful</p>
<p>Since i havent shared anything yet to this page; i decided to right something here today..Its not a sex story so please dont read in any such expectations..But yes obviously woul like to hear your feedback if any:</p>
<p>Basically from kolkata; now settled down in chennai for Job..Well educated and decent..bit emotional..Am Bi sexual and age 24..As usual; sexual harassment happened with me when i was child (6 standard) which gradually made me what I am..wont say much proud about it..but not shy to accept being bi..When in kolkata; life was fine..caring parents and sibling..was brilliant in study..topped in all classes...completed three professional courses and placed in MNC with handsome salary...some straight friends were there.. One them was my crush...Handsome most boy in college--fair;slim;smart-a complete package..my good luck charm..i could have died in exchange of some nice moments to spend with him..My luck favored and spent a loving night with him..we did enjoyed (he is straight :P)..I was never hungry for sex..nor am now..anyways..i didnt happened for second time and i was fine with it..we still are best friend...and often talk to him on call (he is in kolkata)..i also mde some good friends through social networking...met with them..never for fun..although most of them met me in that aspiration..but i never mind their mentality..
1 year back..i came to chennai for new job..staying with colleagues in rented flat..get crush on one senior in office -4 level senior to me--age 37..I never thought of liking a person so elder to me..but when love happens i believe it break all your generic rules..Yes ! I loved him..I started staring at him unknowingly..and one day to my surprise..he approached me with a question-that why do i keep noticing him everywhere?--probably he caught me..I denied doing so..gradually he took me in confidence and one evening at his home i opened up..to mu great surprise...he said he is bi too...Gosh!! i didnt believed what i heard..Yes..he was bi..(i guess you must have heard that "kisi chiz ko agar shiddat se chao to puri kaynath tumhe usse milane me lag jati hai"..)now am spending most of my spare time with him..not for much fun but yes we do have enjoyed fun many times...Happy :)</p>
<p>So guys this si just to tell you that dont be despair for looking around for some one...If some one is in their your life-your destiny will conspire to make you meet him..I happened with me yaar and not once-but twice..but i agree that my love was true and unconditional..it was true and free of lust..jut have faith and trust..be patient..dont loose hope and never be heartless..</p>
<p>My wishes for all :)</p>
