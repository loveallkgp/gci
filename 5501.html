<p>Hi Guys
I have a strong crush on a guy in my office.Whenever he is nearby my eyes get glued to him.These things continued for 2 mnths,but he somehow came to know abt my feelings for him. He has started making fun of me in front of his teammates. So I stopped looking at him and even avoided him whenever i saw him.It has been more than 3 mnths i am doing the same,but he still ridicules in front of his friend whenever i am nearby.I really cant make it,why is he behaving this way and spoiling my reputation in office.Is starring at some body whom u get attracted such a big offense.I have never done any sexual advances towards him .Pls help me out i really feel uncomfortable in office because of his such behaviour. </p>
<h1>GCI- Do you have any anti-harassment laws in your company? I guess there should be. If they do, then complain directly to the seniors. He will face the consequences. Otherwise face him once and say, "Oh you looked good that's why I used to look at you. But ever since you opened your goddam mouth, whatever interest I had, it just went away. Do you know that you are a disgusting piece of shit? Have a happy time flushing yourself down the toilet cuz that's where you belong."</h1>
<p>One thing I have learned in my life that no one, no bloody one says an insulting thing to me and get away with it.</p>
