<p>So 6 months ago a guy was in total love with me. He was totally serious with me. But unfortunately I just was playing around with him and was sleeping around with other guys. Then one day he caught me red handed, obviously I was expecting to get verbally abused by him. But instead he didn't even utter a word. He just went away silently. As days passed I started missing him and I started realizing how perfect we both were together and I messed it up. I tried to reach him on phone it was switched off, tried to contact him on Facebook, he deleted his profile. Tried to visit his room only to find he doesn't live there anymore. Tried to ask his friends, and they said they don't know about his whereabouts. It seemed as if he never existed. It has been 6months now and I still miss him, he was so perfect! I don't even feel like dating anyone else other than him. And guys please don't ask me to move on and all those bull shit. I don't want to move on, I want to wait for him. I know he still loves me. He is just too disappointed that I cheated on him.
Rajiv I know you still check on me, if you are reading this you must have already known by now who I am. I know my mistakes are unforgivable, I won't even ask for forgiveness because I don't want you to forgive me! I want to live with this guilt forever But please don't be silent like this. Abuse me, hit me, scold me I won't mind but please come back. Give me a chance, no need to be my bf, just be my friend and I will prove it to you. Don't trust me but at least give a chance so that I can win it back!</p>
