<p>I am 25, a software developer located in Pune, I met this guy 27 on grindr. The event which I thought would be a one time thing turned out to be a series of hook ups and sleep overs. While I stay alone in my flat he stays with his family. There are often times when I spend hours watching him sleep. The best thing about him is the way he makes me laugh on every small thing, yes he is adorable and funny and cute and charming and everything I was looking for, except that he is bisexual and he has made it very clear that what we have is just a fling. I don't really wanna scare him by telling him how I really feel for him, but now an onsite opportunity knocking on my door step I will have to choose between what I want and what I feel. I will tell him so that I can make an informed decision hope I am doing the right thing. </p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm.... well, according to me u must see two main hard truths.</h1>
<p>1- He is bi and may have other plans.
2- U cannot control whom to fall in love with bt u can definitely control whom to fall out of love from.</p>
<p>Goodluck for ur life and stop being overtly romantic...it will take u nowhere unless u channelise it elsewhere in any artistic or satiating form.</p>
