<p>This more of REQUEST
To my every gay Fellow, Specially from gujrat. This Election time and there are high chances that BJP will become ruling party. And let me tell you one thing BJP HATES GAY community more than than they hate MUSLIM and we are very aware what had happened nearly a decade ago. On other hand we have congress which has made gay love illegal. Only safe option we have is AAP which has although not said that they support LGBT but are educated ppl and are open minded.
Just pray that AAP win and if BJP win ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BACK</p>
<h1>Viv- If my knowledge is correct, then congress hasn't made gay sex illegal. Its supreme court and its decision does not depend upon the coalition government. LGBT rights agenda is in their manifesto but it was expected because they are a lost cause this time. Still nothing can be expected. AAP's manifesto doesn't include our right's agenda but they do have a positive mindset for us. But BJP... ugh! Under Modi's rule all gunda parties like will be free to do whatever they want. I am a hindu and I am ashamed to say that if Modi comes to power then India will be Hindutva follower hetero dominated country. Nothing secular will be possible and especially gay people will be tormented beyond means.</h1>
