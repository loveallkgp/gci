<p>I am in relationship since the past 5 year. He is my first bf and he is really awesome. But for some reason even after five years I am still unable to trust him 100%. He is really caring and we have a strong bonding but there is always this fear that one day he might find someone better than me and will fall for him! I try my best but something still holds me back from trusting him. He always shares his sorrows and happiness with me. But I never share my problems with me, have this feeling what if he thinks me as a loser! Could it be that the breakup and cheating stories that has been hovering around in Facebook is affecting me? Many times I come across stories about people breaking up even after 7 years n cheating on one another. I try to convince myself to trust him completely but then again I will think that even after 5 years people leave so we are too no exception ! He knows I don't trust him and he really gets depressed about it! It's a long distance relationship and I in fact told him long back that if he want someone closure to him he can breakup with me as I can't give him his physical needs. But he is like "I have my hand, i can satisfy myself"</p>
