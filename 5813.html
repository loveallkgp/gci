<p>this page has become more of my best friend than just a simple page where I generally comment ... I find my home in here .. out of my loneliness I feel in my real life  and even in my fake gay life . I find peace in this page ..  few people comment thatni havenhad 35 boyfriends in my past and find me stupid and few say that I m too mentally mature to comment in here being just 20 years old ..  I just ask for peace at times . When I know happiness is not in my luck . I just don't ask for happiness even .. I just ask for peace .. I ask for silence .... ffffffeeeeewwwwww .... how hard is it to live ur life alone ... I just give a shit about people who find me stupid ... I just care about people who like me and care for me ..and except my parents I have no one . To even ever think about .... touchwood my professional life rocks ... but my personal life suck ...I wish I could change my luck ... if I were to reborn again ... </p>
<p>and thanks to u Admins .for  making this page ... I find my real home in here . I feel safe , I feel protected . I never feel alone . And I love sharing my secrets here .  Because I know u won't let me out to anyone ... I really like u ..  because .. I share like my 100 % of life here with u guys ... and that's what gives peace ... i have never seen u guys but I always pray and  wish that u guys never cry for love , u guys have it all and achieve it all u need ... seriously .. there are 10000 of people to hurt u and give u pain but people who gives u peace are those who are sent from heaven for u .. thanks and I feel like heaven sharing my scerets with u ... loads of love ..</p>
