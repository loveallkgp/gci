<p>Hello .. I saw the gay episode on MTV Webbed. Though It was a criminal offence committed by the boy , I somewhere felt sorry for the boy. :( leaving his sister part ,I would like to comment about his and his best friend relationship...He was confused about his sexuality and he was totally deprived of parental guide. He felt so close to his friend that he just took one step forward wid his best friend. I think it was not at all his mistake coz he got all love from his bestie.. The so called best friend should have understood his problem and counselled him about his identity . Why the hell did he drop his friendship ? The gay guy just felt intense towards him and was that intolerable mistake? Cant the best friend be open minded and try to understand d hell of the pain his friend was gng through? The gay guy felt sorry, ashamed, guilt and henceforth he approached his best friend to apologise .. But his best friend slapped him..how mean d best friends could be?.. I agree with d fact that there is difference between friendship and love.. But for gay people due to der lonely being and crave for love , dey do consider both friendship and love same and move ahead...so its der straight best friends duty to make them understand the difference between d two and need to support dem.. ..not leaving them in the middle of the journey... I felt the whole episode was against homos..coz seeing the episode I felt more disappointed and low.. now I am frightened to reach out to my best friends too.. my greatest fear is if i reveal my identity to my bestie and If he do the same thing to me as did in d episode, Wer d hell shall i go ?? :o Cmg to sister betrayal part I believe, In reality no gay in india will upload his siblings photo for his desires sake.. coz gays are more emotional and caring type den heteros.. totally the episode disturbed my mood and mind..:( # gay episodes should educate and lend moral support to the gay society and not the counter way :(</p>
<h1>GCI- Tell me the episode number? Or can anyone post the youtube link for it?</h1>
