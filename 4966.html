<p>Hello there,
How you all doing? This page was in the list recommendations suggested by facebook. So I checked it and read a lot of confessions. I really appreciate the admin and other people on this page who are helping others with advice. I wish someone could have done the same for me in my days. I am about 40 years old and in a healthy relationship for over 12 years. I was born in India and moved to UK in my late twenties. Life has not been easy, but I am glad I survived to stay happy.
I have read a lot of posts and most of you guys are as scared and worried as I was when I was about your age. Life is not always a bed of roses sometimes you have to bear the pain o thorns as well.
I would like to give a small advice to the person in confession 4927 about feeling his life is hollow. I met my partner in a gay bar that was mostly a call for hook up. We met there for the first time and have been together since then. I am Indian and he's of English-Irish descent. Our cultures are way too different but still we connect perfectly fine. His family was very accepting while mine , lets just say, not so welcoming. Sorry, got carried away there. My advice to you my friend is that some times most beautiful things comes from places you least expect them to be. So keep your mind open about and your dream man or soul mate will meet you. I wish you luck. And be patient. For filling that void, start doing something creative.
I wish you all find your soulmates and happiness.
Have good new year.
Regards
M. Singh </p>
<h1>GCI- I also wished that I had come across something like this when I was struggling.</h1>
<p>Have a happy life. God bless you both!</p>
