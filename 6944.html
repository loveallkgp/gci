<p>Hello everyone. I made all my courage and strength together to write here as it's my 1st post in any groups of Facebook. It was lack of courage to express bcoz I m feared to see the reactions, comments and perceptions on my thought's here. Instead of putting up post here I myself keep on assuming Wat wud be the admin reply? How others will take it? And so onn..... So here we go.... I m gay but act as bi. I m coward to come out and face society due to my family's political background. By God's grace parents blessings and self hardwork am financially sound enough. But my doubt which irritates me since my childhood is which was....if I can accept homosexuality. If I can accept gay relationships. If I can accept male 2 male attractions. Then why don't my brain is ready to see lesbians and transgenders in similar view. When It comes to trans I go very angry why these people's are included in gays category. Why don't these people setup their own category to nominate themselves. I have seen all over that lesbians and transgenders are always linked with gays together which makes shame of being gay. I m sincerely sorry and beg u to forgive me for thinking in SUCH way of my own in similar which I wrote here against L&amp;T. Request you to bring me in limelight and help me to understand the same in simple way.</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey first of all calm down and have a mug of beer.</h1>
<p>Now let me put is succinctly in points-
1- U r not afraid of others as I see, u r frightened of being in a family of political background.
2- U r brought up in a homophobic and regressive patriarchal set up, hence transphobia and a sense of disgust for lesbian sisters of ours.
3- U also have internalised hatred for the trans people because u r spoon fed those notions from the very beginning.
4- U are not able to see that how strong have u become in expressing your mind out even it is full of shitty notions against L&amp; T, divert this disliking and mould it into your personality thereby making yourself more strong headed.
5- U don't need to hate anyone for being in the rainbow because U R ALSO HATED for the very same reason by homophobes and pseudo-intellectual people for being A PART OF THE RAINBOW.
6- If u really know what rainbow literally means then u can also understand that the lights have a DIFFERENT wavelength and this is y its called a rainbow!
7- If u can try to understand about T &amp; L, then it would be the same for you to understand those who hate us.</p>
<p>P.S- We are all under the banner of the rainbow, have you ever thought y were we marginalised?! If yes then open your knots of ur brain urself, its YOUR JOB to do that not ours.</p>
