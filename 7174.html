<p>I have been meeting guys for a quickie since may last year,its just sex and no big deal just two guys doing it some of them were ok most of them aweful and every time i curse myself for not leaving sooner, when I am not in sync with the other guy .Today was my first threesome and needless to say it was the most BULLSHIT SEX(NOT EVEN SEX) i HAD EVER HAD. The good looking one was a jerk who left after he "came" and the bot was very disappointed because he really wanted to have sex.The jerk left and me and the other guy ended up sharing our experiences.He found my place dirty and i told him it was mine and it was none of his business (in a very non confrontational way).That guy was very genuine. We both had breakfast together and talking about relationships. He had three of them.He was very casual and outspoken about all his sexual encounters whereas I was a bit apprehensive about the whole sex thing mostly because its illegal and also he said that according to a study "our" minds worked like a criminal.THAT HURT.He kept on talking about being normal and the kind of guys he met .I spoke to him about my problems about my paranoia and stuff.I guess he found me elitist and egomaniac and later sent him a message that if he thought I was the jerk then he should never contact me.</p>
