<p>I am against Sushant Divgikar.., infact m a gr8 fan of his as he achieved wat i couldn't... He represented us .. But i always feel..one manly guy should have presented..n told society that even we hav got diversity.. N we R totally normal like dem. :(:(:( fuck dis life :(:( </p>
<h1>GCI- Oh honey you know what the problem is? The non-acceptance of the various behaviors is the major one within our community. It all starts from, "Who takes the stand for us?"</h1>
<p>If you look at the history, it was the girly guys who took the stand for the entire community in the Stonewall Riots, which were the start of LGBT liberation movement. Girly guys are the ones who had no fear of being themselves. They fear no judgments or opinions that are thrown to them even though people like you are the ones discriminating against them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the "masculine or manly" guys are always scared of the judgments, they are always scared of their behavior or anybody finding out. I am not saying that all are like that but the majority of them have that thinking. Over here many people start saying the same things like you did but no one has the courage in actual to go and start making a difference that you want.</p>
<p>As far as the term being normal is considered, who says that the manly behavior is normal and the girly behavior is not? The majority or the expected behavior can never make a behavior normal. To me hate is abnormal and what you are thinking is abnormal. Try thinking with an open mind and know that haters are the always the ones who are hated by the majority of the people. </p>
<p>Grow some sense anyway. You desperately need it.</p>
