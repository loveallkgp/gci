<p>Sorry to do it this way. This is not a confession. I am trying to find someone whom I found on this page. Some days back I posted a confession about troubles in my 8 year long relationship. And he gave me the best advice to work on it. 
I wanted to tell him that I'm following what he advised in the chat. And I'm seeing positive results in my relationship. But since past 2 days his account is showing deactivated. Don't know where I should find him.
Nikhil, I don't know where I should find you. You are the only genuine person I found here and I don't want to lose such a valuable friend. Your words always motivate me to work on my relationship as you always said during our chats that every small thing grows when it is nurtured with care and love is no exception to this. Please get in touch with me Nikhil if you read this. I really miss you.</p>
