<p>My name is Vikram Sharma. The first name is fake and so is this Facebook account I'm writing from.
I've always been vested in all of this, being gay, being vocal about my sexuality and interacting(trying and failing) with others like me. 
I wanted to be something and eventually do something for people like me. But recent events make me feel so small. 
By recent events, I mean the earthquake in the region. I'm from the northeast and I'm Nepalese-Indian. So I sympathise with both the communities. The earthquake was scary, felt a devastating one here a few years back and a similar one today too. It makes me feel that our problems are so small. 
When I was home alone and everything was shaking, I did not care if I was gay or straight. I did not care if my parents would ever accept my sexuality, I just knew I loved my parents and wanted them to be safe at their workplace. I did not wonder if my brother, my friends, cousins, relatives, neighbours or anyone for that matter would be okay with my sexuality. I just wanted everyone to be safe. I've had my differences with people, but I wished all of them safety. In that moment, nothing mattered except the basic sense of concern for another living being.<br>
Whom I get turned on by or what gender I get attracted to is a small part of my identity. In the moment of helplessness, it did not matter. 
I always opposed Modi and his government but all their decisions and steps to help my Gorkhali brothers and sisters in Nepal and my brothers and sisters at home, in India silenced my opposition. I did not care that the Modi cabinet wasn't very liberal. I did not care if it was homophobic. In that moment it did not matter. Nothing did. I was safe but I was sacred. The pictures on the news invoked something in me. I do not pray, so I just wished for their safety. </p>
<p>Nature has its own ways of showing us how little we and our problems are. What I mean is, many confessions here don't mean anything. To think of what we read here daily, it's so trivial, it's so little. It does not matter whom you sleep with. It's a tiny part of your identity. You as a person are so much more. I was even glad to see  Baba Ramdev alive(as he was in Kathmandu at that time). Il didn't matter what views a person holds, unless they've done some great evil, we shouldn't wish them dead. </p>
<p>So, in that moment, the budding gay/human rights activist in me wanted to help everybody. I reached to my relatives and acquaintances in Nepal as well as here at home in India and I was glad they were all safe. 
I was saddened by the deaths of all of those who lost their lives. I don't believe  in an after life but a small part of me wanted to believe that they are all at a better place. </p>
<p>So, let us all stop this little indifferences that we have towards others. Learn to forgive and to apologise. Realise your flaws and improvise. 
 Help others as often as you can. Life is short, spend it with little negativity. Those who do believe, pray for the departed souls. And pray for all who have survived. Wish no evil on anyone and try to put a smile on other people's faces and your as often as you can.</p>
<h1>GCI- Never keep grudges for anyone even if they are not sorry because who knows that would be the last when u see or meet them!!</h1>
<p>And i agree but remember one thing natural calamities strike oftenly when there is an overload pandemonium for the nature to handle it...Similarly when humanity takes a backseat ..REVOLUTION OCCURS JUST AS APOCALYPSES WARNS!</p>
<p>P.S- I m above all hate and favouritism..hope u understand this now!
