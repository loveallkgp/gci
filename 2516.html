<p>Hey admin.. I found this argument regarding lgbt rights on da UN human rights video dat u hd posted yday.. I found his arguments almost unbeatable. :((( How come they stopped at LGBT, how about polygamysts, incestuous couples and zoophiles? Shouldn't they also be given rights and be accepted by society. If you accept gays then you must accept others too.What part of CONSENTING ADULTS principle your prejudiced and bigotted mind cannot understand??? What do you have against two adults having consensual sex? Even if they are a mother and a son or a sister and a brother. Just because your Bible stigmatizes incest or you are prejudeced against it does not mean we have to deny the happiness of two consenting adults. You are a prejudeced hater. Do you know that? With regards to zoophilia. Who said that consent is important? We slaughter animals by millions everyday for our food, keep them in seclusion in zoos for our entertainment, and do testing on them for our health....nobody even thinks to ask for their consent. But when it comes to sex, consent all of a sudden becomes important. This is hypocrisy. I DID NOT associate gays with zoophiles or incestophile. They are NOT the same. All I am saying that once the society accepts gays then it should accept other sexual minorities because same CONSENTING ADULTS principle also works for consening and adult siblings and poligamists. Heteros also feel disgusted at the thought of two guys kissing or having sex to each other but it did not stop western societies from accepting gays. Then how come we should keep rejecting other sexual minorities if you happened to be disgusted at the thought of screwing your brother or a bull screwing you. Just be honest....consenting adults are there but you still cannot accept it because you're prejudiced against incest. (#sarcasm alert ) It might have to do with your religion or it might have to do with you moral standing....but you need to realize that these are the things of the past and we are living in the 21 centure. So stop being a bigot and a prejudeced hater. Get over yourself and your disgust....because nowadays nobody gives a f===ck about what people feel disgusted about....it's all about human rights, liberties and democrasy. Let's not speak about child abuse because I am talking about adults only. **
1) What if the incest is between same sex siblings or between a father and a son? Is this type of relationship OK with you because obviously they cannot have children? 
2) What if the opposite sex incestuous couples do not want to have children or agree to adopt them? In that case would it be OK? 
3) Should people with illnesses that can be passed from parents to children (heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer) also be banned from marrying because there is a chance that thier children can have the same type of illness?</p>
<h1>GCI- Only two points for you.</h1>
<p>1) No one can stop people from going incest. It already exists. As far as hetero incest is considered, they already have their rights by the constitution. They don't have to fight against the law for their survival. If homosexual incest is considered then again the law plays a major role in the person's survival. And trust me, the homo incest never look for domestic partnership. They always prefer to find someone outside the family. </p>
<p>2) Zoophilia is something that in which you cannot obtain a consent. You can only do that if you can speak animal language. So it is out of the question.</p>
<p>In the end, fondle pussies and stroke cocks as long as they belong to the humans who give their consent and on the other side they are animals. Spread love and not confusion.</p>
