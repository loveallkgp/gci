<p>hi..im 23, patna. when i was 13 or 14, i was quite a shy guy. some of my relatives used to make fun of me. they used to tease me..pass coments like - "girls should be shy..guys shouldnt be...you act like a girl. something is wrong with you.....you have a smooth face..." one of them (my cousin uncle) sexually abused me one day. it went on for few more times over next few months. now this all things are a distant past for me. i did my engineering..now doing my masters. im no longer a shy person. infact, im of the student who speaks most in the class and participates most in the extra curicular activites. also im a straight looking gay guy. no one can even guess by my looks that i m a gay. but still they had much demoralised me during that age that even today when i go their home and visit them.. i still cant properly talk to them. i still feel shy with them. and when i visit that cousin uncle , i just go blank. of course, he would have forgot all those past things. ..but when i meet him..sit on the chair..then i just dont know wat to talk with him. i can talk to the whole world but not with them. i think this is what happens if somethings bad happens to us when we are quite young.</p>
<h1>GCI- It's a good thing that you have overcome your introvert nature when it comes to public platform. I am sorry that you had to go through child abuse. That uncle of yours is a criminal anyway. You don't have to feel compelled for talking to him. It wouldn't really matter if you do. If someone asks, just tell them the truth. You have to be bold anyway. Last thing, behaving like a straight guy is not a trophy winning thing or something to feel proud of. Just be yourself and don't hide behind the veil.</h1>
