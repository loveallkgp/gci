<h1>GCI- Its a great thing that you protected yourself from abuse. Most of the child abuse cases happen within the family. To other who went through the same in their childhood, if this thing had happened with you, its not your fault. It does leave a black memory in your head but it was never your fault. It is however possible to come out of it. You just have to be strong enough.</h1>
