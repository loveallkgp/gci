<p>Seasons greeting to evryone... and a warm hug to d admin.</p>
<p>M 19. Proudly i am a gay and My physical behaviour is masculine. </p>
<p>This is about my best frnd.I love him like hell. I hav an extreme crush on him. He doesnt know anything about my orientation. He's a perfect son, perfect best frnd and a perfect boyfrnd material. Once i was talking to him about LGBT rights. I cud realise he was highly irritated. He loves me alot but hates LGBT community frm d core. my complex is now coming into my behaviour due to dis. The love thing is fading. He has started realising d change. I cant explain him anything. And i am confused too. Wat to do?</p>
<h1>GCI- He is entitled to his own opinion, but as a friend you can always reach to the core of his hatred. Maybe he himself is homosexual but detests that part of him and is putting up a face. Maybe he is ignorant. Or maybe he was abused and that's why he hates the gays. You have to understand that there is a cause behind every behavior.</h1>
<p>I'd suggest to not give up so soon. If he comes around they good, otherwise, leave his thoughts in peace.</p>
