<p>Well, here is my confession. I am a lad of 25 years hailing for the capital of our country. I was in a relationship with a guy for 1 year. We both stayed at different end of the city but still we managed to take time out for ourselves and we both had keys to each other's apartment. Thing began to go murky when I got to know that he is being fooling around with someone else behind my back. I didn't immediately believe it but I got some proofs that were more than enough. I can't act like a heartbroken guy, rather I'd beak him apart. So when he was out for his job I took leave and went to his apartment and pick up all of his clothes and distributed among the poor and changed my location from there. A real good lesson for that bitch. Haters gonna hate but I loved what I did.</p>
