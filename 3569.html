<p>Hello i admin Bit long but direct from heart I met a guy on fb and were in relationship from past many months than we met at public places too. So many times he said i love u and meant or acted to mean like that. He always made me feel like his sm1 special and many times treated like that too. After meeting him i have deactivated and deleted my fake or others accounts on other gay social networking sites too. Few days back he started behaving like m stranger to him And when i asked, he told me that all he was doing was just a fun and sort of timepass...Whereas i have given him a special place in my heart.....Whenever he was sad i was there for him and when i said i m sad he simply ignored it completely. Now i cant even hate him.Cant even forget him bcoz my heart does not allow that. Saara din uske khayalo mein rehta hun,na study mein man lgta, bhookh khtm, na neend na chain even uske dhyan mein pooja krte krte haath bhi jal gya. Aur wo apni life mein mast hai. Main kya kru...kuch samjh nhi aa rha.(Itna pakka hai k main usko kisi bhi halat mein hurt nhi kr sakta)Usko bhool bhi nhi sakta. I know he is reading this post. please come back. ro ro k mere aansu bhi khtm ho chale hain ab to...........</p>
<h1>GCI- Why do people do like this? Hey fake love guy! You know a thing called karma? It always bites back.</h1>
<p>To you confessor, do not expect him to turn up just because of this confession. It would be better if you accept it and not give a fuck to some rude ass guy who left you in the middle of nowhere. If he had cared for your tears, he wouldn't have left. So stop begging him and be a better person than that guy who has a lowly life. I am rude, I know but some people really deserve the hard truth in their faces.</p>
