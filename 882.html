<p>How to socialize with my class mates?
I mean, there are some problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of them are part of some group or other.</li>
<li>I find people so different from myself (Maybe i take my sexuality very seriously) that i don't understand WHAT TO TALK to them! I just don't understand how to start or continue the conversation without making it boring.</li>
<li>I also fear that since , as i said in point 1, most of them are already a part of some friend circle, would i be INTERFERING to them if i try to be friendly with them. Will it feel that i am trying to be over-friendly?</li>
</ol>
<p>4TH. HOW TO MAKE THE INTERACTION NOT JUST A FORMAL-FAKE INTERACTION but a "real" conversation without making it uncomfortable or irritating to the other person.</p>
<p>Admin and friends, i know u ppl may write LONG advice for this, so just put in relevant points for each problem.
:) :<em> :</em> in advance.</p>
<h1>Viv- Since when starting a conversation is something to be thought about so intensely? You just have to go with the conversation. Flow with it. Just talk what you like with them. Sit with the people you desire and talk with them about the classwork and other stuff of college on daily basis. Simple as that. You do not necessarily have to bring in your sexuality in everything. Go easy and stop thinking so much because its not that big of a problem you know.</h1>
