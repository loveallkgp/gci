<p>I wanna confess something about this gay world That everyone overhere is just looking for sex and good faces only ... Yaa seriously There's no humanity No normal behaviour Nothing at all I try to make a group of some gay peoples (chat group I mean) almost all of them are not sex seeker (I think they are not) everything is going on well but every one has their own ego and I don't know what reason, they don't wanna be a part of virtual freindship I think either I was wrong that they are just cute simple guys or there's no unity in homosexuals... that's y most of the people who wanna live life with their life partners (I mean who prefer gay marriages) are still trying to make this happen... For winning any sort of battle there's a need of strength which comes from unity and selflessness (because if we are selfless then only we can be devoted) But what I come across all this years of experience (although whatever I had :-P) is that only one night stand and hang out and physical charm is important for most of the people... So I am just wondering then y people here pretends to be so good and y so much drama of being good and saints like behaviour as if only interested in quality not charm of body... To fool the simple ones or just for their fantasies :-P :-o :-/</p>
<h1>GCI- Well I wanted to talk on this for a long time...u see</h1>
<p>1- Unity is different on the personal level and the political level.
2- Its not mandatory to be friends with all the lgbts...a mere acquaintance is enough....bcoz the vibes of friendship has an innate frequency coming from within..forced friendship is mere negotiation.
3- U may be united for the GREATER GOOD or the BIGGER CAUSE but at the personal level we all have different wave lengths to match.
4- For e.g- Me and my ex went to the pride but never saw each other during the pride walk last year...its as plain as that!
5- U may be knowing many lgbt people but u cant be friends with all of them..its impossible..just the way strt people are..sexuality..etc has no role to play in friendship...
6- Every guy has a definite persona and it is not at all possible to match each and everyone's mindset.
7- Once u understand that Friendship cannot be done on the basis of sexual orientation..u will understand that there is nothing to whine about!
P.S- ITS A VERY NICE POINT U PUT IT OUT HERE....IT WAS REALLY NECESSARY!</p>
<p>G BLESS SWEETY!</p>
