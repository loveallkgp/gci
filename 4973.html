<p>Hey guys....Satsriakal admin,</p>
<p>Today I was reading the newspaper when my elder brother suddenly popped up the question of masculine actor and asked of my favourite actor....I replied Siddharth malhotra to which he said he is so manly what about ur Manliness?? I started smiling and he was bewildered by my expression and answer; I counter questioned him what exactly is masculanity??? He was silent and couldn't answer properly...I asked him again.. Is violence, dominance, suppression of others masculanity???..to which he was again silent...that made me remember an incident where I was once going with my friend to his place...suddenly out of nowhere a man in his thirties started mocking and abusing us and called us faggots and used ill language...he seemed drunk...I didn't get scared or afraid rather called him a lunatic at his face...my friend went altogether nervous by his fake threats...he said a thing which echoed in my mind again..I CAN FUCK A WOMAN ..I AM A MAN....I now know that this statement is so invalid now for any man...
In my hometown I was believed to be a whore because I am gay...but one fine day I answered a boy that to fuck me u would have to get fucked first....to which he was shocked, surprised, frightened and ashamed at the idea....
My brother asked me as to whom I idolise....and my answer was ME...I idolise myself....thats not being narcissistic but yes I truly dont idolise anybody...My life cannot be compared to great men..they had their stories of struggle...I will have mine...I get strength and inspiration though from them but I feel stupid to compare their lives with mine....I had read somewhere that be on that position in life where ur idols become ur rivals...(a very heavy statement indeed)
He wanted to know it to mock me because I am not manly enough according to him...but I was not at all baffled and answered him...Masculanity depends on how u lived ur life as a HUman and not by what MASCULINE deeds u did...SO next time if anyone says u r effiminate u know what to do...And yes I am not feminine but I love it when I am with my gay friends....I dont feel bound to act like a MAN all the time...I am gay doesn't mean I will conform to the norms set by patriarchy...OUR VERY EXISTENCE IS THE ANSWER TO THE BLINDING BINDING NORMS ITSELF....</p>
<p>GODBLESS AND STRENGTH TO U ALL..</p>
