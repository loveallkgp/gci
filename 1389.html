<p>Firstly i appreciate and congratulate admins for der sensible advices :)
This is not a confession.I have a strong point to share wid u all. We,d Indian Gay people are deprived of many things. And i believe dis is d tym for us to get united to mark our existence in dis society. But if u guys closely observe , d main hurdle for gay community is we, ourselves only. I say this because if u see on fb, major percent gays on FB are here only to fulfil der sex desires. This is wat tat makes d main stream society to think about gay people as only ' sex seekers' :( . All my FB friends , please be a genuine fighter for gay rights. Stop posting words like " I am top , Bottom, Anybody free?, I hav place, wanna suck ...blah blah.." Stop uploading ur nude pics on fb coz u are not here to market ur private parts. These are just bullshits .Sex is only a part of life , but shockingly many gays on fb are portraying gay community in such a way tat for gays- sex is only der life. :( Dis is d real misery of our community. God has made us special coz he wanted us to spread d value of human relations .He wanted us to show to dis world tat love happens between two divine souls and not between two genders. I believe even we , gay society has some ethical values. We gay people shuld uphold our purity ,our ethical values , our morality. We shuld show d world tat we are far and more better human beings den heterosexuals. We shuld show dem tat ' Love, sex aur dokha' happens only in der world and not in our beautiful world. Gays are d purest form of humans. I hereby request all my gay souls to be united, supportive, and matured so tat our voices are heard and in near future our existence is appreciated and blessed. Proud to be GAY. </p>
<h1>Viv- Marvelous thought, but here's a snag. Its not only gays who go for sex seeking. It happens in heteros too. That's why there are brothels, that's why there are pages on facebook, that's why there are prostitutes. The things about us is that we get sex very easily and that puts us in the negative light because its OH SO TABOO. What I despise, is that guys who have the guts to get naked infront of a total stranger, cannot even come out in full clothes to speak about their rights because the society won't allow it. And I simply hate this excuse with passion. Everyone has sex and I don't know why it is such a big deal but rights should matter to each gay person because getting our rights means we can live with dignity.</h1>
