<p>In my batch, there are two feminine guys. There's even one lesbian who is open about her sexuality. But the story is about these two guys, the Guy A is quite talented and he has made the use of scarce opportunities available in our college and displayed his talent to many people. He is so popular, I don't want to mention what talent he is because he might be a follower of this page, so it's better to maintain confidentiality. This guy A is so popular among boys and girls of our college and he is open about his sexuality. Then there's guy B who is still under the closet, he is not so talented or handsome and people tend to make fun of him, verbally bully him sometimes. It's just the way he speaks is quiet feminine, the guy A even applied kajal sometimes and no one talks anything rubbish about him.</p>
<p>This is the case of selective discrimination which exists in our college. Even though our department is supportive of LGBT, I can't understand why people are selective prejudiced to some gays. </p>
<p>I too was quiet feminine during the school days and I did receive lot of criticism from my family members. Plus, bullying from the students of my class. I had to restrict my behavior, force myself to behave in a certain manner and repress my internal tendencies. I do that today as well and I can say for sure that it's not easy, it just harms you psychologically. Some tendencies can be inborn in nature and they never go, no matter how much environmental restrictions you put on yourself.</p>
<p>It's not only the guy B who faces discrimination, I'm sure same is the case with other feminine guys of our college.</p>
<p>I will soon meet the Deputy Dean Student Welfare of our college and will submit a proposal to establish a centre in our college to support LGBT, Muslims and other minority groups which might face harassment in our campus. I will even ask her to give the permission for conducting a LGBT pride parade within the college premises.</p>
<p>I don't think she'll agree on all matters after all her superiors are conservative but at least we can try.</p>
<h1>GCI- Until and unless women stop treating themselves inferior and feminine gays stop holding the victim card and gay guys stop whining about their sexuality nothing is gonna change much. And for ur efforts kudos to u for  such impeccable thinking.</h1>
<p>Also I would say that lgbt are the same like straight community-fat,thin, tall, long short, dark, beautiful, ugly....don't make assumptions that lgbt is all white asses with fairies behind them as guardian angels.
For ur classmates they are acting according to the personality traits they have build up in them. U build up urs accordingly and live it as it should be lived. U live only once so make sure u LIVE every day!</p>
