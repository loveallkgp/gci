<p>how many of you get irritated when your mother says 'abhi toh iski shadi karvani hai, achi padki doondni hai' 'mein toh apnee bahu ka intizaar kar rahi hun'? i get extremely irritated, i have told my mom to stop this marriage talks and frankly speaking, i have shouted on her at such a high pitch that it could be easily by every neighbour, so you know my mom has stopped doing so because she doesn't want to experience my horrible reaction... i sometimes wonder why our parents, without any doubt, jump on a conclusion that we are straights, don't they think or doubt that their soon could be a gay ? </p>
<h1>GCI- We can't blame them because they have been brought up in that kind of scenario only. They don't have awareness of any other kind of possibility.I'm not settled and I'm just 23. But my mom has started saying the same things and I have to tone her down from these marriage talks. Nevertheless, truth can be told whenever the time is right.</h1>
