<p>I want to say "Thank You". Yes, Thank You for showing how low level you can be. Thank You for showing your mentality. Thank You for showing that even though you live in a good area, your brain is living in a bad area (you). Thank You for showing that even if there are some people who help others to get their rights, there are A-holes like you who are afraid that LGBT is a contagious disease. First of all, LGBT is not a disease, it is a person's gender identity. What would you do if your child grew up to be one of us? Would you keep him/her caged for the rest of his/her life? Or kill you child? Because that's what people like you only can do. It would be better if you watch one of these videos:</p>
