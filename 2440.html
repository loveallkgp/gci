<h1>Ash, 19</h1>
<p>Last night, was watching. There was a breaking news from middle India.
A 6 year old boy was sexually abused by his 'Own Father'.
The man used to stay naked in the house. His wife used to oppose his behavior, and was always beaten up.
One day she went to police station, and asked to file an FIR against his husband.
Friends you know what police said!!
SHO Said,"Madam America jese bade desho me to ye normal si baat h, or ye aapke ghar ka mamla h, hum khuch nahi kar sakte".</p>
<p>I was Shocked, I mean what the hell going in India.
when a news channel broad casted it, then authorities took an action against it.</p>
<p>Even here on this Confession page, people are asking about, how to seduce his own teacher.
Other want to sell his kidney for money because because he is fed up of sex.</p>
<p>Ek bhai or h usko partner nahi mil raha to usko suicide karna h.</p>
<p>Logo ko 2 din me pyaar ho jata or third day, they ask,"he is having sex with others, is he loyal?"
-Rather than asking such questions to us why people don ask this to themselves.</p>
<p>abhi khuch dino pehle ki hi baat h, Ek Idiot ne apne loyal lover ko slap maar dia. Because kisi sardar friend ne uske lover ko propose kar dia. Isme Boyfriend ki kya galti.</p>
<p>when people will start to use an important organ, called BRAIN</p>
<p>This is what happening here.
means gay life sirf counted points par hi ulajh k reh gai h.
Is situation me kese Defeat karenge #377 ko.</p>
<h1>GCI- Oooohhh.. frustration at its peak! The first thing that you mentioned is really stupid. The ground level government workers can be really lethargic at times. Most of the times they don't have the heart to work. Its pathetic. And yes, people make mistakes. Grave mistakes. All are not blessed with a power of realization and usually suffer through harsh realities to get aware. And don't even start me on relationships. If I go there, many people will feel offended. So keep it at that only. Valid points are these, but its just a general scenario of the negative side.</h1>
