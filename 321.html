<p>$$$ADMIN_ABBY : it's okay honey see.. if you feel that you are a woman trapped in male body then you shall go ' sex change ' . but first of all make your mind and just think it deeply that this is your decision and that you are not doing it because of social pressure or any other circumstances . rest thing is you have to talk to your parents about it too .</p>
<p>also i want to add it is difficult process and takes long time . you just don't go to doctor and after a week change into a woman . as you are 19 , its when your male hormones are at peak and it will be difficult process...  but its all about your will ...  may god give you enough strength .. my best wishes :)</p>
