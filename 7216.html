<p>I am a 23 bottom. Two week back I met a guy through PR. We met for tea and he was nice and handsome and wanted LTR just like me. But there are two problems. He is quite old around 34 and I am just 23. Also he lives alone unmarried and so I asked him many times for sex . but he says he wants to wait till we know each other better and blah blah. Admin pls tell me should I get involved with such guy. I can compromise on the old age but such attitude treating me like garbage. I think there is some problem with his dick. So he is single at this age and doesn't want sex with me also. It has been more than two weeks since we met.</p>
<h1>GCI- What is wrong with the next gay generation here???</h1>
<p>If somebody wanna have sex early then they are horn dogs and perverts and if somebody takes some required time to gel then someone is impotent.....
I m done with this hypocrisy honestly....</p>
<p>Listen kid....its just been 2 bloody weeks and some people 
don't get laid for some time...heard of DEMISEXUALITY ?????</p>
<p>P.S- Its the ryt thing to not get laid not very early in being a potential romantic interest of someone and if u r going for a relationship then its mandatory to abstain  for atleast 3 months
( official crush period psychologically).
U may be ryt...he may have some issues, so y r u whining about it here...get laid with some other dude or bloke...is that a herculean  task?</p>
<p>N.B- What the fuck is LTR...Is it LDR ????</p>
