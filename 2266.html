<p>I know this is a gay confession page but the higher thinkers among you can do with a bit of insightful thinking... so here it goes!
There's something creepy about cows. They've got the blankest face of any animal. A dog pulls expressions. A cat bares its teeth. What does a cow do? It just looks at you. It doesn't even stare, because staring implies some kind of effort on the cow's behalf. A cow just stands there with its dumb face angled in your direction. Its huge eyes somehow combine approachability with a terrifying lack of any discernible sentient feeling whatsoever.
Cows are ultimately unknowable. If you fell in love with a cow, the lack of emotional feedback would slowly drive you mad. You'd never know whether your feelings were reciprocated. You'd know if the cow thought it was going to rain, because it'd lie down. But you'd never know if its heart skipped a beat when you whispered its name. That is the tragedy of human-cow romances. That and the locals beating you to death with hoes.</p>

<h1>GCI- I always thought those were donkeys. Cows are quite useful you see. They give you milk from which you get your cheesy pizzas. BTW... just being concerned.. choose a human next time, and a good one for that matter. :)</h1>
