<p>Hi i m Niyaz 
I m 25 
Few days ago i met with a mature guy in mumbai while i was in bombay for my company works . It was my first visit to bombay so i was very curious nd extremely nervous about new city and new peoples.....
Although i met a guy by the reference of my another friend ...we met over coffee he was excited and said that m his choice and more or less he was my choice since i was not aware about his nature so i didnt say anything about wether i like him or not ...
But we were started out meetings ,every morning he used to come to my hotel and we used to go to morning walks and we had sex too ...i started liking him as by looks he already  has been in my zone 
But later on when i knw about his nature more i inclined towards him ...
Its 9th days in mumbai and we have met all the days except today morning. When i got incline toward him i was start msging that i like him and i love him but he never responded ...i knw i did wrong by saying such words as he never said anything about relationship things so i thought he is open for such things and i met anybody after 2 and half years so i couldn't control my emotions.
Yesterday we met he was saying about his preference and what he expects from others he told me he is very open he cant commit he dont want to be in boundation .
In his place he is absolutely right but i got hurt my self by my own expectation its most disheartening thing .
Last night he was msging me on whatsapp but i told him that i m not interested and i dnt want to meet him anymore.he didnt ask me the reason but what does it matter ..
Matter is i was not able to sleep for single second tonight 
Was thinking about him was looking for his msg. But nothing hppnd 
I dnt knw it will be in my favour 
Or against it ...but these experiences making me tough and adamant to trust peoples ...thought he is very loyal about his needs but its me who have exoected what he cant give </p>
