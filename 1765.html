<p>Things happen in life, they are being forgotten sooner or later. I finally have forgotten everything, everthing that was sad, everthing that made me feel low, everything I was afraid of, everything that wasn't good for me....
But still, it's too empty not because I don't have a bf (though I don't need one) or friends; it just feels that way. There is always a solution to every problem, I too found one after experimenting a lot. I already had friends so i thought may be a bf could work out but it didn't, I tried sex, but it felt so wrong afterwards, studies, i tried them but couldn't focus, I couldn't sing coz my home, it's just too crowded as they get disturbed, can't listen music coz I sing along loudly.. Then finally I found a solution, Reading fb statuses, it just makes my day a way too shorter then when I don't use fb. But it's temperory. I don't know what I'm after, what I'm doing or what I'm gonna do.. I just wanna go far away, where there is no one. Where there is just me, a tree, a blue sky, and clouds that hides the sun and lyrics and my voicebox....
Someone take me there..
I'll be ur slave for lifetime.. Please.. :(</p>
<h1>Viv- Yes indeed you do need a vacation away from everything. But don't be a slave. Be a fucking king!</h1>
