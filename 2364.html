<p>So here is my confesion.......
as i am a virgin age 24 nobody knows this.......
i have a ugly body it kills me my self confidence my self respect my self love .....
my body has Stretch marks
they are on my biceps area ,on my knees ,on my full butt area,on my calves,and now they started to appear on my stomach so it makes me utterly ugly and unattractive i don't think that any guy would ever like to touch my body .....
in addition to dat i am an average looking guy i don't have a pretty face or smile at the height of 5,4" i don't think i am attractive at all .....
because of this i never have the courage to date i feel so insecure i am afraid of getting rejected because of my looks .....okay chalo man liya dat guy shows interest in me and everything goes well but when he try to get intimate wid me and see the hideous marks on my body which totally turns him off and it leads to an awkward break up.......
i feel suicidal every time i don't think i can survive lifetime loneliness.
---age 24,gay,male</p>
<h1>GCI- Why can't you feel contended that you have air to breathe, fully functional body, a roof to live under and education to support you? There are too many things that could lift our spirits up that we humans neglect if we get one sad  thing to take us down. External beauty is everything in the world always. Even the most beau Also, you don't have to be dependent upon a person to feel happy or to feel loved. Learn to love yourself the way you are and feel satisfied with your body. You are a lot better and lucky to be healthy and whole.</h1>
