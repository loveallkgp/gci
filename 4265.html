<h1>GCI- Honey, you gots to get out and start living your life. Having self pity and cribbing in your room is not gonna do anything good. Don't you get frustrated by this kind of an attitude. I have been in the most terrible situations in my life and breakup wasn't among them. Either way in my depression period I got angry on myself that why the hell I am being this way? I had to get over it. Until and unless you make an effort for it and try to be happy, no one can help you even if you ask here.</h1>
