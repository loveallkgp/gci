<p>Hey its ma confession frm bindaas boy.....
I come to know bout homosexuality in ma
hostel lyf... My junior introduced it to me....
Later on I was away frm all those stuffs nd
started living straight life (not 100%). With
time one guy entered in ma lyf nd v did
everything. V lived every single moment of
life vry joyfully nd I was in love with him,
but he cheated me. Our relationship was for
three years. But after breakup I came to
mumbai nd I another guy entered in ma lyf,
he is very hot nd I was magnetised towards
him nd he also attracted towards me. So at
first meet v kissed each other nd then our love
story began.. But I come to know bout him
dat he had sex with 200 boys., nd I gotta
shocked, but still 2 I accepted him... But,
two months ago v had a quarrel with each
other coz of whatsapp, the reason was , he
was always online but he nvr used to txt me...
So v had a big quarrel nd he said m not
perfect nd blocked me....
But as I was in deep love I always kept
txting him, nd one day he gave me reply....
Now the main thing is dat, he is doing d same
thing again nd again, he is not replying me nd
his behaviour have been changed....
So I wanna to know dat shall I continue
with him by accepting him as he is or shall I
leave him.....????
M very confused....</p>
<h1>GCI : when somebody a gay guy specially finds a true lover .. he happen delete all his id's on dating and sexing sites ...grindr, pr , fb any .... but if he is player he won't do that . so get this thing that a guy is worth your relationship. don't play fool..and stay away from gamers.</h1>
<p>i don't get it how you guys get fooled so easily ... i mean you people will  buy lappy ,mobile or something else you will serch and interogate everything ..but when it comes to a guy where does your researsh work go .and don't get physical untill you believe that person completely ( to all the guys ) . so that even if break up happens it won't heart much and you won't feel used . </p>
<p>and i don't think that guy you met later in mumbai likes you . just for his need he had committed a fake relationship . that's all.</p>
