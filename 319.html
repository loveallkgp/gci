<p>Beloved admin plz post it...Hi friends,there is nothing much new in my confession but still wanna confess,thing is I have a huge crush on my best friend. i am 20 years old guy. i am doing mbbs. i started to love my best friend who was my schoolmate  till 10th std.  In school...first  we both were enemy  as we both were toppers, so i had jealous on him ,though i never allowed him to took 1st rank instead of that he took my heart...when we moved to district place to study  2 science,luckily i got him as a roommate. we used to sleep on one bed as he broke his own one. i used  to hugg him ,cuddle and kiss him on his chicks while sleeping.though he never refused but never did such things with me also. we did fights also. once i throwed a small fish pot  to him while fighting. but our friendship never broke. after completing  2 he joined engineering and me medical... we both are in different cities now...THE PROBLEM IS he is straight... Though i never told him about my feelings for him openly,he knows that i love him,&amp;i think he guessed that i am a gay. I love him,what feeling i have for him is definately not a lust....though he is straight ,i am something special for him ,i guessed this from his behaviour...he never resisted me to hugg,kuddle him,so am bit confused. in middle years i was suffering from depression that time he supported me a lot..i love him madly. i want him.am i thinking in wrong way or wt?i dont know what to do but i need him. wt should i have to do? plz suggest friends..thanks. forgive if i am mistaken while writting this confession or  while loving him..:thanks  plz post it admin    </p>
<h1>Viv- Dear buddy, it seems like he is an understanding guy. And you should tell him about your feelings. You have so much burden inside you that it is tearing you up from inside. Somehow or the other get it our. Tell him to not take it in a wrong sense. If he agrees then its all good. If he is straight then you have to move on no matter what. You have to accept the hard truth.</h1>
