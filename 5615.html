<p>Hi,
Since I was a kid, I had this fantasy of marriage, a house 2 kids and a pet, kind of like Indianised version of American Dream. I loved my fantasy so much that a lot many times I pictured myself taking the Holy Rounds of matrimony. It changed over the time from a bride by my side to a groom. But that fantasy always stayed. I read this story on Sunday
http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/21/my-boyfriend-killed-himself-because-his-family-couldnt-accept-that-he-was-gay
It broke me inside. I am torn apart between two worlds. One with my family that includes a girl and the other with a boy without my parents. My story is very similar to this unfortunate couple. If and when that time comes, God knows what I will do. Maybe my fate would be the same as that of Naz's.
I never wished to be gay but still I am. And my parents are very rigid about the society norms. My dad is ex-military person and in no way he is going to accept me. I seek is their love and acceptance. But considering everything it seems like impossible.
I wish a day could come and we the LGBTQ can be accpted by our very own families without giving a damn to the socity norms.
-Amen</p>
<h1>GCI- I read this story too. It was depressing.</h1>
