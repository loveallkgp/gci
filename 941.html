<h1>Viv- Oh god please! It is said that the best of friends can make best of partners. 6 years is a big time and you can make it beautiful as you know he won't leave you and you won't leave him. And if you are considering the look factor that you are superior in it then you won't have any lover to last for the lifetime. So stop being selfish and give him back a little in return for all the good he has done to you.</h1>
