<p>Gay M 25, I am sick and tired of my voice. it's very feminine. i am tired of explaining the people on call that it's sir and not ma'am. guys on the phone talk to me in a flirtatious way and girls talk to me in ego. some make fun, some imitate, some give dangerous ideas of becoming a backstage female singer (as they feel that i sound similar to indian singer alisha chinai). i visited the ENT (Ear, Nose &amp; Throat) doctor in april and suggested me an exercise which i followed diligently but nothing changed as an alternative he suggested a surgery for which i will have to go to mumbai but it is a very risky one as i can even lose my voice forever or it may become more inappropriate. i hate myself for it. i am tired of people laughing at me everytime. i really don't have any confidence left to speak up in public although i like to socialize and take part in vocal competitions but i pull myself back for the fear that everyone will judge me and laugh at me. very confused as to what should i do.

<h1>GCI- Or the other thing you can do is to own it. For some people the paths to lead the life is laid down. All they have to do is walk on it. For some people, they have to dig up their paths, pull out the roots and pebbles, make the path worth walking and then walk on it.</h1>
<p>If you keep on thinking about what other people might think, you will get nowhere. Honestly, think about yourself first.</p>
