<p>hello everyone,</p>
<p>I just wanted to know "Are sad attacks common?"</p>
<p>I am 22 yrs. pursuing my B.Tech. from a reputed college. Currently I am in final year. At the end of first year I had a HUGE crush on my best friend. But somehow I got myself under control (paid a huge price though :P ). Now its just sometimes I feel very lonely. It happens once in a while like after 2-3 months. It last for 2-3 days. During this period I sleep all the time, no classes, no mess, keep myself locked in my room. But after two three days, its like nothing happened.
I have a family history of mental illness also. So I am kind of scared.
Please Help!!
Thank You</p>
<p>Love you #Admin :P</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe you are going through the condition called being Bipolar syndrome. I said maybe. Your emotions have highest of highs and lowest of lows conditions. Is it like that?</h1>
