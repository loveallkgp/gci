<p>Hello , dear friends and my haters. I am Arijit Biswas. First of all I would like to clear that I am not in the admin panel of this page. Coming to the point that I comment shit, you must tell me where. Even if I do so , did I force you to follow my advice? If you like it follow it and if you are not sure then do whatever you want. If you really don't like any of my comments ignore or block me or go for one to one counselling, this is a public page and I will continue commenting as long as the admin don't block me from the page. To the people who thinks that the new admin is bitchy and comments shit. What you expect when you post shitty confessions, calligraphy typing skills, bitchy stuff.... a round of applause ? What about the closeted gay or bisexual guys who bully feminine guys and confess it here, guys who play with others emotions, closeted guys who believe in gay rights but thinks that effeminate guys are a shame on their community. What do they deserve 'bravery awards'? Gay guys who are financially independent still marry a girl and blame it on parents, did their parents tied them and made them to marry a girl? If you are that much obliged to your parents then why did you had sex with guys? Did they asked you to have intercourse with guys? What should we do with those guys who say that they can have sex with guys and girls still they are in relation and give an excuse that they are bisexual? What do you expect the admin to do with them? Sympathise ? What about the guys who would never struggle or come out but want LGBT rights? How should the admin treat the guys with no spine and double standards? I feel the admin is very humble in many cases where the confessors needs a kick in ass! Spineless, coward and double standard people often use the word 'Bitch' for independent, empowered and strong people ?</p>
