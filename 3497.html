<p>Hello people, I have completed 152 days here that is around 4 months 30 days. I had a past experience that I wanted to get over start a new. I always knew I have been manipulating life and have manipulated because of my insecurities and fear and losing my loved ones. Time has come, I have realized it's not my space. I was exploring my sexuality which I did and I m more certain about something. I had hookups as well. All I wanted is to relive those moments which I have spent with someone, someone special. I forgot the reality that I can't get the similar person, similar situation, and yes similar emotion. He is no more with me, no grudges about it. He's happy that's my priority. Up here I met so many people, many I approached, many approached me and so on. But that connect was with hardly few. After all, it was fake. The fake people were so fake they even wanted to exploit me, but it's part of day. As said without winter, spring can't come. I accepted it. The guys forced me at times, but my principles, value has always given me power and it give me then to with stand it. It was my choice. In all this I met someone from the real circle of my life. There were so many north-east guys. I respect you, I appreciate you, but here only few made me feel the reality in real. They were so cool that I found the connect. A friend was so special what to say he's still in contact, we flirt so much, I doubt on my own self because of it, how can I flirt so much.I t was sweet and sour. Love you all, bless you all. I m deactivating my account tomorrow. I know it's like some social drama, but what to do decisions are drama to many. Miss you guys, you all taught me so much. I now, know what are the ground realities. I will miss you perverts too, you kept the fun quotient to the optimum. Take care, live life to the fullest. P.S. ignore typo error and focus on the emotions.</p>
