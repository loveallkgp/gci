<p>so i was in a realtion with this guy for a month. Although i am year older to him, He is my first bf. but he had 2 bf earlier, first a foreigner who went back to his country and second one perhaps a rondom guy because he was going through hard parting with a videshi guy. we met 2 months ago. Things click instantly, i love him so much, he loves me too. Last month he went to his hometown, we still talk and text everyday. But from last week his phone was off. and he didnt reply on fb also. i dont know what went wrong. should i go to his hometown. I am holding the gift he gave me at the station before he left and i am crying</p>
<h1>Viv- Just be optimistic and pray that everything turns out well.</h1>
