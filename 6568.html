<p>Two of my classmates themselves came into my life.Made me their friend and created room for me to include me in their life.
One of them is my boyfriend.Another one used to get jealousy seeing me with my boyfriend.
I dated my bf for 1 year .
Later to defend his image my bf stopped talking to me cuz there had been lots of speculations.
Now the another one who has a girlfriend , does defends his image.
I know he s a closeted gay.
He started teasing me faggot. I laughed because it doesn't affect me at all. But as soon as I tease him he can't tolerate. He stopped talking to me.
Lol
Now none of them talk to me.</p>
