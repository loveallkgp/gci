<h1>GCI : see i don't have any potion to make people fall in love or fall out of love . but i can surely tell you what will happen in next feew years .</h1>
<p>first two years from now will be very hard on you . you will feel broken and rejected . you will often listen to bad songs and your fb will be filled with your anonymous sad breakup which never happened . then in 3rd year you might try to move on . you will start searching for gay pals ,  but as in heart you still love that guy from school your relations won't work as you will not find them attractive . 
again sadness will come ... though anyhow you will now decide taht your are gonna forget him .  but occasionally you will be stalking him on facebook . all day all night .now he will be posting pictures with random girls or girlfriends from college which will make you think " oh god he is committed ' , .. why !!! but you will then anyhow give yourself hope and say nah he hasn't changed his relationship status . you will get happy 
you will for few months stay away from fb and get busy in you education and college fests . and when you get back on fb you again start stalking him .... ' wow he is  getting even more handsome ' u will think . and now a girl is commenting on his every picture and liking it too. and he never replies her comment but likes it ( which means something is really cooking between two of them '. now you stalk that girl profile religiously and finds out your crush has liked her many pics . now you get sad . ' he is gone ' you think ... like this  3rd year is over .</p>
<p>in the 4th year .. you a re single gay .. trying to find out good gays for relation but can't find anyone . .. and though your love for your crush is almost over but you still have likeness for him and you will be still stalking him on fb to get his glimpse . tio see how he is doing</p>
<p>( <em>_</em>  takes  tissue papers to sweep off his tears )</p>
