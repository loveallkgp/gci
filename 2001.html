<h1>Ash 19,</h1>
<p>"Love is very powerful"
Its since 10 months I have joined this place. I only say truth and love to be true.
I joined just for sex seek, to meet new people for sex and fun "only".
After creating this account, same day Raj accepted my request and he entered my life. That was the moment which changed my life forever.
Because it is such a place where my leg could have slipped and I would be a sex slave or something worst.
After it sex was not remained important for me. I am was not sex maniac and even not now, but its even morally wrong to meet people only for sex and leave after done.
I have spent my joyful and precious moments. Being on this social website, I Met lots of people of different people, with different minds and different point of view. I managed myself at accurate time and age, and I thank my Lord for this.
Many people came, used me and threw me, its painful but I manage, I miss all those my early friends those are not now with me. I learnt to handle people, I learnt the tactics to manage in all good or bad situation. My journey is amazing and lesson to me. I learn from every single day which gives me the confidence to go ahead.
I know its boring but its me. :)</p>
