<p>i have to confess something of great importance. Today my mom sprayed hits all over the house and being a germocidal it killed all mosquitos :<code>( when i was taking a nap this afternoon a baby mosquito came near my ears humming and i was all mushy hearing his voice and I felt so sad for him. We seprated him from his family and now he is alone I think we commited a cardindl sin :</code>( I instantly fell in love with him and he also gave me a kiss on lips leaving a big swollen hicky. Now I want to give him the family he lost. I love him a lost. But there is dilemma in my mind does he loves me? Would be there any complications in sex? Can mosquito have maids (a refrence for mosquiotal aids)?. Would he forgime for killing his family? will my parents accept me for who I love? It's urgent please reply. PS: love u #viv and #abby, care to join me for a double date with my mosquito </p>
<h1>Viv- My my I'm gonna bring my own mosquito on the date. I'm gonna start a revolution to legalize mosquito love. Even for mosquito adoption! You sir, have opened my eyes. :'(</h1>
