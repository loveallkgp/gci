<p>ok, let's play a game.. what have you done or what limits have you stretched yourself o be with the person you are deeply in love with. Let me begin first. I work in a lab at IIT and i am absolutely smitten by a lab assisstant. he is bred well, very decent, knowledgeable about technical stuff and helpful. Everytime he sees students doing things that might harm them, he comes over to help. (Sad coz i thought he does it only for me). so i try to go to his lab as often as possible with the stupidest of doubts and while he works, i keep on staring at him. he has caught me a few times staring but i don't think he read too much into it. So this is me, Rahul Vasishtha.... you guys and gals too.. put in your kiddish activities that will make you lush and smile at the same time </p>
<h1>GCI- Well there are too many to count. But i'm not saying about the "naughty" things. Just the general happy times that I spent with my friends in school and college. Damn! Those were good times... :(</h1>
