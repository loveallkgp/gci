<p>Hello....Admin First of ol a big thnks to u fr this page i alwayz read d confessions nd ur suggestn to dere prblm too....nd i nvr thought k i will be also confessing one day in diz page so nt taking uR enough tym m starrtng my cnfession</p>
<p>I m 19 years old guy frm Guwahati ,Assam nd yes i m a gay bt diz gay wRld had also hurted me a lot. As evry1 needs a truemate fr him i was also searchng fr a guy who could make me feel special </p>
<p>Evrytym wen i opened my gay accnt i wished k today i will meet my love but it took a vry long tym nd dere i got a msg frm a guy ov my race we started chhtng nd yes i did fall in love wth him but i was faR frm d truth k m jzt a tissue paper fr him. Tym passed,we had sex nd aftr dat he dumped me nd he said k he nvr loved me nd he iz a playboy. This incident left me tottally heaRt broken nd Fr diz reAson i deactivated my Account</p>
<p>After few mnth ov diz incidnt i goT request from my school Teacher who left school us wen we r in class 6 nd nw m in bsc 1sem.After chhating i Found dat he iz gay nd on the other Hand he iz marrieD too nd blessed wth a child nd i was like Wtf...nw he used to call me nd asked me fr sex but i akwayz give excuses coz i can't do it as he iz maRried i can't cheat hiz wife nd his son.</p>
<p>P.S-My question Frm d admin iz dat wat should i do nw should i do sex wth him or not???? I will be waiting fr uR valuable suggestion thank you</p>
<h1>GCI : first of all as you said you want partner then why even ask me if you should have sex with your teacher or not ??? i mean that question shall not even arrive at first place.</h1>
<p>there is 6 months dating rule .only after 6 months have sex with a guy . if a guy seriously want you he will wait for 6 months but a playboy won't.</p>
