<p>ok... this might be a little complicated and lengthy so readers expected to give theirs valuable opinion wisely.
lets divide this into two parts,
this is the first part, as follows:
= now the thing is, i m in an open relationship with a guy. its a LDR. we both are from same state hardly 20kms from my place.. but  he works in dubai... its almost a year now. n we ver going so well.
this is my second relationship. n he has been into few relationships b4, which didn work coz he felt that they wer too possessive abt him...so now till january i was not possessive abt him as we are in a LDR so its very much understandable that evn our body needs has to be satisfied, so we both gave each others a permission of having physical relationships with other guys when we are far,..
he has come down to my town(his town as well) two times for almost 15-15 days each times he arrived. and at that time i was in cloud 9 as every day we use to roam n hang around everywhere. kisses, fun romance... wooow!!!!!!!!!!!!!
now the second part:
 In january 2015 i happen to meet a guy here. a localite. n we both  came so close to each other that he tend to develop feels for me and i also cudnt resist meeting him everyday.. so the friendship took a new turn n it became much more then just frndship.
 {my frnd is top too}.
 one fine night after the party me n my frnd wer so drunk that stuff happened between us. i tried penetrating him.. and he kind of liked it so much that after that he always wanted me to continue doing it to him. now my bf dont know that i had sexual relationships with my frnd. he came down few days back n i askd him weather if i have sex with my this frnd wud you mind it, to which he replied that he will have no problem if i do so,.</p>
<p>now that very day when my bf came down he happn to meet  this frnd  of mine, they exchanged numbers and started chatting with each other, initially i didn had any problem if they do so but this was getting worse n worse everyday... back in feburary i cud easily take my frnd's phone and do watever i want, like reading his personal msgs or opening his fb acc. he never had any problems with it, but now he dont allow me to read any of his msgs, n he deletes the conversation on watspp which he chatted with my bf. now my bf treats his as his second bf n even he does it. they say that this is a love triangle. they even said that we all 3 will settle down abroad n live togther. they hold hands, kiss on hands, hug infront of me.. but they never lip kissed infront of me.now i m feeling very insecure kind of coz of all this nonsence n dramas happening around my eyes.. in a way i cant even tel them not to do all this, as it  might jus hurt them or they might feel that i m doubting upon them.</p>
<p>day b4 yesterday i asked my bf weather he was serious abt having sex with my frnd, to which he replied that he is.. as he considers my frnd as his second bf. the same thing i askd my frnd n he consoled by saying that he will never do it as he dont wanna break my trust. bu i doubt they might jus do it behind my back yaar... 
another thing is that my guy is flying this month back to dubai n in next monnth even my frnd is planning to go there as his dad lives there. now if they both go to dubai then its pretty much sure that something will happn..... i m so dead...</p>
<p>i m crying since last 3days.. silently.... dunno wat to do,,,, dont want to lose any one of them... dont wanna end my relationshio nor wanna risk my frndship... 
admin pleeeeeeeeeeeeassssssssssssse help me yaar,,..
guys please help me..
 wud be really thankfull to you all.. please....</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, let me be blunt over here. I don't understand the whole concept of open relationship. Some people may have this arrangement but I just can't wrap my head around it. I mean you are in a relation with others and when you have sex outside the relation, you are bound to feel for the person whom you are having sex with, unless you are just a sex machine and and NSA is your motto. I can be wrong in this.</h1>
<p>The main thing is that you had an arrangement in this whole scenario, why should you feel bothered about it? You can have sex with someone else but why can't your bf? It all happened infront of your eyes that's why you are crying. What is the guarantee that your bf didn't do the same thing while he was in Dubai? </p>
<p>Maybe just talk with them? The situation is already out of hands, how worse it could get for you anyway.</p>
