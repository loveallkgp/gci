<p>I am a Gay and I know many social networking sites which gives a platform for GAYS to interact with one another. Even if is hard to find a soulmate and a life-partner but it is easy to find guys who are open about there sexuality and ready to meet for NSA fun or casual dates. But I have never seen any sites supporting lesbians. Even in GCI almost all the posts relates with GAYS. I know lesbians do exists. But how do they find each other ? It must be very difficult for them to practice their sexuality like we guys do....Hai na?</p>
<h1>GCI- Yeah, condition for them is more bad and in a country where most of the women are more sexually oppressed its does pose a problem to the freedom of lesbians, for girls are under more control of the family. There have been some lesbian confessions on the page too but they were like 3 or 4. Clearly we do have to wait for a lot of years for equality to dawn in.</h1>
