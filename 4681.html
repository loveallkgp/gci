<p>I can't believe i had this conversation with a stranger-cum-would-be-friend. Seriously gays exist who think like this, to homophobes ki kya load hai. So according to his theory, for survival as you cant live alone. If you are top marry a gal, if you are vers still marry a girl manage somehow, but if you are bottom you have a psychological problem your life is hell. And in India gay relationship is not possible according to him. Either i am living in bubble of false belief to find love or if i go by his terms either i should get married or die living alone. </p>
<h1>GCI- Darling, it's okay. There are a lot of people like this. He is in just bad bad denial and is finding a reason to feel okay about his false identity because he has not accepted his true self. He is scared of it. So it's okay. Don't let his thoughts trouble you.</h1>
