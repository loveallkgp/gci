<p>I came out to my mom yesterday after watching Satyameva Jayte... But as she's in kol n I'm in Hyd I told her through Texts. (BTW never come out through text or email always do it through phone call or a letter).
She's worried+angry+sad ... N I'm scared
We spoke a lot she asked who's filling my mind with such nonsenses.
I told her it took me 22 years to accept who I am and I don't expect u to accept in minutes... N I'm not doing anything wrong (I still am a virgin lolz) I think she got that hint... For me career is first ,there are ssooo many wishes to fulfill.
Oh n I forgot to mention my close friends n cousins know about me and they have no issues at all... My cousin said that I should go seek help from a counsellor ...
what i did Was it a dick move?
Cuz some say its brave n some say that I'm dumb to come out like that. What else could I do... My failed relationships +loneliness + fear of disownment made me do so...
Baad me dhakka lagne se accha hai na ki abhi lagjaye, ryyyyyyyytttt??????</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you have to be in close proximity to come out. That's what I feel. Anyways, give your mom a few days, week even because it is hard for her to process it all at once. Your entire life might be running around her eyes and she might be wondering where she went wrong. The next time you meet her, have a calm and mature talk.</h1>
<p>Just as a more understanding measure make her watch Bridegroom and Prayers for bobby. These movies can have a great impact and can alter the thinking of the person. Have a good time.</p>
