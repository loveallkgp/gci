<p>i m 23 still vergin(i m not complaining about this). I have a frnd in my class, he is very cute n hot too. 2-3 girls r having crush on him but he is not showing any interset in them. i m also having crush on him. Not sure if he is gay or straight. Last week we all batchmates gathered on frnds room for a small party. after party we all slept there only. i obviously managed to sleep near to that guy on which i had crush. it was very close n i was just sleepless whole night. because the room n bed was congested, i moved little closer to him. After making lot of daring i put my hand slowly on his chest, he didnt react at all, i guess he was awake at that time. After that i moved my leg on his leg, even though he didnt react atall. after that we were too close of each other that we were able to feel each other's breath. during morning, i covered myself with blanket n he also grabbed same blanket n we splet in one blanket only. i was expecting any signal from him so i could proceed further but he didnt give any signal to me. In the morning we were speechless to each other, i was expecting that he might say something about this but he didnt. Now whenever we meet outside we behaves normal just like nothing was happened. I want to make sure whether he is gay or not coz i dont want to loose the chance of relationship with this cute frnd!! plz suggest me something. </p>
<h1>GCI- If anything had meant to happen, it would have happened that fateful night and you guys are having that awkwardness between the two of you. Either he is creeped by you because he is straight, or he doesn't want to get closer to you.</h1>
<p>Damn, guys are so bloody complicated.</p>
