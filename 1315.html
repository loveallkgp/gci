<p>Hey its ma confession frm bindaas boy.....
I come to know bout homosexuality in ma hostel lyf... My junior introduced it to me.... Later on I was away frm all those stuffs nd started living straight life (not 100%). With time one guy entered in ma lyf nd v did everything. V lived every single moment of life vry joyfully nd I was in love with him, but he cheated me. Our relationship was for three years. But after breakup I came to mumbai nd I another guy entered in ma lyf, he is very hot nd I was magnetised towards him nd he also attracted towards me. So at first meet v kissed each other nd then our love story began.. But I come to know bout him dat he had sex with 200 boys., nd I gotta shocked, but still 2 I accepted him... But, two months ago v had a quarrel with each other coz of whatsapp, the reason was , he was always online but he nvr used to txt me...
So v had a big quarrel nd he said m not perfect nd blocked me....
But as I was in deep love I always kept txting him, nd one day he gave me reply....
Now the main thing is dat, he is doing d same thing again nd again, he is not replying me nd his behaviour have been changed....
So I wanna to know dat shall I continue with him by accepting him as he is or shall I leave him.....????
M very confused....</p>
<h1>Viv- The question can be asked is that can he be changed by your continuous efforts? Also, can you force him to love you...? Maybe he just wanted a reason to go away from you so I'd advise you to go in a relation with a steady guy.</h1>
