<p>24yr old from bangalore here. I decided to come out to my parents. i need help from you folks on what s the best way to do it. my family is traditional hindu south indian. i wanna put more examples of how being gay is not against our culture. Any help is appreciated. thanks in advance. </p>
<h1>GCI- Don't just say it out loud. If you know someone who knows about you, you can take him/her with you and then come out. Moreover actually prepare some educating material to explain your family. Take some examples from hindu literature. ALso, if they come out and say anything offensive, just don't loose your calm. You cannot expect them to understand you immediately and say, "oh goody! We always wanted a gay son!." This will take them weeks and months to finally digest it. Many things can happen in this time so be prepared and do not make any wrong decisions under pressure. Stick to the truth.</h1>
