<p>Hey admin,
I started talking to a guy on grindr then moved to Whatsapp but in a matter of 4-5 days, conversations stopped. I developed some liking towards him in this short time, which rarely happens with me but didn't tell him at all and since he didn't seem interested in chatting, I didn't message him either. </p>
<p>Last night I was very drunk, the max that I have ever been so far and I drunk texted that guy on Whatsapp. Those messages were bit cheesy, there was nothing wrong written in it but still cheesy. I had just explained my liking towards him in those messages.My sober self will not even think of writing something like that and in the morning when i realized what I had done last night, I messaged him an apology, he took it really lightly(at least by his messages, it looked like that) but I fucked up big time.</p>
<p>I am feeling terrible thinking about the incident and I don't know what to do. </p>
<p>On a scale of 1-10, how much fucked up do you think is the situation? And what do you think I need to do? </p>
<p>Regards,
A stupid guy</p>
<h1>GCI- I wouldn't say it's fucked up. You two were in two different places in the matter of feelings at a given time. Also, purely based up on your message I can't figure out that how fucked up it is. Maybe you think it's fucked, from his point, it's not fucked up at all. He just doesn't care about it. How his responses have been after that?</h1>
