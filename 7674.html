<p>She is getting married i am holding her invitation card in my hand can anyone imagine what i am feeling right now the person you love you cnt see going ! Thank you for listening sorry i am just out of my mind .</p>
<h1>GCI- I know it's difficult to see someone, whom you love(d), go. The fact that people are succumbing to the needs of the parents and society, and are failing to take the stand for their own loves, is saddening. That's why the individual rights in India are lacking behind. We say that we are a nation of brave people and blah blah blah, but it is hard for most of the people to take their own stand in front of their family.</h1>
<p>I am sorry if I went on a little rant myself, but it all comes down to being brave and embracing your reality. Same thing could have been done by your woman, the things would have been different. I am sorry for the feelings that you are going through.</p>
