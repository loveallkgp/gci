<p>Hi.
It was then when I was 12. We all cousins were playing hide and seek and I and my cousin elder to me were hiding in a room which was dark. He sudden came and kissed me and I was shoked and he told me not to tell any 1. I was taken to his bedroom and used a sex toy. He kissed me asked me to suck him and I even got fucked. Mu anal was bleeding but too he didnt stop and finally he let all his cum in my mouth.
I cried after all what has happen because I was not ment for this world. I am a guy. We had session till 3 yrs bak and now he is got married and having a daughter recently.
After that I got addict to this. When I was tensed I wud go with any1 of any age and hav his and cum bak and cry again.
I had numerous friends but friends as in were ment only to use me for things and later I was thrown in corner.
I look good with a good face but a little hair loss makes me look older and people never love me. The girl I loved got married. Now what am I supposed to do.
I dont cre people love me or not but d most impotant is my family loves me.</p>
<h1>Viv- Strange how some experiences always leave us scarred for life. I just wonder how many gay guys were molested by their family members. And how many are suffering through the pain till now. My dear, you just need a heading in your life and sex is not one. Try to exercise your potentials in some other things that can make you happy. Love and sex they are secondary things. Other things also matter. Like making a life.</h1>
