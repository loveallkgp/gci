<p>I hate the Indian laws and society. I am a vegan from a very wealthy family. My boyfriend or rather Ex boyfriend is a muslim from a not so affluent background.When he asked me out I had explicitly stated that I believe in animal rights so he would have to turn a vegan before he could (have the honour) of dating me. I might add at this point that I am fair tall and really good looking where as he looks like a crab (what more do expect he eats them) anyway after courting me like months i decided to date him. Later to my dismay I learnt that he lied about becoming a vegan to me and would secretly eat non vegetarian food. As soon as i was informed about his miscreants, i called off the relationship. Now the thing is I want to sue him for the trip we had together to goa, morocco and tashkent. I also want to claim the amount i spent on his armani exchange shoes, hugo boss watch, bvulgari perfume and gucci glares. Besides I also want compensation for his share of the dinners we had together at 5 star hotels and the amount i spent on his eclectic tastes of alcohol. Unfortunately even b4 i can think of a claim against him, i would go to jail for homosexuality which i definitely don't want to I will also have to face a lot of embarrassment and my family will also have to face it. But i don't wanna let that cheat go free. And to that mother fucker - i know that you Mr. Dickhead will read this post (a big fan of GCI that you are) god will never forgive you if you don't return my money. Go die in hell.</p>
<h1>GCI- Your confession reeks of fakeness and stupidity.</h1>
<p>That said, no one should be forced to leave anything, to accept anything, to behave a certain way and to be what she/he is not.</p>
