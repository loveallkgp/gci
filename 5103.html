<p>hi , I am roger 28 I usually give advice but today I need good advice , I HV been in a long distance relationship for the past 2 and half year ...our long distance used to be 7 hr journey apart by bus so we used to meet once or twice a month, now I got a govt. job at my own place and now we are 3000+ km apart ...we are still in touch...we plan to live together in future ..but recently I felt so alone and I started chatting to a guy who is quite well known in my state, he is a famous model, very good looking and all,hundreds of girls and gays. are after him .n we belong to same community n same language..I had a huge crush on him when I was in school n later we became friends on fb..after chatting on fb for few days ,we exchange numbers and he invited me to his place ...he fell in love with me at first sight or day 1 ..but for me I felt more of infatuation than love moreover I already have a bf...on 2nd meeting he disclose what he felt for me n he kissed me n hugged me .I didn't stop him either ..I really liked him but at the back of my mind I felt very bad cheating on my bf who is quite far away but I didn't tell him properly that I have a bf but I told him I have one ex-bf..after a week we made out and the next day I felt bad. that I lied to him and I have been dishonest to him..I told him the truth n obviously he got angry n we broke up...n now I am missing him so much n crying all alone ..at the same time I am really confused whether I love him or not because its hurting me bad ..but at the same time I love my bf too n don't wanna break up with him even though we are miles apart for the past one n half month....PS I know I HV been a greedy asshole..</p>
<h1>GCI- Yes you did wrong and that guy did right for breaking things up with you. You should never have raised his expectations in the first place. You cannot have the both at the same time. Just be with your bf and let things be the way they were.</h1>
