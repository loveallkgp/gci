<p>I am a young guy . I m in a relationship with a guy who is older than me from past 2 years. everything in the starting was fine between us. we also decided to settle down in future. but from few months he is torturing me mentally ,even in anger he blackmails me that he will upld our personal pics on net. I love him a lot BT at the same time m afraid of him. I don't wanna leave him .plz friends suggest me what to do?????</p>
<h1>GCI : i think its mere stupidity to have your photos or videos clicked in a sexual intimacy with anybody .and if you were not afraid when it was getting clicked why are you now afraid of getting them leaked ?nobody clicks nudes or sex tapes to keep it in there albums for memory .</h1>
<p>why would you do that ?? tell me one good reason ? 
now if he is blackmailing you , whose fault is that ??
first thing is leave him , no need to be with a blackmailer . 
threat him back and tell him you can take him to police for leaking any such images or video and tell him to delete all that . and next time be ware of recording such stuff even if a guy has married you . </p>
<p>and don't worry about pics getting leaked . people only spread viral pics of celebrities not normal people. tell him if he wants more pics .. i will send him mine .</p>
