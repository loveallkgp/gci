<p>I am 22, pursuing MBBS and i stay in college hostel. I have a friend who can be considered as one of my close friends though i hardly share private matters with him; partly because i'm introvert when it comes to private things and partly because i donot think that he shares the same wavelength as mine.
He's kindof attracted to me and constantly tries to be one of my best friends. But then, his attraction is not very physical attraction at all; his attractions and love for me come from a place of his respects or admiration he keeps for me!
He has a typical nature of becoming everyone's good friend and maintaining healthy relationship with people around (i donot); so there comes times when i feel special for him and then,moments later, i find him behaving the same way with other folks.</p>
<p>Well, he is quite good looking,cute,adorable and has got a fine heart; and all these things make me fall for him! Though i would not comment on his sexual orientations, but he apparently seems straight and has a steady girlfriend who keeps him warm in bed quite frequently.
But then, in hostel, he likes to rest his ass only in my room and hardly stays in his own room. And when ,at times, we both are intoxicated, he likes to kiss me on cheek ( though once bit my left earlobe n kissed on neck), tells me that he loves me a lot and we are brothers for ever!Though he is very conscious when he in away from intoxicants and keeps safe physical distance from me!</p>
<p>My life is jeopardized for the very existence of this guy! I am closeted gay and never think of coming out to him.
Most of the time i keep analysing his behaviours or whatever he does or says to me or others and keep hoping him to be gay.</p>
<p>I have a hell lot pressure in college and wasting time in daydreaming or fantasizing is not very wise idea!</p>
<p>ADMIN! Could you comment on this?</p>
<h1>Viv- Of course he is straight. A few pecks on cheeks and a nibble on earlobe doesn't make him gay. Sou you should really digest the fact that he has a girlfriend and you and him can never happen. The constant behavioral analysis will definitely lead you nowhere and you will end up being an utterly sad person. This behavior of guys is common in this age group. There is nothing gay in it. So treat him like a friend and also try not to jeopardize your friendship and your career. Ciao.</h1>
