<p>i m so confused ?? every time my bf asks me that he wants to love me i said ok then he plays wid me nd i dont feel gud so i stop him , he asks what happened ?
actually nothing happens but i don't like someone playing wid me but for him i go for it , once he was in very hard mood he tried lot but since m too tight he could not insert as he dont wanna hurt me . now i feel that for that will he leave me as for every guy that is also important, and he plays with me like kids play with teddy , ohh my god how painful it would be for pornstars .
meri ek aur problem m not social as m self obsessed and he asks for going outside all the time (mujhe to ab gussa vi ata hai bcoz bahr jane par uske pasand ki jagah pe jao , uske pasand ki chiz khao , now i hate pizza bcoz all the time he makes me eat that domios pizza but i want to have dosa and lots of sweets )
so wat sud i do? sud i breakup ???????????????????</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh come on! Who breaks up for that? If your bf forces you to do the stuff that only he likes, then you have talk with him. In a relationship go for the stuff that you both like. One day you go to the place that he likes and the other day you go to the place that you like. And I don't think that you love him to that level or even like him. Ask him to take a break from everything and then observe how you feel. If you are okay then breakup is the answer for you. If not, and you miss him, then you like him. As far as sex is concerned, you can try the things. I mean who can deny sex with their partner? I can't. :p</h1>
<p>And don't compare your hole size with that of pornstars. They do it all the time and it's their business. They do a lot of "stuff" to make the size big.</p>
