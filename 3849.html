<p>hi sweet admin ....hi to all .guys...my confession is about..my blind faith...now i m getting too much hurt..after met a moron....lil bit long..</p>
<p>it starts..3 yrs back...when i login on planetromeo..just like dat..no intetion for sex..or meeting..no date....one guys statrs to send me msgs..from utTrankhand..i also replied..nd in hurry i shared pics wid him..my real fb id also he liked me ..i also ..but not too much..just like dat ..no anything..we starts chatting..knows each other....decides to meet..but never succeed..during last 3 yrs..he talked very nicely..whenevr both of us on phone..we never talks about sex..or anthing like dat..genral talks we used to ..
then last month day came to meet him...i am from haryana..(i went noida to meet him bcoz he is now in noida for his job)..at evening..i met him nd i felt safe..wid him coz i know him from last 3 yrs..but dats our first meet.....oh god..when i met him..he smiled..but i dont know y i felt somthing wrong...anyway..we went his room...he hugs me..did body love n all.he wanna sex. but ..i didn't....then..he starts..walking inside nd outside his room..all time.. use to ignore me..i dont know..when i asked..thn ..he said he is busy..nd had outing..i said ok..then ..we went markit...all time he access grinder....on his bloody cell...moving fast in markit..i just chashing him like a little child...even i felt pain in vain of leg..but he didn't recognize..anyway..i never feet..coz he not my bf..thn he called his frnd..who is also a gay..he came..and all time he talking to him..i didn't know about his standard status...he is hi fi type nd user of branded things..his frnd also..
at night..he shared choclate wid his frnd gave by me ..which is of fruits nd nuts,,..oh my god..his frnd said .."ye to expired h..."but dats not like dat..any way..forgot dat..</p>
<p>next morning i had exam..he also said dat..he had plan for his frnds....i said ok..i will spent my day in delhi..after exam..
exam was ended at 1pm.. so i spend all my day on travelling in metro..and at cnaught place..alone...i thought why should i disturb those frnds..so at 9 pm he called me..whr r u.. im worried about u..i said sorry..i didn't call .coz i donna disturd u..thn he said..ok i m out of my room wid frnds.u reach at my room..i will be thr within one hr..i said ok..i went his room..his room mate( who is straight ) was there.. i was too much tired..so i went on bed..i wait him..but he didnt come..all night..i was alone wid his room mate..room mate also made scary sexy sounds..when i saw..he did masetrbate..while sleeping....</p>
<p>at 5 am he did call..but i didn't felt dat.coz i donno when my cell gone in silent mode...</p>
<p>any way i call him back..he said i m sorry yar..i dint cme...i was in frnds b'dy party...drunk also..so i didnt came..thn..i said..all night i waits for u....i gota go now.. thn he said ..mujhe tum se milna tha yar..i said..i came here just to meet u...i m going now...i came back from him..but i had tears in my eyes..y he did this to me..if he didn't like me..then he shud be clr..he must exused..somthing..so i can back form him suddenly at starting.. but he shouldn't ignore me all time...</p>
<p>after 4 yrs..aftr brk up wid my bf..i met this person..to whom i know from last 3 yrs...i really got hurt...one month gone..but all time the all story surrounds aroung me,in my mind...i loose all my confidence after meet him...even legs starts tremble..when i went outside from home..all time my heart feels pain..like hurting.....but he never msg again on fb..also..even didnt get response of normal msgs..now i m not msging him jise tumhari parwah na ho kyu usek pich zindgi barbaad krni. </p>
<p>i dnt feel love like thing ..for him..no feel for any type.. but...i felt low when i thnik why shud i belive on a person who meet u via planetromeo...nowww i feel that.. no gay will be urs... he can't be ur frend.or ur love..</p>
<p>real frends are just straight guy..no any one...A.gay is a big enemy of another one(even ek gay bhi jo khud ko staright ki tarah show krta h..dusre gay ko dekh ke galiya.deta h..aur majak udata h as like his frnd)..if u dont like some one..then plz be straight forward....nd make some excuse..u should go from him..but dont behave like this guy.... its really hurts..</p>
<p>REJECTION IS BETTER THAN IGNORANCE</p>
