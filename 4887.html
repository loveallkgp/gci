<p>My brother who is 25 and now finally economically independent, came out yesterday to our family. It's perfect time to come out when you're independent in all ways. Thank god we don't have a father who was too conservative and died 3 years ago. So, it was only my mom and she, after few hours of thinking, accepted my brother. Thank god, all our hard work and satyamev jayate's episode 'accepting alternate sexualities' worked well. He is already 25 and has a boyfriend and he'll bring him tommorow to introduce him to my mom.
I am 17, He told me about his sexuality a year ago. It took time for me to accept him and I am happy to be the first one to accept him.
The only person in our family who doesn't know is our grandmother who cannot look or hear properly- I would like to ask all of you, should we tell her? But I honestly don't think she'll understand anything.
When 3 years ago, our father died, thankfully he left enough money for my brother's education. I am happy that now he will play my father's role of supporting me. My brother today showed his bf's photographs and they do make a nice couple. Right now, my mom is busy preparing for tomorrow's feast .
Me? I'm straight, single...forever single :P</p>
<h1>GCI- Things like these do make me feel happy and hopeful for the future of India. Don't worry, boo. Maybe they both will find a nice girl for you.</h1>
