<p>I have a supar smart bf..He always make fun of me.His main target is my english. He makes fun of my accent even infront of his friends.When he introduces me,says"My friend has really bad accent, don't mind of it"..If I complaint ,I am trying to help you .it what he says..It's really annoying habit ..Even in my Birthday he gave me a spoken english book and a grammar book..He says when you write to me..I feel like you are writing hebrew ..you really should look your grammar. </p>
<p>$ABBY : i can see why he makes fun of it . don't get discouraged . he is helping you instead and if he is good in grammar learn from him . its okay . he is doing it for you . its better that somebody known is doing .. just think how many people who are not well known to you might be making fun of your bad grammar. 
everyone has problems but the thing is accept it and don't feel embarrassed . but just tell him to help you improve instead of making your fun in his friends . a good bf  wouldn't do that . 
if was at your place i would give him a slap. i am bad tampered .</p>
