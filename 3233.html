Dark Side
Mostly guys will not disclose about their dark side but i will in this post and in next post will tell about my real self. i hate this dark side but over the years i have tried controlling it. When i was sexually used and was left alone then i had that desire and urge of more. I was 13 i guess and i had my little cousin brother 5 years younger to me. Whenever we used to meet, i used to play with his dick he with mine at night before sleeping. I was not aware that what i am doing because i wanted it. Slowly i got accustomed to it and i started masturbating (ofcourse not infront of my cousin) but i used to do it daily. Then computer came and i made fake accounts on perfspot and orkut about which i heard from my elder cousins. There sometimes I acted as a girl and used to chat with straight guys and gays. I used to enjoy bcz that was my only source to overcome my loneliness and moreover i was not having any1 to tell me what is right and wrong. 1 day in school we 2 guys showed each other our dicks and we both liked it so during free time we used to kiss and play with our dicks. At dat time i remember i was in 8th standard. Desperation continued for having sex but i never had the courage of going that way. We both stopped as we got shuffled in 9th standard but play with my younger cousin continued till i realised that i m doing wrong with him. I m affecting his life. So in 12th standard i told things to my mother but me being sexually used and what i did with my cousin. Since then i have not done anything with my cousin and i m relieved for that but i keep a check on him so that he does not follow my footsteps. Along with that my urge kept on increasing, everyday i used to masturbate and sometimes i used too feel horrible.... but....... ( to be continued)</p>
