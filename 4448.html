<p>Few months back i told u guys about my younger cousin brother makeing move on me and how i scolded him little to strongly and drove him into closet(i am out 30 yearold gay and my cousin is 19)well now he is talking to me and keep an eye contact ,talks about his problem and stuff..and as per ur suggestion i havnt told his him about PR or to my friends of his age group...bt every once in a while he keeps asking"dada aapka tho ""hum"" jase frinds ho gaye milvao na mere ko..plzz".....now i know few trustworthy frends who wont take advantage of my baccha bt i am not sure if i should intro him to my gang or let him find his own way.
if i let him into my gang he will be spolied bt i wll be there to oversee him bt if i leave him on his own then ever possibe horror thing starts floating in my mind...
Well when i was his age i was along. i had good bad and worst time ...bt then i picked myself up dusted and moved on.......he is strong like his bhai bt .........element of doubt and protectiveness is there.....should i let him explore on his own or get him everthing plated on a sliver plate ......
one thing i can be definet about is that i cant see him get hurt......agar vo rooya tho rolane vale ki ma maa bhan ek kardu ga
.
.
.
.
.
.in my opinion i should let him go ....let him face the real world let him make worst choices
jo karna ha karo bt in limits ..cause i wont be alway there to protect him
wat do u think guys .......
keep him and introduce to my frinds..,find a lifepatner for him(aapne ka tho pata na uska kya ghanta dhund pau gA)
or
let him make his own frinds ......let
and guys dont write "go wt the flow" cause that no suggestion</p>
<h1>GCI- The best thing here would be to let him go but do tell him the know the difference between right and wrong. Let him make the mistakes and let him learn from them. But do tell him to be wary of the extreme conditions. The mistakes should be small. You don't want your baby brother to be a victim of money extortion case. He is young. If he has no control over himself, the can go to those levels where people can ruin their lives. So tell him what's right and wrong but do not force it upon him.</h1>
