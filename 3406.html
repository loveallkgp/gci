<p>"Hi friends, I'm gay. Wait a minute.... Am I? Really? May be I'm a ""Homo romantic asexual""!!??
The past few days have seen a lot of discussion on this topic. Now I'm really confused. I'm scared of any sexual activity right now but hoped to get over this when I met my special one.</p>
<p>Sex is something fun, passionate, spontaneous, awesome and not to be given out to every Tom, Dick (hehe, sorry couldn't help myself) or Harry you come across. I think the bisexuals, straight guys looking for fun ( I haven't been able to figure this out yet) have made homosexual sex very common. The real gays don't jump right into bed, they desire a much more meaningful relationship. For a gay like me entering this new world, I sometimes wonder and dream what sex with a guy might be like. I asked a friend and he said- use a banana. Really? Are you crazy? How could you? Food is sacred!!
So what I wanna say is- don't worry about the sex now, just find your special one and then things will automatically fall into place. I just cannot bring myself to think that I may be asexual. According to me sex is not the only thing on which a relationship can be based on, but is equally important in keeping a relationship going. You can kiss, you can hug, you can cuddle but sex creates a connection much beyond all that.</p>
