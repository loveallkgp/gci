<p>hi admin ... ..
probably i wanted my doctor patient confession to be the last one...but i got to clear something with d readers of that confession......
1) are u people retarded..???
if a person starts his schooling at d age of 5 he would complete his 10 2 standard by the age of 18.. the same year he clears his premed exam and joined mbbs which is a total of 51/2 years course...
so tell me how the hell is not possible to become a doctor at 23... :-(</p>
<p>2) i never said i did d operation.. offcourse it was done by the senior doctors(surgeon)...</p>
<p>3) presently im working as a resident at the hospital...</p>
<p>i think these people find it hard to believe that such romantic things can happen between two guys.... may be these people r interested more in top bottom shit .... or may be the people they always came across were more interested in sex than anything else...
wake up guys....
u find it hard to digest i think...
he he he...</p>
<p>instead of appreciating love u started criticising it... bcoz u haven't find it yet....... it doesn't mean no one is gonna find it..</p>
<p>raise ur standards.....
bcoz of people like u our society takes gays as an object made for sex..... the first image built in their mind.....
we have to make them understand that love between 2 guys is same as between a boy and a girl...
but how is it possible until u find a love story between 2 guys fake just bcoz its romantic.......
hats off to u guys.......</p>
<p>and a big thanks to all who have appreciated it and liked it...
:-) :-) :-)</p>
<h1>GCI- Its like some people behave as, "If I can't have it, no one can have it". The same thing I was discussing with my friends on whatsapp regarding your confession. You enjoy your life. God bless you.</h1>
