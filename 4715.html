<p>Wow you just showed me the mirror. Everybody has a opinion of others and should have otherwise they are lifeless thank you admin . I am a hypocrite and let me tell others who say "I should see a doc I am depressed and stuff". I knew I was gay since I was 18 and I am 21. I currently have no future because of my low grades thanks to my mental health .I had 2 bouts of depressive attacks and I currently suffer from paranoid personality disorder. I was misdiagnosed as a schizophrenic by my second psychiatrist which made me scared of doctors.I would never like to hurt my parents and siblings ,so I would rather be in closet rotting to death than hurting them . I know I don't imagine things when my "friend" spits rather vocally when he sees me because I am not normal. I tend to get frustrated and vent it out using unconventional methods. One fine day I found this page and I thought this guy (the admin) is happy and gay I thought that was virtually not possible so I decided to inflict my misery onto him .sorry man ."Every body here is gay-nympho with a fake id" was a really cheap comment .surprisingly SOME ARE OPEN and honest .
And to the bastard Sakshar Kumar who wanted to know if I had a brain this scientific jargon should be enough to fill the loopholes in your brain .being gay and a smarty-pants is tough especially in this country where being yourself is a crime.</p>
