<p>Salam namasty to admin and my dear friends of gci.I am ammar khan from pakistan,in pakistan no lgbt rights available and no one can openly admits that he is gay.I m a natural i like boys only.I had relationshp with my young cousin he is a handsme straight guy,in 2007 we did last sex,after that he told me not to have sex again,even now we meet as cousins,he dnt love me as a bf but he know that i am crezy abt him.He has many stri8 frnds but i feel jalous when i see him with them.I never moved on in my life coz i cant gv his place to anybody else,and in pakistan 90 per sent gays are fake,plus i have very hard number of glases.Becoz of that i dnt hav even stri8 frnds.I dnt knw what to do i m thing this from last 7 years,now i wana move on can u tel me which country is best in my case to have a whole life with a gay.I m a lawyer and wana move from pakistan coz here gayism is sin and crime.</p>
<h1>GCI- Great! Move to a gay friendly country where you can live your life the way you want. Canada is great for it. It would be difficult for you to settle at first but if you get a right partner, it would be awesome for you.</h1>
<p>And if anyone says anything hateful here, I would not think twice before banning him from the page. Happy commenting! :)</p>
