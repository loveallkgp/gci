<p>How to deal with fear of being mocked publicly and fear of public criticism?</p>
<h1>GCI : mostly i have seen only those people will mock you those who are near you . so keep it clear with these people if you will bite me , i will eat you up . no need to be overfrank . know few pwoplw who won't make fun of your behaviour , your voice , your way of walk or your way of dressing .</h1>
<p>and in public , don't get attention . try to ignore even if some butthurt points out something ( as we don't want to get into fights) . </p>
<p>when you show people their limits they won't take you lightly . and stay away from bitching , mocking of other people . because it happens when people hear that you said something about them then they start mocking you . maintain a distance from boys in your school or college which you know are bullies ..don't talk , don't sit , don't say anything and don't look at them . you will give a finger they will take a hand .</p>
