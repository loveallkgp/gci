<p>hey admin...u r doing fab job..</p>
<p>i wanna share one incident wth u all...
M basically frm maharashtra bt nw in hyderabad for gate preparation..ace academy is famous abt gate coaching...so i joined it since 23june...before week one incident hppnd...our network teacher strtd his lecture..after two days he saw one guy was staring another guy...he point out him nd said,'whts wrong wth u...concentrate on stdy..dn't do ths...ths is UNNATURAL'...i mean WTF man...he is well educated teacher even though he is calling homosexuality is unnatural...he has homophobia i thnk....even after tht he passed joke on homosexuality after tht everyone strts laughing...i feel so bad..m jst abt to cry...bt one thng good happnd tht our clss strength is 350-400 students..so whom he exactly pointed nobody dn't knw..otherwise tht guy may suffer frm torture...
Wht i wnt to say is...teacher should not be talk such thngs in clss..i mean opposite to the homosexuality bec der r many students who r unaware abt homosexuality or lack of knowledge of homosexuality...nd students blindly follow the teachers...so they also made der mind set as homosexuality means unnatural thng..so i feel vry bad at tht dy..i wish i may get chance to stand againest tht teacher...</p>
<h1>GCI :  see educated doesn't mean brad minded .  a well educated person can be 'narrow minded ' and a fully ilitrate person can be 'broad minded' . broad mind is a 'gift given by birth' and  education can't give you broad mind.. but you can work on it with will .</h1>
<p>secondly if my teacher had made such comment i would have explained it wisely .... get my parents called on by principle but sure i would have taught them moral values which we were been taught as a kid in a school . 
you  teacher is a douche .</p>
