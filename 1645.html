<p>my experience with dushyant rao. ( NO HATE INTENDED... BUT STILL I LUV U )</p>
<p>i met him on pr then became frnds on facebook and then on whatsapp .. since august 2013 i was chatting with him... in october he proposed me n i also accepted his proposal .... as i also fell for him... in march i became serious for him.. i used to chat him daily . like everyday n i didnt even irritated him.... .
on 17 march 2014 morning i found that he blocked me on whatsapp and facebook too.. his last msg was ..
.
.
"" LETS NOT GIVE EACH OTHER A PANIC ATTACK ""
.
.
.
i just cant understand this.. i didnt even get what he meant.. n i suffered fir no fault of mine..
he promised me that he will not leave me like my ex did... but i realized that all his promises were in vain... . .</p>
<p>khushi ki umeed to kisi se kro hi mat .. tension .. dukh . dard hi milta h pyar me..</p>
<p>saccha pyar to naseebo ko hi milta h ...</p>
<h1>Viv- Listen, if it was a long distant one, you really shouldn't have gotten too serious too soon. But the damage is already done. Its really bad to be left without a reason. You loved him but he didn't value it. So let the blame be with him. You try and come out of it. And next time when you go to date someone, don't just say I love you too soon. Date a guy who is comfortable and sure about himself being a gay. In that way you can filter out those for whom relations don't really matter. Try and be calm for the moment and focus on other things rather than these negative thoughts.</h1>
