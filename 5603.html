<p>So here is the thing, a month ago I met this guy through Facebook. I really liked the way he looked so I invited him home. He is just 17 and an engineer student, six years younger than me. We had some snacks and beer, than I thought that we should make out a bit but he said that he is not in the mood. The same thing happened a few days later again, he just comes to my flat and sits, neither talks nor does anything. Although I really like him a lot and I think he does too, we watched almost the entire world cup together but he didn't say anything. We didn't even touch each other. Sometimes I think he needs help with this expression issues, I don't know if I should take him to a psychologist or not. I don't even know if he is gay, and if he is, is he potent or not. Should I not see him anymore. To be honest I need to be physically and emotionally intimate with a guy to be happy. Please suggest. </p>
<h1>GCI- Whatever you want to do, do it with consent. And remember that he has to be 18 to have his consent to be counted. Get him to talk something maybe? You can always initiate the conversation.</h1>
