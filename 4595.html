<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>Hope everyone is doing good and enjoying winters.</p>
<p>This is not a confession, a conversation with you people out there rather. I am originally from NE India, the land of rivers and hills. I am 26 years old and presently, I reside in a hill station of North India.</p>
<p>I grew up with my Bordeuta n his family. (Bare papa) I never saw my mother n my father barely came to see me. He worked in Kaziranga with the forest department. Ever since my childhood I was a melancholy and morose kid. I barely talked to people. I was treated as a burden in the family but I must say, I owe them a lot. I had a slight feminine kind of body language and some of my friends used to mock me. I still remember an evening when I was bullied very badly by a group of seniors while coming back from school and I cried and cried and cried. This is just one example. There are many such incidents. Life felt like a curse to me as I discovered that I get attracted to the members of my sex. Teenage times were too difficult. With the absence of my parents and the cruel world to which I was subjected into, I became a patient of depression. My academics were the only part which made me smile and move on. I passed my HSLC n HS with good marks. After my HS, my bordeuta told me to search for a job and that was the time I left their house as I wanted to study further. I pursued my graduation on my own money. I used to work for a newspaper and they provided me accommodation in the publishing house. 3 years passed. I had a sexual encounter in that period but it kind of made me feel guilty. I never wanted to go physical with a one day guy. I completed my masters with the help of a scholarship. Now I am working as a PGT in a reputed school.</p>
<p>Okay so my life was never easy. But I chose to help myself. Now a days I see so many young boys just seeking for sex and only sex. This is not a healthy behaviour. You create fake profiles and the profile pictures u upload there are just.........
Its perfectly okay that you are homo but it is your responsibility to develop a healthier society of homosexuals. Utilise your energy in constructive purposes. You have a life other than sex. Make friends of your kind but don't just go on discussing only stuffs related to sex n physical unison. These things can have fatal consequences.</p>
<p>I live alone now. Amidst green, books n students and yes, m happy. :) These children r my world n their smiless make me happy. Value this life friends. Miles to go. Carpre diem. :)</p>
