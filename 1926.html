<p>Hello people.
I am 20 years old sikh sardar guy. wanted to share a story of mine with y'all.
wen I was a kid, i used to stay alone at home and at school also. wen I was around 8 years old(I dnt remember d age), my cousins started using me for sex. i wsnt aware of this thing dat wot all m doing is wrong. i started liking men at d age of 12. but i didnt know that i ws a gay. i changed my school in 10th grade.A guy liked me, he used to kiss me on my cheeks and he wanted to hav sex with me, he took me to d school trip wen i was nt able to pay d trip fees and he paid for me. wen we were coming bck, it ws night time,he kissed me alot of time in d bus,. but i was taking it normally as i used to stay alone ,there was nothing like frndship for me.
After 10th, in 2010 i went for engineering to Sangrur(punjab) , i took admission in certificate course( 2 years course equivalent to 11th&amp;12th grades). i used to stay in hostel. i ws very upset there, i felt very lonely, i used to cry, one of my room mate left and the other used to stay smwhere else. there were guys from my city also but i didnt talk to anyone of them. one night, my classmate came to my room, and ii ws little happy with dat, he wanted to sleep in my room so i said ok, u can and he got one other guy with him who ws frm my city and who was the topper of the entrance exam. there were two beds in my room, i asked dat i will sleep alone and u guys share d bed. but the topper came to my bed.. we slept. after d midnight, i felt like smone is trying to kiss me, i opened n rubbed my eyes n saw that topper was coming closer to me. and suddenly he put his lips on mine n started kissing. i felt gud too as it ws my frist time. and after that we slept. In the morning i was going for bath and he was standing in front of his room, he put his head down and entered bck into his room. i passed off.
Slowly, we started talking to each other, and he wanted my frndship where as i wsnt interested.he did alot to make me happy, helped me in studies, took care of mine, and one day he cried, he said he is leaving the university. den i felt sad, and accepted his frndshp. we had sex alot of time, he 's straight and i dnt hav any problem with dat. one year passed. we came more closer, he loved me alot and i loved him too. we ate together, slept together, woke up together, everything ws so beautifull wen i ws with him, we used to hav fights bt he always talked to me no matter wot where as i ws the one who started fights..
people were jealous , they didnt want us to be together. they used to create misunderstandings between us two but we ignored all because we trusted each other.And i ws so perfect, i made an electronic project and the teacher asked me , from which shop did u buy this. :( felt sad, but ignored dat too.
Suddenly i started falling sick because of the salty impure water there.. instead of getting promoted to diploma, my health took me bck to home. i felt very bad, used to cry for nights, and once my mom cried with me, she said i can do anything for u, but u r nt well, how can i let u go there. and she knew abt our frnshp too. again i started staying alone. we used to talk on fone daily. he was also feeling lonely in hostel. He asked me to make new frnds, i made one but he ws money lover. i stopped talking to him too. It took a year to recover.
In 2013, i took admission in sm other college in my city only.
I made a fake i.d, started searching frnds , bt didnt get any. And i really stay happy as he wants me to stay happy always. i dnt cry like people dat all are fake here n all, every1 has their own choices i guess. Keepin it apart, i concentrate on my career which is more important. I called my bestie(topper) and i told him dat m a gay, he didnt gave any reply, he faught with me, and he said there is nothing like gays. be straight, but i explained him everything and he said it's ok but first ur career and till dat stop all this fake identities and he accepted me. he said he loves me alot. and i should not worry abt this, he is always with me.I deleted dat fake account.
It"s 2014,
Didnt get sm cool frnds in college. (topper)He is my best frnd, i miss him alot. he lives near to my home around 25 kms away , he invites me everytime he comes for holiday bt i dnt use to go. I feel that i will be in same condition wen i'll meet him. but now i will meet him nxt month.
And m still searching a guy for me.
thanks everyone for reading, hav a good day :)
Stay happy:)
And thanks admin for posting!!!
p.s-plz ignore the mistakes(if any)</p>
