<p>I like to read confession and I feel to suggest. but when I see Viv's suggestions, that ruins my wish to comment. I don't know it is good to say or not but I feel to comment or advice but Viv already advice, this makes me feel like Just read confession and move to next.
Viv's comments are always helpful to people which is really good stuff. But personally I feel it restrict the social activity of members.
When ever I feel to comment and I find already an advice from admins, this makes me feel that you are of no use here. A good confession bring good debate among people, better expression of but here people come to doctor and doctor gives medicine, then its displayed over fb - thats it. I can't see more than 3-4 comments.
There must be a reason that people are not able to do so. Confession pages are interaction medium between confessor and members not only confessor-admin interaction.
I don't have problem with Admins, the are really nice and doing good. But this is what I feel. and I some times even don't wish to read confession.</p>
<h1>Viv- Every brain has different thinking and everyone can come up with different suggestions. If you want to comment then you can comment. Why is the admin's suggestion keeping you away from doing so? And as far as comments are concerned, maybe it is because there are some genuine issues here and not the sex seeking thingies.</h1>
