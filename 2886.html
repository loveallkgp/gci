<p>Feeling weird about gay love:</p>
<p>I don't know from where to start my confession but I'll start it from the climax.
My gay best friend grabbed my hand and pulled me in the bed and hugged me tightly. I thought maybe isse bi mujhse pyar ho gaya. I kissed him on his forehead, hands, cheeks and said,"I love you". he replied with a smiling face, "I know". I kept on repeating myself 3 times but he never said I love you. I wanted to kiss his lips and express my true feelings for him but he said I can but only as a best friend. I refused.</p>
<p>I am kind of a person who always had true and bold emotions for him. my love for him is brave enough to face my parents also.
All I always wanted is him to love me back. somewhere deep down he knows he'll never find a guy like me.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do now, since then every second day I cry, I love listening sad songs only.
I'm not in depression but I am sticked with him like glue to paper and if I try to severe myself from him, I'll be torn apart :'(</p>
<p>My only wish is to have him forever as my boyfriend, Maa Durga ki kasam kabi ni chodunga usse. I hope someday and very soon he'll understand my love for him is like diarrhoea, it can never stop!</p>
<p>Guys please pray for us.</p>
<p>I love you yaar and I know you're reading this kutte, Terre liye muscular bi Baan raha hu, weight bi loose karlia, Tu maanega kab? :'(</p>
<h1>GCI- Everything is fine... but your love is like diarrhea? That's one smelly comparison. Eww.</h1>
