<p>well iam a final year student and i think iam having a huge crush on a guy in our class..he is decent and straight guy and it is two years i spent with him in the labs and in class.i never show that iam attracted to him but acts normal towards him..
during lunch times in canteen i used to sit close to him and some times tried to keep my head on his shoulders and whenever i sit at te back bench of him i love playing with his legs...even though he is a hot guy he did not have gf's
i really like him alot and just want to move more closer to him..but iam in a fear that it would ruin my relationship with him.if he rejects me and make fun of me what should i do..i just dont know what to do.??
i love him a lot but will he understand me??i take many risks and stand him for him in every way
what to do guys???</p>
