<p>Hi, I am very curious but I am unable to get answers. My ma'am has told me to make a school project and I have chosen 'LGBT and Homophobia'.
My questions-
1. In gay relations, which man gets pregnant and which does not?
2. In lesbian relations, can both women get pregnant?
3. What's the LGBT population creation rate?
4. are there any gays who go on dates with woman and marry them?
5. Are there any lesbians who go on date with man and marry man?
6. In earlier times, were gay man forced to kill themselves (so to practise sati) when there husbands died?
7. What is the rate LGBT abortions every year?
8. Why children of gay men do sometimes better than other children?
9. Is there any LGBT record of harappan civilization?
10. where there any gay kings after 5th century BCE in india?
11. Why are people homophobic?</p>
<p>I have submit this project for my final exams. So I used facebook to fine experts and came here. My social science teacher- Chaya ma'am is very strict. I want to submit this project before 18th. If I don't sumit it, she will cut my marks and I will only get 5 out of 20. I don't like chaya ma'am because she is strict.</p>
<h1>GCI- If these are the questions you chose for your project, then I guess your teacher is gonna tear your response sheet on your face. And I am just saying this just for the questions.</h1>
