<p>Hi admin. Thank you for this wonderful page.
Please post this. I would like to hear from you.</p>
<p>I'm 22, just started working. I took a long time to accept myself as being gay. Finally happened just a few months ago. I used to meet guys for fun earlier while I was still discovering myself. After accepting myself, I thought I would be over it and needn't meet guys until I get a bf. But I don't think I can mange. I want someone to romance, to share a little physical intimacy. At present, I romance my pillow. ;-) :-(
There's a lots of straight guys who want to have fun with gays, which I feel is strange. I've had fun with straight guys too and they tell me it's a phase that I'll get over. It actually does, at least for a few months, then I'm back to square one.
Now my question is- Is it ok to meet guys for fun? Or should I hold on and wait for my prince charming? Please don't suggest watching porn, I've tried all that.
I also have a doubt if I'm really 100% gay, since I never dream of sex. My dreams are usually romantic ones with cute guys. I'm thinking of coming out to my family now, (since I'm almost financially independent). So want to be sure of myself.
PS: I don't know if this is related- I grew up in all women household- grandmother, mom and aunt. Could this have influenced my feelings?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well we all grow up in totally a heterosexual scenario which is everywhere around us. We never see anything different out in the open. So how could it be possible that a female dominant household could make you gay and the situations around you could not change you? Are you getting me?</h1>
<p>Anyways, as for meeting guys for fun, I guess its your personal choice. If you are an adult and it happens by your consent then we cannot judge you. If you want to find the partner, go ahead find one!</p>
