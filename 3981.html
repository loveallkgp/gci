<h1>GCI- Didn't you just objectify yourself? So dear bottom(because you said you are), anal walls are not as elastic as the vaginal walls and they cannot stretch beyond a certain limit when stretched. The blood was caused by the tearing of your anal walls. Now you had the chance to read about having anal sex on internet before getting all cozy to prepare yourself of the coming situations, but you didn't. You had pain and you saw blood. DO NOT have sex for a few weeks and give that pit a rest.</h1>
<p>And about the poo-poo stuff, its the shithole, darling. What else do you expect to come out of there? Cotton candy?</p>
