<p>I never thought I would confess in here.... I ve always been strong for myself. I just wouldnt let things get to me. If I behaved otherwise then I would be in trouble. Life taught me that lesson in a hard way. So, I kept things to myself pretty much. Everything about me should be kept normal, I made sure of that so no one would know. I m a closeted Gay. Revealing it would cause more trouble than good. So I planned to reveal it at the right time and the right moment. Highly orthodox family, expectant parents, gossiping neighbors and peering relatives - not one was under favorable conditions.
I just didnt know what the reaction would be. I wanted to know what people -" who knew me"- would think so I turned to my trusted friend. She is my best friend. I always found it guilty not letting her know. So I planned to come out to her. I told her I was Gay. I half expected her to atleast scream out of surprise and run in the opposite but all she said was that she already knew it and was scared that I would never come out. Too bad I had to let her know that after school, atleast we would ve had lot of fun. She said she noticed me when she used to wait for me during my hockey practice in school. I would just stare at the shirtless hot boy in our practice session instead at the ball. So, the first coming out was good.
I mentally knew how my parents would take it. They wouldnt even understand it. My father disowned his sister just because she loved a man from her office. I planned to warm them a little about that topic... I made them watch a episode of a gay man in NatGeo's Taboo. My Dad, during the program, said such people should be hanged. I hastily changed the channel. It is never going to work... I will just have to run away once I m stable. I m still in college. I dont play hockey here even though there is a team. I m scared it would give away to anyone else. I always loved playing that game. But like many good things in life it too had to go.
It is a very bad decision to turn your back to parents but I dont want to spoil any girl's life. I wouldnt let them know where I would be... I m scared they would hunt me down and kill me for staining the family's reputation. Once I m stable I will create a National wide awareness program for the LGBT society so no one would be losing their parents anymore... I dont know still how many youngsters will go through this I dont want anybody to feel this way... I ve also planned to have a IVF baby from my own sperm. So that my family would continue just like my father' s wish... I can be a single father by choice in that way. I just hope everything goes according to plan. </p>
<h1>GCI- It will go according to the plan! Stick to the truth and nothing will halt you. All the best!</h1>
