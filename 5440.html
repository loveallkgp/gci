<h1>GCI- Well, in this case you have to do what's best for you. I cannot force you to do something, nor anybody else can. Think from both sides also like what is the guarantee that you will have a happy life with a girl if you marry her. Marriage is not about just living together like friends. It's about getting into each others space, literally. If you can't have sex with your wife, you married life will be ruined anyway. Maybe it is the time for you to take a stand.</h1>
