<p>I am 20 and I have been diagnosed with Anti Social Personality Disorder (ASPD). The terms "psychopath" and "sociopath" have originally been coined for people with this disorder.</p>
<p>I am a popular kid at college. I am known for being patient and understanding,  outgoing and loud, and a nerd, all at the same time. My professors love me because I am a highly active person for a lot of college administrative activities and resourceful when it comes to getting students for any work.</p>
<p>But I am ruthlessly curious and manipulative, when it comes to understanding human minds. I am in final year of my undergraduate course, doing Psychology. And when I find a person interesting, I become highly sympathetic towards them, become extremely understanding till they begin to trust me completely. Then I start manipulating their behavior to see how they react to things and advises. The end product is usually them being happy, and my curiosity being quenched. And then I lose interest in them completely and break of contacts.</p>
<p>The same things happen when I am on Grindr or Planet Romeo, I get to know guys but after I get to know them, I completely lose interest and stop talking to them. I have never been in a relationship till now because I have never sustained interests in anything but getting into lives and losing interest in them once I understand them.</p>
<p>I am known for my charisma, "sympathy", and I am one of the top students in my college when it comes to academia. My professors also think I am going to be one of the finest psychologists. I am working on my first research paper on social justice, not because I believe in it but because I find the idea very amusing. I have some interesting findings.</p>
<p>ASPD is a Personality Disorder and Personality Disorders cannot be "cured". They are a part of a lifetime of personality traits. </p>
<p>But amidst all the boring humans, sometimes I have fallen for some, despite of how boring they can get later, I lost interest after having brilliant conversations with them. I don't feel guilt in hurting human beings in any way when it comes to answering questions. But after I stop talking to them, I feel lonely. I feel everything is becoming increasingly grey and amidst crowds of people buzzing with life, everyone with their own tales to tell, everyone going with hopes and joys of going back home or to places to meet people they love. And I feel alone amidst that crowd. With nothing to relate to. Mind still buzzing with questions.</p>
<p>My psychologist attributes it to a high IQ. My "friends" attribute it to me being a ruthless human being. I attribute it to an unquenchable curiosity which no one seems to share or understand, bound by too many social constructs.</p>
<p>But despite such answers, I feel lonely.</p>
<h1>GCI- Of course you will feel lonely. For once, you should stop psyco-analyzing people around you.</h1>
<p>Anyway, the solution to your issue is hidden in your study. Apply some therapeutic measures to yourself.</p>
