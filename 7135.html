<p>Hello beautiful souls. :) I need some advice.
I met a guy in a class that was for 3 mnths. We used to look at each other only. Never talked. But clearly both of us were interested. Now matter how hard i tried i was never able to break the ice between us two. The moment I'd look into his eyes, I'd freeze and my expressions would be like a deer in the spotlight. well, I'm kinda introverted but he's not. but talking never happened. Now only a  month was left and I finally decided a day I'd finally talk to him. But something happened and he kinda got miffed with me (WITHOUT EVEN TALKING -_- ). and he never showed up again.
I had no clue that he'd stop coming and...I kept waiting and waiting and waiting looking at his spot, looking at the door everytime if he might show up. But he didnt. I couldnt ask his friends for his number coz that'd been too awkward.
There was something btw us. Something special i know. But i was afraid to make a move because I thought he deserved someone better...I know i sound lame but...well I wanted the dude to be happy and I was not sure if I was right one for him. BTW, I dont look bad. In fact I look rather good ( and I hate that coz I get unnecessary, unwanted attention; well good-looking people have their own problems trust me ( in very humble way btw, dont go on mocking me :P )) 
so where were we? Yes, good looks. that is all i have. When u look closely, I am socially awkward, boring, sports-hater (he loves sports btw) , utterly-serious... and list of self-hate goes on.
 :/ :( 
So  what I wanted to ask you is - should I find him and talk to him? I havent been able to get him outta my mind even after 8 months now.Liteally everyday I think of him and try to hate him for misunderstanding............................argghhh. Tell me what do i do? Contact him? ( I can! ) or not. What if he hates me after finding that behind the pretty face he liked is a clumsy man? :( I cant live with that. Wow, I sound like a gay-drama-queen lol. But these are true feelings.</p>
<h1>GCI- Do you even know his name? If you do, you can always search for him on facebook. Trust me, I have done and found people like that. ;)</h1>
<p>Find him on facebook, start texting and see how he responds.</p>
