<h1>GCI- Well u see that morons or intelligent people dont have it printed it on their heads...its seen in their actions... I feel sorry for ur friend who got beaten....but remember never let go anyone that easily...u must show people the mirror and be ready to see it even urself when the time arrives...</h1>
<p>P.S- I m not advocating revenge....but don't let anyone use u as their personal dust bin....NO ONE IS WORTH OF THAT!</p>
