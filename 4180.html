<p>From the same guy who wrote "Bitter truth of gay life in Indian society" a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Was away from internet and tv for some days because of something. Yesterday only came to know that Aamir Khan got a legal notice for promoting homosexuality in his show Satayamev Jayate and the advocate involved in it is a lady, Mandeep Kaur. Infact we have nothing to do with the gender.</p>
<p>But in actual Insanity starts from here. People like Mandeep Kaur are the reason that someone who is young, at tender age commits suicide as he/she finds it easier than to live whole of his/her life fighting against the society and with it's own sexuality. Instead of supporting him/her, they say its a disease, you should consult a psychiatrist, apna dhayaan bhagwan mein lgao sab thik ho jayega and bla bla. BC Mujhe to ye samjh nhi aata ke bhagwan jab Akal baant rha tha to ye log saale the kahan pe. Means being in 21st century, how can we deny to accept the facts which is there from ages?</p>
<h1>GCI- Ugh she is just a newbie who was looking for a big break in Law. She thought she would get fame or whatever. She did but she never would have imagined in what direction it was. Anyways, 21st century or not but judgmental people will always be there. And there will be people who will be the thekedaar of religion and will use it to put others down. Best way is to ignore them.</h1>
