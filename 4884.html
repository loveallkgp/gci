<p>I am a straight acting guy...for the past years even if I was attracted towards boys I would just say No to myself as its hard to survive in this society in this way... and even if i dont care about society than I used to think ki "what wld happen to my parents if its disclosed..it would be hard for them to take it and the people comments will make it worse. Just with this fear I always try to control myself. I would like to confess(better word be share) that I have met people before but neva got any strings attached but few days I met a straight acting guy of my same age group and within few days we became best buddies. Within no time we gained a lot of trust of each odr..we used to go together around the city, spend tym together blah blah...and might be a conincidence that we have same things in common related to behaviour, likes, dislikes etc. My mind says NO but my heart says Yes for the fact that I LOVE HIM and he loves me too. Its the first time for me that I am emotionally so much attached to a guy. He was like a unexpected person for me at an unexpected time. He took away all my pain and We both got a person to share our all typz of feelings and problems for first time in so many years.
The bond grew very much stronger in few days itself. It all appears so strange for us to believe it as hardlyy 15 days and it was like we knew each odr for years. But we took it as a part of our destiny. I would just say that I love U my bitch. U r my brother cum best frnd cum love. I trust u a lot and will be der for u always :P
I will always HATE U because
wen i hate u .... I have to forget u,
If i try to forget u, I start missing u more,
n the more i miss u...the more I fall in love with u again and again. :)</p>
