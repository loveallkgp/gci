<p>Hai....
am om..,am in lv with a guy,,he too love me like anything...,but da problem is he parallely loves more guy too.....n he say that"he want both of us in his life...",...even he says we both are like his two eys...n he is not ready to loose any....,an i know everything about other guy.....but other guy don no anything about me........,since frm childhood i never expected second relationship...but y i am wid him i don no......,many times i tried go out of his life but always i end up wid failure......because i love him like anything....even i could die for him.......wt to do....am in dilemma....n..i cant live widout him.....</p>
<h1>Viv- How can anyone be in love with 2 guys at once? Is this relationship a game that you know about this second guy and that guy don't know about you? Hmm, talk with that second guy and then ask his views. I don't think that this situation could survive for long. "Even I could die for him" has no use in life. Be a bit practical also. There is always a choice in situations like these. Choose the correct one.</h1>
