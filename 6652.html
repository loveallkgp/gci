<p>Well I told the straight guy who 'hates' gays that I like him over drinks 2 weeks ago. He took it pretty well. He says that as long as I don't want to sleep with him, its fine. He's turned out to be completely different now. He spends time, long durations,  we go on long rides and have a good time together. I hug him and have kissed him twice. </p>
<p>He went home on Friday and I kind of screwed things up. I drunk texted him that I love him that same night. Next morning I was upset over how he would react. I even typed a message here thinking I would send it if I he doesn't call. </p>
<p>He called last evening and said he understood that I might have got sentimental! He's gotten so understanding and contrary to what you people suggested I'm inching closer to him. Last two days were the worse... felt empty without him.</p>
<p>Now I know you will say that on inching closer to doom, I'm attracted to him because he's playing hard to get, in infatuated, I'm drawn for other issues... I'm just posting this for my peace of mind. And yeah... Feel free to call me immature etc ;p</p>
<h1>GCI- Just one request DON'T SCREW UP ANYTHING..the ball is in your court now..Rest you know what to do and I know u r not an askhole.</h1>
<p>Muaah!</p>
