<p>Hello admin !!!! I would like to share something with people so here it goes..... When I was 13 year old , I had one of my friend in my neighbor.. We became friends... Actually, he was my first crush and he too liked my company.. One day , we were sitting alone in home and he kissed me... Cuddled me.. I liked it too.... But sometimes he h had tried to touch my dick.. But I didn't let him do so.... This continues for 3 years.... Then he shifted to North Delhi ...... Now, it has been 4 years.... I still love him so much ... He is also added in my real ID... What should I do? Should I tell him that still love him ..? What should I do now ? Please help me !!!! He is my first love..... (One more thing I m too living in Delhi.....)</p>
<h1>GCI- Plan a day together and see if he is still interested in touching your pee pee. If he is then your love is of no use. If he isn't but he is still gay so you can say it on his face!</h1>
