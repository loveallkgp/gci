<p>hello GCI</p>
<p>17 here.. just gave HS exam.. now I'm free for a month..</p>
<p>so i thought to make a PR account. and then while being online on it, i got a message from a guy. i went through his profile. he was 56 years old. profile was nice. the intros n about person's things, so i replied him. he talked to me very nicely.. we exchanged no. i was comfortable with him because he didn't drag a sex topic neither he asked about roles nor he asked about my previous sex date. </p>
<p>and last Sunday he called me to have a coffee in a random mall.. i visited . then he asked if i can go to him house or not! i was okay with him so i decided to go.</p>
<p>he took me to his house. </p>
<p>damn his was simply awesome... i thought he was a normal middle class person like me. but he was very rich..
he has three maids.. 
he took me into his house. he showed and explored each n every corner of his house.. i loved it... but i realised that i didn't see any pic of family photo inside his house..</p>
<p>but later when we were having lunch.. i asked him ki where's his family? wife? children? ..</p>
<p>he said he'll after lunch.. as he said after lunch we went to his room.
he then started telling about his life.. he's the only son of his parents.. when he came out as gay at the age of 25-30 ... his parents didn't accepted him and they made a separation. it was obvious situation as it was in early 90s. he went away from his parents.. as he was working in government office.. it wasn't hard for him to settled up with new hope and house. </p>
<p>after few years he heard his parents died.. and all the sad situation.. he met many guys who proposed him , he accepted few but all of them were after him for money only. few guys decided to go away from him because they were bisexual.</p>
<p>and all this things he were saying.. he was too sad when he was saying this. he wasn't crying but i could hear his voice which was explaining he was crying from inside.. and he even said he likes to have sex but at this age his body doesn't support him . sometimes few guys come to have fun as he pays them.. </p>
<p>the situation was really different that i can't explain here.</p>
<p>i was feeling very emotional but i said nothing.. not even a word..because of this he smiled at me n said don't feel irritated.. mujhe kuch samjh me nai araha tha kya bolu.. but was really sad for him.. </p>
<p>he also said something to me that he has property of crores but he isn't happy with life. no love in life. so for his satisfaction he donates to some charity every month and kinner ko bhi every sunday he gives thousands.</p>
<p>don't mind my dearest uncle if you are reading this. I respect you man. :) don't think that i was getting irritated.. your company inspired me.</p>
