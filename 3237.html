<p>Confessor of Confession #3233 
Earlier i thought that i should give a break on my dark side and tell u guys about my real self but i think i will keep that part for the last...... Some of u might hate me some might understand but i need to share my these years with u.. Your feedbacks are and will be appreciated...... </p>
<p>my urge kept on increasing, everyday i used to masturbate and sometimes i used too feel horrible.... but....... i knew that i cant control it...... 11th and 12th shifted my focus to my studies but still i was masturbating and in touch with facebook not so often ofcourse.... In 2010, when i took admission in engg colg, the return of that fake me aroused again bczz dere were so many hot guys loitering.. I desperately wanted sme1 to love me but i wasnt worth it bczz of my dark complexion and at dat tym i chubby not now ofcourse.. During my this fb account i had phone sex, smtyms during sex chat i used to play as top and smetyms as bottom bczz d guys i faced were like this only..... First tym when i met a guy, i personally didnt lyk him bczz he was not of my standard nor well educated and sophisticated.. He wanted me to fuck him but i didnt... Then dec 2012 changed my life.... This guy came into my life... He was like what i wanted but he is very much unhygenic... We have been in physical relationship not anal ofcourse but i dnt want to be my bf but at the same time he is over possessive about me.. We are more of best frnzz rather than fuck buddies.. My problem is i m unable to remain loyal with him... I hv this urge of meeting new guys... i dnt know why..... Behind him i met 2 guys only for foreplays.... I m guilty for that but i cant help... Either d love i want or dat craving for love is not yet achieved... I dnt know... I m getting short of words.. But yeah sometimes i masturbate 7 times a week ofcourse n smetimes it exceeds and i feel lyk dat might affect me in future while having a baby as i m a bisexual and i will marry a girl.... I dnt know but yeaah right now i am having this fake account and i am betraying him as he doesnt have bczz i forced him not to so that he doesnt affect his studies where as i m affecting my studies despite knowing the consequences..... Most of the time I get erection and my urge for pleasure increases... I try controlling it by not masturbating a week or two but at the end i again start....... I feel like i m a bad ass who cant be a gud lover or bf or husband..... He thinks i m perfect in evrythng not looks ofcourse but i knw i m not at all perfect and rather worst...... This part of me is not actual me and i dnt want to keep this part.... Real part of me is way opposite to what perception u might have created in ur mind....... My next confession will tell u about that..... To be continued..... Admin ur genuine comments and suggestions are must....</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay now, time to make some decisions. You want him as your bf or not. Figure that out. If you do, then you got to stop fooling around. If you want to remain just friends, you can do anything you want guilt free. Masturbation is fun but too much of anything good is also bad. Try controlling it. And considering the level of your desires and all, do you really think that you can keep up with the marriage in which the wife will expect you to be loyal? Train your brain buddy.</h1>
