<p>Hello friends ... I m a bit stressed ... m 20 years old . Born in kolkata and brought up in tamil nadu ... at a very early age I gotto know that m gay . I was just 8 when I was brought to tamil nadu and since then my bad luck started ... I was put in boad for like 1 and a half years and then I was brought back home .. I met this guy .when I was in 5th and he was in 12th . I don't know was it love or was it just lust or interest . We made out a lot of times . Banda was really cute then .. I knew I m gay and I guess the guy who was in 12th as well knew he was gay ... we guys became friends first . Because the boad which I was put into hardly had any north indians and we both were the only north indians found together most of the time ... then we came close and then every evening we used to meet and make out .. I don't if I loved him or he loved me .. but whatever it was I enjoyed and so did he .. and all of a sudden at evening out of nowhere I just pushed him away and I ran back to my dorm promising him to never see his face again . I don't know was it my stupidity or my misfortune I just pushed him away . I came back home then and since then my life turned hell ... I had no friends since then untill past year before last year I completed my 12th .. I went against my whole family to shift back to kolkata ... and I luckily did ... and there I too didn't make too many friends but yup out of a better surprise . I did make two ... and I m out to them ....I came back to tamil nadu because my mom fell ill behind me ... and I had to drop down my studies . I was anyway not into studies but I wanted to live my life with friends for few years .. I never had friends made before .... After coming back to tamil nadu I lost my grand mom who was the only support in my life . Who I could blindly trust . And now it had been 7 months since I m back to tamil nadu and it had been almost 2 months without my grand mom. .. my life has become even more lonely than I was before . I hate south indians .. here . I m into my dad's business and my business is going good . But my personal life sucks man ..</p>
