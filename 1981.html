<p>Same guy of #1973</p>
<p>My friend is a good man, pure hearted and kind.You guys told me to move on with a new guy but its sad that I am not interest in gay relationship except with my friend which is hopeless.Many times I told him his lips were sexy that I want to kiss him but he took as an insulting joke.He even told me once my lips look sexy like Katrina Kaif,he never did that before he is very conservative but he never hates me for insulting him except touching his breast.He hates it.After that incident i moved out from the room.We are still very close,I keep massaging him,hang out with him,etc.His behaviour is so cool and innocent,with all his killer looks I bet every gay will fall for him.So,sometimes I thought just because I'm gay and he is so attractive there is nothing special the reason I fall for him.Last time I told him he looks sexy with his face full of beard and i like to touch it.He let me,but after few minutes he turns from supine to prone position on the bed and told me I should stop that cause he got hard.I cannot force him.Manytimes we tell each other how many time we masterbate in a day,he usually did 5-7 times a day but not everyday.And he used to feel really bad for masterbating.I asked what he think of while masterbating,he said their face.what a innocent!!..Whenever he urinates he always wash his dick.and by the way he keeps telling me I look good and smart..Guys I can't move on over him!When I met his girlfriend for the first time I'm hurt,I'm the one he keeps telling everything between them.Now I have a thought before his marriage I should ask for his kiss for my happiness in my life!!..damn gay love sucks!!!</p>
<p>I nvr spoke out of my G-life 2 any1,I read all yr commnts N feels so good.I want to thank you all.And my apologies for my grammer mistakes in my previous confession though non of you complain.I am happy.Stay blessed you all</p>
<h1>GCI : well you are one drunk in love ... once you will get a big kick on ass your brain will start working again . anyhow ... best advice i can give is ..don't write any further message coz darling you are in no position to work on any good advice ..as your mind is stuck</h1>
<p>and what breasts ???? men have chests .. no matter how huge , bubbly , big they are they still are called 'chests' ...</p>
<p>and about that 'katrina kaif ' thingy ... don't get that thing go into your mind . when i was teen men told me my ass looks good.. but then i figured out they were all teen and were horny.</p>
