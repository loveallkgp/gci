<p>Hi mates, I'm 24 and a student. Here's my confusion/ confession. It's a bit long but would appreciate if you can read it completely.. Want your advice please..
I actually see a little bit of myself in many confessions here.</p>
<p>I studied in a co-ed school, I talked to the girls as well as the boys. When guys started developing crushes on girls, I didn't. I didn't consider anything amiss then, just thought it would take a while for me. I loved spending time with my guy friends, but I found my "friendship" getting a bit too strong. Something didn't feel right and I started avoiding them as much as possible.
I joined college and people labelled me an introvert, I didn't care. I've never given a girl more than a glance but with guys it's quite the opposite, I strike up a conversation with cute guys. They find me "different", meaning I'm not into sports, bikes, action movies, fights, etc.. I'm a rather quiet and well mannered guy, usually considered the goody two shoes in my group. I never use bad words. I notice little things- like if my friends are wearing a new shirt or shoes and compliment them on it, even if it isn't so good. I do this just to be nice, not expecting anything in return. The music I listen is usually old melodies and the current hip hop and rappers just put me off. Everywhere I go, people appreciate my good behaviour, my good taste in music, etc.. I don't particularly like it but as long as they like me, all's well.
Most of my friends feel shy to talk to a girl, but I don't have a problem. I actually mumble a bit when talking to a hot guy. So ultimately girls never attracted me. I found this out when I was about 16 or 17. So assumed I was gay, though it took a while to accept it. Recently I created a fake id on fb, met a lot of friends. I had an account earlier which I used to meet guys for casual hook ups and mutual fun. I enjoyed it but never ventured into sex. I was scared. Anyway, back to the present, most of the guys I meet, have/ had a romantic relationship. I've never been in one. I've had crushes, if you can call them that. I would wait to see a particular guy at a street corner, I try to sit close to cute guys in college and on buses. Thinking of it now, it makes me wonder if it was all done in lust, since I didn't know most of the guys I had a crush on. I also get uncomfortable when guys talk about sex. I used to watch regular porn earlier, thinking it would make me straight. But the guys were always more interesting. I also never interact much with girls. Some people call me old fashioned since I usually consider the practical side of things. When I go to a friend's home, I end up talking more to his dad or mom or grandmom compared to him.
If you did read the whole confession, I'm really thankful to you. I know my thoughts are jumbled up... Now, where do I stand? Am I gay or bi or straight or gay curious? Do I need to interact more with girls to know? I watched Satyamev Jayate and could perfectly understand and connect with Deepak. All help appreciated....</p>
