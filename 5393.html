<p>Hi there , to all those who are reading this and are suffering frm the same amt of anguish and hatred tat I sufffer frm nw
Even though this is nt a coming out of closet type of an confession or a sex wala confession bt its a lame confession
I seriously just don't get why do people have to be so cocky all the time. I m kinky and to explore myself I wanted too open an acc so tat I cud meet different people (males) . Even though I hav made frnds bt most of them are worthless .actually all of them are worthless
Is sex the only destination tat we want to go ..I m nt saying tat I don't want it bt does tat mean our conversation starts wit sex and ends wit it. I feel quite amazed tat all here are mostly just coz of their sexual wants ..huh ..can u just say why is It so difficult to find sumone interested in talking rather than action all the tym .I meeet either a super excited moron or and overly depressed chap and surprisingly they don't hav anything to say as if their lyf starts and ends wit sex .
I just wanted to say its k tat we want sex bt its important to talk as well . People here are so cocky as if they are professional models . They only mind their business . If u r hot then I wud txt . If ur cock is big then only I wud txt . If u giv ur facial pic then only I will txt . If u r nearby then only I will txt . This is the attitude.
Lastly salute to all such morons who hav nthing got in their lyf other than measure others cock sizes and mid finger to all who are nthing bt internet gigolos always eyeing fr sex rather than having some quality chat
FUCK OFF !!!! </p>
<h1>GCI- We all judge but some people just overdo it. I really feel sad at our generation as to how they are going younger year by year.</h1>
