<p>This article was in Gujarati and about recent suicide of AIMS doc whose husband was gay printed in Divyabhaskar dated 21/04....
I was shocked after reading that. The columnist says that why some people and NGOs offend the supreme courts views on 377. He says that why do people rally such as gay pride and all.... He also says that after watching this and reading columns that encourage someone to be gay is okay, people become gay...</p>
<p>What a rubbish article.... It personally don't worth a penny but if such type of articles is published in the well known news papers than people will get wrong information and to be gay in India will be more painful....</p>
<h1>GCI - See dear..those who write in the newspapers and those who are into print business they are also from this hypocritical country...even i have friends in the mass com department of my college and they are like what is being gay all about?? I mean seriously dude....if u really don't know..then what the hell are you doing mass com for??</h1>
<p>This is nothing but the consumerism mindset which actually makes us think that newspapers nowadays..DON'T REALLY MATTER...until and unless they give QUALITY news..and for them..the topic of homosexuality is a hot cake...which maximum of our country's double standard LITERATES love to eat. </p>
<p>P.S- Our country has dropped 20 ranks below in terms of media press and freedom..to expect SOMETHING REAL GOOD IS EQUAL TO BEFOOLING  OURSELVES BY DAYDREAMING IN A FUCKED UP COUNTRY!</p>
