<p>HOLA peeps . Welll Thiis Confession Is for The so called popular sushant divgikar. I was a big supporter of him n I like him as a gay public figure but Now After Bigg Boss I'm Changed. I mean dat guy is so shy he is not able to keep his point when he talks with salman , he is representing da Lgbt Group . I know Admin says that obe should be the way he is but still he is not able to keep his point n den he does shy actions nd is not at ol entertaining . he trid earlier to be entertaing but he is damn boring . if u r in a gameshow like thia which is world famous . you have to entertain da crowd . he just is a shy guy who always tries to show some attitude by shakeinh his hairs around . I am not against him but yes if he is representing us. he is portraying da wrong us . thats ol :)</p>
<h1>GCI- You would hate him either way if he tries to entertain also. You'd say "why he is acting like that and all load of crap." If he acts a certain way, people have a problem, if he speaks a certain way, people have a problem, if he doesn't speak, people have a problem. People say he is not the face of LGBT community and now you are saying that he is representing us. I guess we are at an impass here. You got to clear your views first.</h1>
