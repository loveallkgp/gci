<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was recently introduced to your page through a friend of mine. I have few things to share, please find the first one below. Would request you to address me with my real name, Anubhav Sharma.</p>
<p>"Hello folks! I was recently introduced to the page by a friend. Since I am a kind of person who doesn't share dark secrets easily, I thought now it's the time that I should speak my heart out to feel relaxed, so here I am.</p>
<p>At an early age only I came to know that I am a homosexual. Whilst going through puberty, when sexual feelings need to arise, I was deciding on what I am going to do with my life. I decided that I will find a life partner and would spend my life just like any other families around me. Living in a small town restricted me to open up and speak about it as I knew how people would pursue it. I kept my feeling within myself, which with time was growing into the motto of my life.</p>
<p>For graduation I came to Pune, which allowed me to experiment and understand my sexuality and role properly. I knew I would prefer the role of the taken and not a giver. I went on some sexual dates, which certainly didn't ended well as I never went on to do everything. Whenever I did, I could hear my heart saying that this is not what I want. This reduced my encounters to one in 8-12 months making me still a virgin.</p>
<p>During these years, my heart did fall for a guy, who was in my school. We used to study together and just like any other school romance, I never knew when I fall for him. I kept the communication going despite shifting to Pune. I was living in a dream world despite knowing that there is no future. But, one fine evening I decided to just speak my mind out, once and for all.</p>
<p>That was the last time I spoke with him. I took years to come over it but I think it happened for the best. I have been living in Pune since summers of 2006, have met a couple of people, made some good friends but my heart is still empty from within. It is searching for that one particular person who would be my life and with whom I can grow old and share some great experience.</p>
<p>After a long time, almost 8 years, I realized that a guy grabbed my attention. Since, I already made a mistake of giving space to a person in my heart, I am very nervous this time. My heart is saying that this is the one, but my mind keeps on reminding me that I should not get move involved since there is no future and nothing will work. After having been crushed between the heart and the mind, I have decided to leave everything in God's hand, if there is any.</p>
<p>There is a lot of similarities between us, but I should understand the possibilities of us coming together. After all, you can't fulfill every wish of your heart, it's just emotional and doesn't understand the logic connections between things. I hope I am doing the right thing by just living my life, with all smile in my face created by mind. Let my heart fall for him, see his picture and read his messages again and again, but my mind knows that the possibility is less. With time, things will wash off, and I may find someone better. Why it is hard for heart to think straight? Why it just has to fall for anyone, like that?" </p>
<h1>GCI- You are already thinking like it will never work out and you will find someone better. This is the kind of thinking that stops people to feel satisfied with what they have. If you feel for him and he feels for you as well in the same way, so what is stopping you both to be together? You can always exercise caution to not take any swift step and think logically from the brain to every situation. For a person who is kind of a hopeless romantic as you, can find a way to keep things together and not let them wash off.</h1>
