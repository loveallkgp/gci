<p>disco deewane everyone ^_^ !!!!!
this was the incident happened with me when i was  7-8years old i think.
there was a function in our family and we had to move to some 20-30kms to attend it so we all got packed in the car.that time i used to get excited most of the time to insist my father to teach me driving and he was also knowing that it  was not the right time to do the same.but our driver was keeping an eye on me and he told me secretly that he will teach me how to drive etc. but i think that was the shiitiest promise someone did to me.he invited me in the car while function was going and then he started his trap to go round over me.
he told me to suck his dick as it tastes like an ice cream you should try it.he  forced me to pee over him and he licked all the pee in his mouth etc.then he attacked my ass and started licking like hell.that time he was telling me that this is necessary for the driving and i was doing it. then i lost  my senses and he pressed his dick in my mouth like hell for some 2-3 mints .i was not protesting it bcz i was just unknow to all that stuff.
the most intresting thing, i think i got a sleep hangover there :3 .my father came searching me and found me asleep in the car and moved back.
i later realized when i reached 8th standard and felt a huge guilt over my heart and i used tocry in bathroom, bedroom, classes. in the past 15-16 years it was very difficult for a kid to excrete such shit in front of their parents so was the same with me.</p>
<p>later i found myself gay but i think some threads in our brain are used to stick together in the childhood deciding the person's interests etc.so these thread got a break by this incidence and i reached the level of being gay.i think male dominace in many processes like in sex also decides the nature since he was a dominating factor in my case so i moulded as a gay.</p>
<p>around 9-10 years of my age, my cousin brother did the same thing with  me when i was enjoying school holidays at my mama's house .he is 5 years older than me. he introduced doctor-doctor game and sucked mine and forced me to suck his.that time i cried alot  but he somehow managed to not let me bark anywhere else.because i found this as a clashing stone over the kind  image and sound of being good boy i never told this to any one.</p>
<p>i have now taken an oath,promised to me to do something when i settle down in near future against child abuse.nowadays as the internet is growing, children are very smart but some geeko type kids like me may get some courage to discuss if they ever experience a trap like that.
god bless admin for your kind service to maintain this page O:-)  :-* for u.</p>
