<p>Hey there..
how are you all and admins?</p>
<p>i wanna share something with you guys, actually in needs some fellows who understands my thangs.
so here it goes..</p>
<p>i have few gay friends , actually bestie, who often keep on sharing confessions of this page..
i have noticed it numerous times.
so few days ago i saw a post of this page which was shared by my friend  about a guy being molested sexualy in his childhood..</p>
<p>so i thought you guys could understand me.. and counsel me to what to do next?</p>
<p>so thing is that when i was 7-8 years old, my aunt gave birth to a baby, my cousin, i saw my aunt with big stomach on those complete 9 months.
that made me to think how it works and blah blah..
and i often used to see some weird dreams  in which even my stomach was big and gave birth to a baby on next dream..
i used to say this to my mom and dad..
they used to laugh on me and ignored it by saying I'm too cute..</p>
<p>and that was my childhood..
and again ..
last year I was seeing my pregnant bhavi and after 9 months giving birth to a baby..
and all those month till now Im again getting those dreams .. which made me to go to my childhood.
but at this time .. I'm really getting the feels  of getting pregnant and to give birth a baby.
i don't know why i seriously want to get pregnant .. 
i said this thing to friends , they laughed on me, again i said this to my girl, she broke up just bcoz she thought I'm gay.. 
i said this to my gay friends ,even  they said I'm gay, my soul is a girl trapped in male body..
then i said this to my parents, they said its my disorder, it'll be okay by time but its shameful..</p>
<p>yaar..
I'm not gay,
neither i have some feelings for male..
and thinking about disorder I'm getting mad.. 
its not normal i know, seeing getting pregnant on dreams on daily basis making me to go on depressions.. already n i seriously want to have my own baby.. 
what should i do? where should i go?  i have already made a confession on other pages too.. they said its height of chutiyapa.. fakepanti.. oh fuck.. </p>
<h1>GCI- Are you in any case intersex or trans by mentality...try to find more about urself and then meet a shrink for it, because its not a fucking disorder but some kind of unaddressed emotion plus a great part of your unique sexuality.</h1>
<p>And yes don't burden urself with it, it is normal for many people of the world to be unique in their own way.</p>
<p>Love and hug from our side.</p>
