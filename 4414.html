<p>Hi everyone, came out to my maasi whom i am very close to. She first was shocked but later said i had become gay because of a curse. When i was born in my village the kinnars had visited. But my father refused to pay them. So they cursed the family. I also feel that could be the reason because I am not like other gays shown on tv and movies. I met a few gays and they also are not like me. They all have a loud personality. My maasi wants me to talk to a kinnar and see if the curse can be removed. Has anyone been in such situation. Please please help me as I want to be free from this pain. Everything else in my is perfect except this one thing.</p>
<h1>GCI- Have you learnt nothing from the page? Stop trying to find reasons for your existence. Being gay is not a result of voodoo, curse, hex or some effing jinx. Its in your genes! Tell your maasi the truth but first get yourself educated. You are in the dire need of some nice education because there are somethings you cannot change or help and being gay is one of them.</h1>
