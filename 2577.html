<p>Is there any medicine to cure gayness? Some say that yoga and meditation helps. Infact one guy has suggested that a course 50000 rs wala helps turning gays straight but I am doubtful. Some say that gays lack the male hormones. So would injecting the hormones help. Please tell me I am really confused. I don't wanna face the comments and taunts of people. I wanna get married n have kids no remain a sissy throughout. </p>
<h1>GCI- 1) There is no cure. No medicine or yoga can cure it because whatever sexuality you have, its not a disease.</h1>
<p>2) Don't fall for expensive treatments. It is fake to extort money and nothing else. 
3) Every individual has a mix of both male and female hormones. Increasing the quantity of testosterone cannot make you straight.
4) Families are not the jageers of straight people only. Gay people can also have kids. 
5) Don't take any wrong decision just because you can't face the society. Don't be a coward and accept yourself as who you are instead of looking for cures and wanting to fit in.</p>
