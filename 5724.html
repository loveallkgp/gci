<p>Dear admin</p>
<p>I am still confused about orientation mean. Its all about sex ,people just want straight damn thing cover up in words and relations. and why LGBT world become so damn pathetic it become so technical ,still world not adjusting word GAYS, they invented new terms tops,bi,vers etc... what is the need of bifurcation ?? its like selling things in market with proper tags. When i see confessions here i find its soulless and not LGBT issue.Its just about flesh and pleasure. If LGBT community needs place in mainstream society it must have some stand of its own ,so as per all equality rule. So does only sex will be ruling factor in this community or something more.?????</p>
<h1>GCI- ORIENTATION is the basic tendency to get attracted towards a particular sex as u may know. HOMO, HETERO, BI are such nomenclatures! Asexuality also comes under this stuff...</h1>
<p>Ur problem involves the question of sex, ethics and homonormativity.
1- Issues can be from personal to political...so stop thinking overtly serious.
2- LGBTIQ's stand is plain ACCEPTANCE and ACCOMODATION..
Homonormativity based on heteronormativity must not be there.
OUR VERY EXISTENCE IS AN EXAMPLE OF BEING IN THE LEAGUE YET NOT OBEYING THE LEAGUE OF NATURE(as perceived and advocated by many)...
3- U must understand that people have low morals today..and lgbt are no saints either..they are also common people with flaws. So stop expecting us to be superhumans!
4- When there is more suppression than what is required then all hell breaks lose and then we must fight for a larger cause.The cause of our EXISTENCE!!
5- What u want is an utopia...but an utopia can be realized by those who have realized themselves. I will quote MARX here...THE PERSON IS POLITICAL....and that starts with being personal!!!</p>
<p>P.S- Till then keep fucking stupid laws and people.</p>
