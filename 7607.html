<p>I am a gay boy from Chandigarh. Recently came to know that my cousin sister is lez. She came out to her parents and they went mad. Maasi came to our house and cried a lot saying she tried everything sycatrist, beatings etc but she won't change. My mom suggested to get her married soon and that to within the family to another cousin. That way he can always control her and news won't spread outside family. Maasi agreed. I feel so sorry but can't do anything. I am also a lifetime closet case.</p>
<h1>GCI- I can go on and on on this situation. Fucking over interference on family is the worst thing ever. Let the kids live their own life and let them be happy.</h1>
<p>I am so sorry that your sister has to go through suck tough times. I wish you could provide some help and courage, but you yourself are succumbed to the pressure. Sigh. </p>
<p>And then we say that we need change, yet we don't want to change. We want the change to be spoonfed to us. Honestly, it is annoying to a whole new level.</p>
