<p>hii every one m in trouble 
 m 22 nd my bf is 26 , prblm is related to my career  as m engineer , nd i hav recently joined one of fortune mnc of the world , since m fresher there i hav to work hard so during my office i do not chat wid my bf .
i dont know wat has happened to him he says m changed , m not loving him as nd mu fst choice is my career i try to make him understand that i hav always time for him nd i love him lot.
when i was not doing job he always said go do job  now he is saying he need that time as i gave him but how can i yar i wake up at 6 nd leave for office at 8:15 as i hav to reach there at 9 nd leave frm office at 6:30 nd reach home at 8 nd then i msg him , now he has stopped msging me , calling me  even i went to meet after office to meet him at 9 o clock somehow he did not come there , at that time i was broken seriously when i need him most he is doing bullshit.
i dont want break up i want to end misunderstandings wen i say this to him  he says he dont want to play blame game  , wat to do yar m totally messed up frm both side in office seniors nd boss nd after coming home bf is sad.
wat to do ,? how to overcome this issue , i dont want end our relation ? he is elder than me still he acts like younger to me.</p>
<h1>GCI- Awww u poor baby...ok let me put it very candidly for u to understand and u may act as u  wish.</h1>
<p>1- U are not in a mess....u r just trying hard...and ur bf is not able to comprehend bcoz he is not that mature to understand. WE ALL HAVE PRIVATE SPACE AND TIME FOR OURSELVES...let him learn this...
2- There are people who are superficially matured ..ur bf is one of them!
3- U must not try too hard to make things easy ...don't even try to be the saviour of a relationship...if it is really strong it never breaks and if not then its just a charade!
4- Maturity comes by our actions froom the roots of empathy..if he cant do this.....he will regret!
5- If a person is not regretting to lose u he doesn't love u deeply.
6- Initiate a conversation and ask him just one thing- when i m doing what u always wanted then why this double standards???
7- A real relationship is when u understand each other's silence...
8- U only lose what u cling to, so don't treat anyone as ur better half....we all are complete...we need companions of life..not complainers for life!</p>
