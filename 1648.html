<p>hai viv and abby hw r u guys? actually right now i hve some thing to confess to which happened in my 12th and now i m in engineering 2nd year in punjab (lpu). Being a proud gay inwards but not out to the world except some friends they know partially that i like boys, let me start my confession i am 18 years when m in 12th there is a guy named sandeep who likes me like a cup cake and also treats me as a cup cake i wasnt aware of gay thing and also about my sexual orientation but i do no that i like boys and i want to hve sex with them totally i hve done sex with 15guys totally not internally fore play , oral, only with two guys i had internal sex it was gud but i never liked to be fucked becuz it hurts a lots but i go high if i see anyone handsome and sexy. now let me talk abt sandy he asked me one day suddenly in my 12th that do u want to be my friend or lover as the question is so interesting i agreed to do love and even sex with mee but he never dared to do sex but he use to kiss me a lot that my lips r always wet only, to be frank he used my lips as a icee cream i felt it. the important thing he even celebrated my birthday even on the same day he quarrled with my best friend sathvik becuz he thought that m dating sathvik also but one thing is sure if i am in realationship with some one i never see other ones untill i hve break up considering this sandy being more possesive about me he is becoming pushy day by day i just ignored him, he used to come to my house and hve sex and lot. last day of my clz i said him m sorry we cant be together anymore becuz i dnt love u anymore i love another guy he cried a lot and even he scared me that he may suicide but i totally said wat do u from if i dnt like u hw can u make me forced to love me then he cooled and said k i dnt harm myself say me who is the guy u love then i said he is ur best friend karthik then he jst shocked and said, wat who everyday wants to fuck u u love him i just said yeah but actually i dnt love him i just said to save from sandy but wat sandy said to his friend is i loved him a lot the next day he came and as he is homophobic he started bullying me and trying to save him from nt saying i love him but actually i dont want and even i dnt love him wat do u guys suggest waht i did is wrong or right guys rejecting some one pushy and so doubtful.</p>
<h1>Viv- Dude, how do you clear the exams? Atleast start using fullstops. Bless my brain for understanding your confession. You did totally wrong for leading that guy on. You used him for sex, you used him for your happiness and then you just removed him from your life? How in the name of God you have the thinking that you can be still right in this scenario? You could have used him just for sex, no strings attached. But no, you had to play with him and while breaking up you gave up the dumbest excuse possible? Ek bacha bhi iss se achha bahana bana leta hai. You could have asked him to not get so pushy and demanded some personal space. You didn't do that either. Damn damn double damn! College khatam ho geya hai na? Ab un dono se door hi rehna. I won't be surprised if they confront you and slap you together.</h1>
