<h1>Ash 19,</h1>
<p>I am not a sex seeker but have enjoyed my sex life with hell lot of fun and adventure.
If I turn pages of my diary I got a name, Jitendra. He is my mother's friend's son. He is one of those with whom I had sex. It was my 12th grade when I started with him and after a year, I bored of sex, after getting into a relation, sex was not in my mind then.
Jitendra was perusing MBA, and was living in a hostel. Whenever he come to his home, he make me a call to hang out and I always neglected him. He was a sex worm only, whenever he call i ignore it, then I pick it up and make an excuse.
For long I did this, all that frustrated me and I straight away said no to him.
He blackmailed me by saying, "I will tell everything about you to your parents".
My temper was on hight and I said with a courage, "Go to hall, do whatever you can do, and lets see what you can all do, but remember you are doomed after that", "good bye honey huh".
With an anger I waited for his call but he the called me, I picked up and he said, " hey I was joking, I wasn't serious lets meet.
That was the moment when I abused him on his face and blocked his no.
Whenever he see me, cant match his lusty eyes to me.
I learned that everything is good until you are with truth and faith. Confidence is the energy of the battle to win.
Life is short world is more enjoyable than sex!!</p>
