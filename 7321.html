<p>Hi i am doing my final year BE....i never shared anything about my self in class or to my close friends ....recently one of my friend in my class lost his mom....past days i don't talk to him much....few days later he returned to class everyone in my class comforted him as my part i also talked and gave him some energy....then two days later we usually travel by train he sat opposite to me as soon as i started to talk he grabbed my hand and gave me goosebumps ...he held my hand throughout the journey ...like this incident happened thrice .....sometimes he used to stare at me in the class...once i found out he was staring at me and saw him in the eyes it juz gave me something  through out my body......................i dont know what to do now as i developed some likes for him and also started avoiding him what will happen i started to speak again with him i am so confused</p>
<h1>GCIL- Dude!!!!!!! Its sympathy multiplied with ur latent homosexual feelings rushing to surface by getting the catalyst...</h1>
<p>Don't you guys get it that every intimacy is not love shuv te dirty chicken?!</p>
<p>P.S- I see depression and too much of loneliness in that guy, try to know his mental state instead of lingering with him like an opportunist for ur drama u wanna term love.</p>
