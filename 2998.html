<p>Hey you all my brave fellows I'm a girl and your biggest supporter for your rights. My shweetu brother is gay and he told me about this sexuality a year back. Till now our family has seen many ups and downs because our parents were not accepting it. I instantly took charge of my baby bro sat down with him and listened to his whole story. Trust me the things that he told that happened with him they shook my soul. Later he confessed about it to our parents also who then felt sorry for their behaviour. I am glad that we are one happy family and my darling brother is the awesomest of all. I have never seen such confidence in him after he came out earlier he was too much introvert. I love him like anything including the kinky things that he does with his boyfriend. They both make a very beautiful couple together.
All are not as lucky as my bro but life is never the same for anyone as change does happen. It is all upon you on how to bring the change.</p>
<p>PS- I have a boyfriend. You don't have to be LGBT to support LGBT rights. You just have to be human. </p>
<h1>GCI- Such a sweet confession!!! God bless you and your family! You are a perfect example of how a family should be!</h1>
