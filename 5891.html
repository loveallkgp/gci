<p>Hello friends I just want to know koi ek banda kya Kise ek ke saath nai rahe sakta.... I just started to date a guy for sumthing serious Suddenly he come across with a guy on Facebook and he started ignoring me though m not ugly n I m smart then y he did this.... I just wanted to tell u switching on new guys doesn't make u fall in love this only showed the reality of Yours that what you actually looking and what u are... m happy me tere see baach gaya.... Its really difficult to find Good guy....</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmm...trust me babes..people who are confused souls, innate bastards, selfish and plain narcissists just don't bother about what others go through when they dump u in such a childish manner...People must have the basic empathy that if u r not into long term stuff or have not yet decided then don't make the other person drool over you...People must also see that its not always about 'them'...their actions do affect other people..so be very careful in what u do or what u speak and even in what u act!</h1>
<p>P.S- Love is a trial and error method as someone said to me..but the trial must not harm the person mentally..bcoz HONESTY WITHOUT COMPASSION IS CRUELTY...and error must not scar a person bcoz some scars leave permanent marks on the soul...</p>
