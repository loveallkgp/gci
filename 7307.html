<p>I feel bad when a certain friend of mine chats with other gay people on fb and what'sapp, though we are not in relationship.He said he was emotionally attached to me and thought of proposing me but didn't because he doesn't want long distance relationship since we are not in the same town anymore.This has led to an unhealthy relationship because I get hurt and verbally attack n offend him whenever I catch him chatting with others or whenever he is online in his fake ac. he doesn't talk with me like the way he used to. As a result I m always worried, in pain and hence cannot concentrate on studies. can anyone suggest what to do?</p>
<h1>GCI- U kick someone, splash mud on him, make derogatory comments and then ask him to be friends with u....legitimate enough?!</h1>
<p>Stop thinking about him for the tym being and think for ur own shit called life....Life will rebound u with one day if that is necessary....otherwise there is always another chance of re building things with someone else and if u want life to be free of drama then STOP BEING MELODRAMATIC. Its ok to lose people in life, it shows that we have outgrown something.</p>
