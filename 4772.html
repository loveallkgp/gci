<p>Hey, #GCI you people are doing a great job it's a bit like angels. I wanna share a l'il fairytale of mine a 'fairytale' cause I love fairy tales since I was ittu shaa because they always had a happy ending mine is kinda in between the two emotions #happy n #sad but it's like I'm kinda satisfied. It's about me n my love, I love him this no this ...... much the thing is I could find no words to even tell uh ppl even an estimation of it he's like a beautiful dream a dream from which I never wish to come out :-! but after all it's just kinda a dream n couldn't stay as a reality. I met him on Facebook we talked n talked for hours n then the other day I realized he is the one I fell for him so hard that I hit the floor but it wouldn't pain at all so I proposed him firstly he denied but I knew may be he'll say the three magical words back I was crying n he said it. :') He was 20 n I was 16 so I taught like gosh he would never love me so I showed him a picture of a guy who had a similar age n pretend to be him all the time. It did hurt a lot always hiding the truth but I was so damn scared to loose him it was kinda the biggest fear for me ever one day he questioned me if I am lying I said I ain't n then again he asked me I again said the same thing this was the biggest mistake made by me ever I regret it a lot n I cried for nights n one day I did tell him the truth n lost him but it was acceptable cause it was just not me it was not it was that virtual person I made him fall for I know I'm a jerk but all I am is sorry n I still hear his voice the way he used to talk over the phone n everything I miss it I miss it a lot. But I deserved it. The so called 'fairytale' ends here n I got to know one thing which means a lot to me a lot it is that love never knows any age, differences, gender or anything n it's one of the best things I know, so please don't lie to the ppl uh love ever uh might just loose it all.</p>
