<p>Hi, there's a guy in my office gym and i have a huge crush on him. His name is V<strong><em>*</em> J</strong>* He is well built and a have great body and very attractive. I checked his FB profile and i see he has some gay friends added in it. Even i saw him talk to some people and through his little bit hand gestures i think he might be. I just want to be his friends and not looking for sex or anything, just wanted to have someone to talk to and share feelings. I dont know how should i contact him and how will i know if he is gay or not. His one of friends in FB have posted how he liked "Kapoor &amp; Sons" movie and he has also commented on that, how he felt the same. Should i message him from fake profile or how can i now if he is gay. He has noticed me sometimes but dont know how to talk to him as i m usually quiet and don't interact much in gym. He seems to be popular one. Guys please help.</p>
<h1>GCIL- This is one of those posts where I get clueless literally on what are gaymen upto these days!</h1>
