<p>I never understand the link between molestation and sexuality, whenever i heard find people changed their sexual preference having history of child abused. does the impact occur so much hard,changed the whole persona of person.i agree people born with sexuality ,but what about people who got sexually abused later become interested in same sex. i find many people started this life after being abused in childhood by relatives ,friends etc.it somewhat alter the mindset of child about sex perception. being molested as child is worst ever experience of any child. it ends the innocence and immaculate nature of child.brings anger,
depression and hatred for all.</p>
<h1>GCI- It is researched as one of the factors to like gaysex &amp; NOT  turn homosexual..i hope now ur confusion is clear!</h1>
<p>There is just a single link to sexuality and that is being born like that...still after working on genes through genetics and working on epigenetics no firm answer has been derived as to y a person is gay...just the way why a foetus is either a boy or a girl or a trans etc...The scientists just know that the person has a specific biological sex but not about specific orientation or sexuality!!!</p>
