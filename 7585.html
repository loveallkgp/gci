<p>So i'm a good looking 23 yrs old guy. I like gay porn. I really enjoy it and wish I had a partner. I have been on fb with this fake account for quite some time, talked to several people, exchanged phone numbers. But when it comes to sharing my pic, I totally freak out. I end the conversation there only. I really fear what if someone finds out. I'm a virgin and want to fell the pleasure of gay sex that I have always craved for. I feel scared of going to places for random hookups. I don't find the people here trustworthy. What if I get stuck?  What if I'm cheated? All these thoughts cross my mind and I end up deactivating my account everytime. I want to know dont you guys feel scared going to an unknown place for an unknown person?</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, if you are going for just a hookup, then do not be scared for getting cheated on. Just fuck and forget. Loyalty, when you are just having sex, doesn't matter. You can be friends with benefits with someone and be done with it.</h1>
<p>As far as other matters are concerned, then tread carefully. The type of laws and the type of moral policing that are happening in India right now, will harm you if you are not careful enough. Try to talk to someone beforehand, gain their trust and then move forward.</p>
