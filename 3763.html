<p>Hi,
I am the confessor of the confession #3731</p>
<p>Thank you admin for supporting me. It means a  lot to me. I never had this kind of support.</p>
<p>For all those who prayed for my recovery, Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>I take my critics positively because I know it was a mistake to hurt myself. I have learned from my mistake.
 Confessor of #3736, your words were kind and soothing.</p>
<p>Confessor of #3738, I loved him and love doesn't seek revenge. He stooped low but I don't think that hurting him will heal my wounds.
Now that I think of it I feel it was all my mistake to slash my wrist and jump. He had not asked me to do it. I did it in a moment of anger and pain. 
As admin said in his post, I had nowhere to look for support. I could  not tell anyone what I was feeling. I felt choked and strangulated by my feelings.
After all I failed to judge him so I cannot think of revenge now.The way he treated me was his Karma and the way I reacted was mine.
Thanks for the strong words.</p>
<p>Some thought my story was hypothetical, even I wish it was just a bad dream but when I open my eyes in the morning and struggle to walk, reality hits me hard.
 As of now I am working from home and preparing for GMAT. Please wish me luck.</p>
<p>All those who have asked me to message them as friends, thanks a lot. I will get in touch with you all shortly. I hope to make good friends.
I am so overwhelmed by the comments. Thank you guys for understanding me and showing your love and support.</p>
<h1>GcI : best of luck . do well :D</h1>
