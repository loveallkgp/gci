<p>i am not a gay and i have a girlfriend and we deeply love each other but stil i clicked on this page's link to confess something. when i was 15, i got two proposals from two different guys to have sex with them. that 1st guy was my friend but i refused and told him that i am deeply in love with a girl and i am not a gay ,and second was from my cousin brother, at that time i couldn't propose to that girl whom i loved a lot and i was depressed and i thought it's better that i should have sex with my cousin brother. finally we were together in room and he closed the door, he unzipped my pants and this made me feel guilty. so i refused before we can have sex. my brother was dissapointed but i told him 'i just can't do so'. next day i proposed my girlfriend and then i turned 17, i had my first sex with her. althrough i am not homophobic and i am broad minded person and i think no law should ban homosexuality in our country.</p>
