<h1>GCI- There is your reality on one side, and there is the "culture" on the other side. In the middle, you stand with your reality that is a part of you, with culture surrounding you that was made by the people of the old age who mostly knew nothing about human psychology and stuff. It's your decision whatever you want to do with your family.</h1>
<p>As far as your medical future is considered, choose wherever you would be happy. Think about yourself for a while without considering the people around you. If you are happy, then you can make others happy.</p>
