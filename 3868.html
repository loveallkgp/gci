<p>Hey, Prateek heatbreaker this side. Yesterday i broke up my one year so called best friendship with a guy from North east (in this gay ID) because he thinks Delhi people aren't good. So here's something i wanna clear out to all fuckin assholes over here who thinks Delhi is unsafe 4 humans. Here i go:</p>
<p>I'm going to go out on a limb and say the unthinkable - IT ISN'T. And if it is, then India is, as a whole. Yes, I'm a guy and I belong to Delhi. I may never know what it is to be a woman walking in the streets being glared at everywhere I go. I understand that, I sympathize. But given those limitations, do hear me out.
This is more or less the situation of rapes in our country.
Wait, what? Delhi has fewer rapes than Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chattisgarh, Bihar and West Bengal? Unbelievable? Believe it.
Yes, Delhi is just a city state and the geographical area isn't much? Well, open your eyes - Delhi has a population equivalent to England in a much smaller geographical area with a severely outnumbered police workforce - yet England has a slightly higher incidence of rapes.
Another fact? US has more rape cases than India.. approximately 4 TIMES MORE, at around 80,000 with a much smaller population over a larger geographical area.
Source for these facts? The american chapter of Wall Street Journal.
Facts aside, the issue of rape being tied to a country or a city is something to be ashamed of, and to be an upcoming global superpower with the 2nd highest number of rape cases, at least among developing and developed nations, speaks poorly of our competence in even basic human rights.
More than that, I hate how Bangalore/Mumbai/Kolkata/fill-in-your-random-metropolis citizens think that they are entitled to the 'India's best city' crown - this isn't a contest, and no one is getting brownie points for being popular - the issue is grave and 2,000 rapes less statistically reduces your chances of getting raped by an infinitesimal amount.
The media is also to blame - particularly because they sensationalize the gang rape of a modern Indian woman in Delhi, calling it the rape capital but chose to ignore the gang rapes of rural women in villages and small towns because they grab less eyeballs. Yes, it is disturbing that a city where the country's policy making takes place has such a serious issue, but is the issue any less grave in a village than in Delhi? Women are unsafe practically everywhere in India.
Until and unless more and more areas eradicate this heinous crime - a good example seems to be #Chandigarh, a union territory like Delhi - I urge people to not get complacent and do whatever they can in their limited capacities to raise awareness and work towards changing laws, allocating more police personnel, making punishments for rape and molestation more severe, and whatever else can be done to mitigate this.
I can't really say much about the fact that you encountered vile rogues in my city more than in Mumbai, but I'm sure if the situation is bad like the map shows, there are bad areas for women to be hanging around even in Mumbai, or any other city for that matter.</p>
<p>"The most unsafe city in India is #Gwalior" - FastCheck via NCRB</p>
<p>Also i would like to quote one more thing that the guy with whom i maintained friendly relationship for more than a year visited my house 2 months back, stayed with me. I didn't touched him without his permission, didn't raped or butt fucked him. Also he gave me opportunity to do anything with him but sorry i'm not that kind of person. And i am proud Delhitie but before that i am a proud Indian. B)</p>
<p>This World is full of Racist, good, Bad, Assholes and other creepy and nice aliens, its all about how you see people.</p>
