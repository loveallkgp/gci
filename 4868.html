<p>I m very cute mbbs student.yes my life became a hell for me, bcoz I was mentally girl from my childhood.I never wanted to be a gay bcoz I was girl inside.I faced so much behaviour issues from my childhood,tried my level best to get a good medical college.But I m very depressed.My future is very dark.I looked very cute but it doesn't make any sense.I compromised in every aspect.I wanted to change d sex as treatment r available but I know my career will end,indians thinking will make me die.Sometyms I think why I m studying..it was better to suicide.I remember I liked many boys of my class but never said them,it hurts.But still there is hope somewhere that may be any handsome will come in my life anytime and make me happy. As a medical student,i know LGBT is not any issue....but social stigma is very deep and changing sex in india is just like cutting fingers own....May be I m 2day will not be 2morrow...pray for all of u for ur Happy future...tc</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, I know how troubling it can be for you when you don't know what to do. But don't feel let down because of the society. Do not let this society be the end of you. You life is certainly not worth this. Your future is in your hands and you can either make it good or destroy it. Finish your education, get a nice placement and change your sex. If you have any doubts then see the life of Gazal whose life story was showed in Satyamev Jayate.</h1>
