<p>the person i loved left me and went somewhere far away-</p>
<p>me and my friend, i loved him but i never wanted to express my love for him, i didn't want to lose him, i knew that if i proposed , he will leave me. he belonged from the family of highly educated people, some had done PHDs in different subjects and they belonged to upper middle class family, so you can guess there was lot of pressure on son to get high marks too, he was intelligent and he taught me too, his family-all of them studied from top universities wanted to take 1 stop forward, when we both passed our 12 Th boards, his father finally decided to send him one of the top universities, it was not in our city,town or country but in another country , in USA, they wanted to send him one of the top 10 universities of world- Harvard university. he was amazed,excited...he told me that because of his good percentage and his father had some connections, he will soon be getting admissions there, i was heartbroken, i didn't want to lose him but he had to go...and i never proposed him.</p>
<p>last day we spent few hours together and i went with his parents to drop him at airport, i waited there and i could see, that plane struggling to go higher and higher, he went away, so you know i cold never propose him and i hope he is doing well, love is a very strange thing, especially if you fall in love in wrong time...</p>
<h1>Viv- Welp, that sounds stressful.</h1>
