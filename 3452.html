<h1>GCI- There isn't any other option to go for if you don't want to come out. Of course, you can always say that you small pee pee or you pee pee doesn't stands up but with mother that kind of talk will be awkward. You don't want to marry and you don't want to come out either. These two don't go with each other.</h1>
