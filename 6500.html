<p>hi guys this is my second post in this page.. well its not a confession just wanted to share an embarrassing incident a year and a half ago I was caught by my elder brother while i was checking out a block in tumble full of nude men pictures..I found by brothers PC was unlocked that day and he was away ...I browsed some blocks in tumble and the left the PC just as it was before my brother returned.. I was so silly back then ( i still am) I didn't clear the browsing history.. there was nobody in the house that evening.. my brother after he figuring out what I was doing with his PC ...he shouted out loudly and angrily "r u Gay!!!" I didn't reply I was so scared ... it was clear that certainly did not like it.. I could dare speaking to him for nearly a month .. months passed not he behaves normally with me ..but am sure he dislikes me .. any way ...I at least came out to one of my family member.. when I look back now ..this incident is rather funny than embarrassing.. many of us here have got such incidents happening in there life..</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm..even when i post stuff on GCI at times my brother has seen it occasionally but never asked me as such...I assume he may be thinking of his 'ryt' time to ask I guess!</h1>
