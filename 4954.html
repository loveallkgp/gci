<p>Hi this is not really a confession. My bf n I have been together in a monogamous relationship for the past one month. We still haven't had anal sex. He says he hasn't received anal ever, while I have barebacked with two persons previously. But now I'm very careful. I don't think I have any STDs. Do u think we should have anal without condoms? Or condoms for sure? We trust each other. I see sometimes that people get offended when I use condoms because it is often seen as a sign of not trusting ur partner. What r ur views? Plus, what are ur favourite lubes?? All of them are so expensive. Ciao</p>
<h1>GCI- Yes, get tested for STDs and do use a condom. It should never be seen as offending. It's for your own health. But if you wanna do bareback, get tested, make sure and then do it.</h1>
