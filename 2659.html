<p>21yr male bi dehradun
hey everyone
i have a senior at my work who is 23yr old....he is very cute and have a muscled body.....we have a very gr8 understanding as we both belong to north...we spend a lot of time in office as well as in hostel (we both live in same hostel but different room)....we share a lot of things like family matters,, jokes, work n many more day to day stuffs.......i startd liking him and one day drank a lot and before we got to sleep i kissed him on cheeks saying gud nite sir ji and he kissed me back.....from that day i intensionally kiss him after drinking and he accepts it but never kissed me back.....everything is going smoothly.....now what should i do....i have a strong feelings for him but i m scared becoz my job will be ar stake.....</p>
<h1>GCI- If he is not returning the kisses back, then its way too clear that he is not gay. He doesn't make any advances, he doesn't give you any signs. So, you gots to keep your feelings and friendship totally platonic. Your answer lies in your confession only, in your last line.</h1>
