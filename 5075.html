<p>Hi ppl. I'm from Pakistan and i'm 15 years old.
I'm totally confused. First of all mujhe yei nae samajh aarai that main gay hoon ya straight?
Main ne aik dafa apne classfellow k sath sex kia tha and whenever i think about girls mujhe aisa lagta hy i shouldn't do this with any girl before i get married.
And secondly mujhe larkian bhi achi lagti hen un k looks se per kabhi bhi unhe gandi nazar se dekhne ka dil nai karta
Aor agar main gay hoon to kya gay kisi larki se shadi ni kar skta?
Or agar karle to can they give birth to baby?</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all many people have this wrong notion that if a person is gay, they can't reproduce. Being gay means liking the same sex. You still have the male anatomy with functioning organs. So a gay person can reproduce too if it comes to that.</h1>
<p>Now, you are just 15 right now. You may have a series of emotions that will make you confused about yourself. But what appears to me is that you are neither a heterosexual not bisexual. I also like girls but I cannot have the thing with them that I can have with boys. </p>
<p>Getting married to a girl is your personal choice but it's not right for a gay man. I am saying this generally and not specifically for you. It would actually be very wrong with the girl with whom the gay man would marry.</p>
