<p>Last night while leaving from sunburn I saw a bunch of guys who were all sitting in a group and I saw some of the kissing so I guess they wer gay. I wish I could have gone and said hi to em and made a conversation with em but I was with My friends in the car and they to saw em and they started to make fun of em n I actully stood unfortunately the guys and told my friends to stop it and asked em wether they would have laughed the same way if they saw a straight couple n no one said anything. This is the kinda hypocritical world we live in.</p>
<h1>GCI- They were kissing and you still think they were gay? But it's a good thing you shut them up. They had it coming.</h1>
