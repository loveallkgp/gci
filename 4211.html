<p>1)Gay couples can never make a family for their kids, that is because a family essentially means FATHER AND MOTHER I LOVE YOU.</p>
<p>2)I dont understand why the gay men have the gay prides? Do the straight men go around making public their sexuality? No. Then what gives the gay men the cause for doing so? It has many implications such as the traffic jams, the road blocks and inconvenience to the public. </p>
<h1>GCI- Umm gay people can have families too, no one asks for someone's consent for it. Duh! Actually gay couples make better parents than most of the hetero families. They think beyond boundaries and all that matters for them is mutual love.</h1>
<p>2) Oh straight people do make a show of their sexuality. Remember the big fat indian weddings? You say its culture, I say it is a sheer display of your sexuality and you are letting people know that you are straights by having such big baraat processions, making bride and groom sit infront of everyone, having tonnes of functions for them. You will say it is about happiness. I say, it can be. Now step into our shoes. For the community people who have been oppressed, bullied, driven to suicide, some actually got killed, sexually abused, raped, having a gay pride is a display of confidence and acceptance(which we do not seek from people like you) for those people who have risen like a phoenix from the ashes. And honey, gay prides happen once a year in a particular city. Do you complaint to God during rainy season? Do you complain to the government when there are roadblocks during their processions? I guess not. Why the STUPAD hypocrisy?</p>
<p>HATERS BACK OFF!</p>
