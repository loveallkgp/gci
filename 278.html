<p>I m confessing it after 1 year cuz it happened right on this day in 2013. I met a guy on fb and we started chatting and meeting in person. We also talked on phone for hours. He was a very sweet guy and loved talking. On propose day last year we went to a mall and enjoyed too much over there. After we got back he called me and proposed to me. I was shocked but I denied him. The reason would be that I only wanted to have sex dates and I couldnt go romantic. I let him down by saying a lie that i wasnt ready but he still remained my friend. Our friendship went very good until the month of august when he stopped all contacts. I got in a relationship after that and it ended quite soon. This had me thinking that very first guy could have been the lucky one for me. I still miss him and wish him luck wherever he is. I got what I deserve. Happy valentines week admins and everyone.</p>
