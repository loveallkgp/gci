<p>I am 26 gay and my bf is 24 bi. We love each other a lot. Its like a perfect relation for 2 yrs and we have stayed loyal. However he keeps telling me we dont have a future. He wants to stay in relation till 25 yrs only. Then he wants to marry and leave gay life. He feels being bi he doesnt have to stay single and risk being outed. I dont know what to do. I cant bear to lose him but staying in a relation which I know will end is also a pain.</p>
<h1>GCI- What the damn hell? He feels like that a relationship can be confined in a time limit? He is playing safe and that's not because he is bisexual but many times gay people do that as well. If you leave him or he leaves you later, either way you will be hurt. If he thinks that he has to leave you then there is no use to be in a relationship.</h1>
