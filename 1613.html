<p>This confession is to GOD. so GOD pls hear my words. Oh! God, U are partial; Too partial:( All priests say GOD treats everyone equal and wont discriminate . But i totally disagree with them. hey, u Mr. GOD!, keep listening ah..?? U made us GAY. U made us unique. But do u ever looked into our problems ??Now common tell me wats the idea behind u to create us??? I am sure u created us for time pass :( Everyone say marriages are made in heaven; U already have paired everyone's life partner :P :P:(. U made other people (heteros) to get there life partner either by hook or crook i.e either by arranged marriage or love marriage. At d end every hetero wil have der life partner. Oye! GOD , dont go away, i need to tell u more. :P :( But wat abt us, gays ah?? First of all u made us a minority group (too mean of u :( ) and all here are not so lucky enough to get der gay partner:( . Why did u made gays ,unlucky fellows on earth?? U shuld have created our life partners as u did in heteros...U shuld have made us to meet our life partners somewhere in our life course. U shuld have taken measures to see tat all gays get their partners and get settled. But u playing hide and seek game with us ah??? See now , coz of not getting any gay partners many gays are forced to lead a silent life. Arent u being partial Mr.GOD. :( Seriously, i Hate u for dis. :(:( but pls dont mind. Sorry for hating u :( :( Coz whole world reject us, Atleast we need u to accept us. Oh... GOD, pls try to understand our situation. Atleast next time, in next yuga, when u start creating new models, pls consider my valuable tips and ensure tat ur children either gay or hetero , wil be happy with der life partners:):) #thanks 4 listening # Do keep blessing us #GOD. We all Love U. :* :D :)</p>
