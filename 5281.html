<p>Hi I was going from Calcutta to Lal Kuan on 6th through Lal Kuan express. In our compartment there were 4 friends, perhaps college friends or something else. Uske pehele let me say something, I have this quality that whenever I meet a person Gay or straight or whatever I go up to the person and straightforwardly tell him about my emotion. Kyun ki I feel agar mai Nahi bola to baad me I'll repent that why didn't I say so and later on I'll always think of that only ki why didn't I tell him!
Now here was one guy of the 4 on whom I have a crush but pata Nahi how I couldn't come up with that courage to speak to him about my emotion. They got down at Lucknow and now mujhe upsos ho raha hai ki why haven't I told him. Iske pehele bohot baar huya hai aisa but everytime I go up to the person and say about my feelings in a normal way. But this time I couldn't. That's all! </p>
<h1>GCI- Ummm okayyy.. -_-</h1>
