Hi guys,
many people and friends asked me about "What is true love or i mean love?"
according to me true love nd love is one and the same thing. Everybody weather he was or is in a relationship or not have experienced it but we failed to recoganise it.
Love is same that you do with your mother father. your family or anyone for whom you care. Love was never related to lust and won't be in the coming time and i am sure for that. Love is an innocent feeling when we have nothing evil about the someone. When we care for that person.
Just ask urself can you guys think ill about ur mother...never thts what the love is. Love is beyond the physical boundaries. Its the only thread that connet god with ur soul. its is very pure and divine. Just think when we cheat someone in the name of love how big will be the sin is. Understand love not run for being committed and eager to bounce on bed. You can sleep with anyone, but lucky people who get chance to stand with their loved ones at difficult time.</p>
