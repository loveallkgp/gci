<p>I have a friend of mine from mumbai ...we started talking on fb n became good friends(only friendship wala intention) anyways i am from a different state
.
slowly he told me that i m his bestfriend as he shares every secret with me...he couldnt move further as i m committed to my bf
.
oku so my problem ..
one day i asked him about his virginity n he said that he had a best friend with whom he had sex many times ...usko yaad v nai kitna baar...later on his bstfrn changed his city n their contact was les
.
next day i asked him will u ever tell about ur sexuality to family...he said no ...he will marry a girl like every typical guy does n all those reasons that his family is narrow minded n all
.
i said him u know u r gay n doing this will ruin the gals lyf n all ... i said him to block me coz i dont like fake people who cant accept reality
.
after that day i stopped talking with him coz my inner self did not allow me to do so :/ admin maine sahi kia na??
.
i mean i m younger than him i never had sex with a guy ..still i m in long distance relation...i know i m gay n one day i will tell my family after getting job
n at present my best friends also know this
.
i stopped talking with him is this right?
a person who cannot b true to himself cannot be true to me na
.
n usne to nam ka bstfrn bola i stopped talking n he did not try to contact me even
.
well i m happy with my decision :D</p>
<h1>admin :* kabhi kabhi apne lyf k bhi kuch secrets n inspiration confess karo bhai :P kya karu jab sachcha pyar ho jata hai fir har ek ladka ko bhai k najar se dekhta hu hehe</h1>
<p>.</p>
<h1>i m 17 bihar</h1>
<h1>GCI- Family can be narrow minded but that is not an excuse for hiding behind the veil. He is just playing safe. Side by side he will cheat on his wife. The typical scared gay guy who has different personalities. I wouldn't say that you did exactly the right thing by break contacts with him, but atleast you put the right point. If he had any receptive brain, he would have listened it. Moreover, looking at the fact that he didn't raise much voice after you stopped your communication, speaks for the fact that he was never true to you either. So feel contended and happy for yourself.</h1>
