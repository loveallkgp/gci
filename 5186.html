<p>Hey guys I have a kind of complex when it comes to sex. I enjoy watching and fantasising everything in sex but when I get to do it in real with someone I freak out. I have a huge crush on a guy I know since 3yrs, I think I can do it only with him. but that's never gonna happen. I tried imaging him while I'm with someone else, that worked to get hard but never enjoyed it fully. Even while watching porn I shag only to those where the guy looks similar to him. Is it a phase or am I stuck forever..?</p>
<h1>GCI- Freak out in what sense? You scream? You start getting nervous? Your dick goes limp? In either case, just know that the other person is not the serial killer. Talk with a person for some days, establish trust and then do stuff with him if you are okay. Considering a person with psychology like yours, you cannot just go and have sex with someone randomly. What you need is a communication with other people.</h1>
