<p>Well admin yar
M having the same problem yar there is a guy who turned 23 today i love him unconditionally even i proposed him may be a week ago but as per he, he has not forgotten his old boyfriend yet but hes trying to. He asked me to give him some time but then he said that he doesn't want any relationship as he have to pay attention on his office stuff. Earlier we had clashes argues regarding this and we are having no contact with each other i told him that i wanna move on i wanna overwhelm with him though its quite difficult for me as m crazy about him. I asked him to not to contact me even i won't call him either. m i wrong?</p>
<p>Kya mene sahi kia cuz me samajhta hu k me uske layak hi nhi hu
Nd plz admin you will not post dis query a kind request to you</p>
<p>Many of my friends asked me to move on but i can hardly forget him he stay in my mind for the whole day whole nights i don't wanna lose him cuz aisa wala luv bar bar nhi hota i wish we had another time to know each other to fall in luv with each other he adore me yar but i don't know why since i proposed him he started ignoring me everything was good but i was unable to tolerate his ignorance i blocked him without informing him about he got angry on this and he blocked me too and this is how we lost contact with each other</p>
<p>Me itana confuse hu k me usey bhulana chahta hu par usey pyar karta hu to usey pana bhi chahta hu i really don't know how do i get his attention or make him luv me too we never met as he lives in gujarat and i in maharashtra</p>
<p>Ap bataiye na bro what shall i do </p>
<h1>GCI- See, it works like this, when two people like each other and they both make moves to make something out of it, it turns out to be something good. But when the feelings are one sided, and the person who makes some moves, it turns out to be a pretty creepy scenario for the guy who has no feelings. Moreover you never start a fling with proposing. Sometimes feelings are hard to contain but you really have to be sure that this is THE GUY for you. You let the feelings develop and they have to be mutual. You just cannot dump your feelings on someone and say, "ye le mera halwa aur kha le." Banda to bhaage ga hi fir.</h1>
<p>Anyways, you cannot force him to understand you and come back. More you press on it, farther away he is gonna run. If he likes you, misses you, he will come back.</p>
