<p>Thank you guys..kya comments he I mean I'm scared. Some of you think I'm fool. Me ek hostal me tha jha ek bada sa hull hota tha and after 10:30 there was no light even if you want to go washroom you can not find your slippers. Or sex ( I'm not saying rape alright ) sirf 3bar hua.. or wo kab hoga iska koi schedule nhi tha ki me taiyar rehta ki koi aane wala he..and that was not a pleasurable moment for me me I was seriously suffering. And if I shout and anyone saw us..my god Mera jina mushkil ho jata or ye bat wahi samjh sakta he jo ek typical christian hostal me rha hu..jha tumhari koi nhi sunta bus rules fallow karte jao... I'm not interested in being gay... I feel ashamed on me when I remember that time. Ghiiiiin aatai he....</p>
<h1>GCI- Even I was surprised at some comments on confession 5173. When I make a sarcastic or a funny comment on a weird confession, you all jump on me and say "oh look at admin, he is so rude and has no sense and posts shit confessions." You know what? You all have no right to say that anymore. Atleast I got sense of being sensitive on a sensitive confession. Even if a confession sounds fake to you, I repeat this that a situation can be a truth in someone else's life. Try using some brains for once.</h1>
<p>To the confessor, don't let some negative viewpoints turn you down. People generally don't understand or do not want to understand. What they cannot understand, they say that it's fake. People are not ready to think out of their shells. And then they expect other people to understand them.</p>
