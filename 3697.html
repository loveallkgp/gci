<p>'Homosexuality' and 'Feminine Behaviour'
Is their any link??</p>
<p>To answer it, we have to point out following facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a lot to learn about homosexuality especially in India. People dont know anything about it. Whenever the word 'gay' is pronounced, people think of 'transgenders', 'eunuchs' etc, which is pathetic!</li>
</ol>
<p>From the earlier generations, people believe in love between boy and girl, marriage between man and woman, sex between opposite
genders...They think homosexuality is not natural and thats why they put in their mind that if he likes men, he cant be a man...he is girlish,
immature or incomplete.
Why do u think that homosexuality is not natural??
Gay men are a part of this nature (they are not aliens) and so homosexuality too..
So, if a person likes a man, it is a girl or girlish...that is a stupid statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sexual orientation comes from our genes (which has been scientifically proved) while behaviour comes from the environment in which u r grown up. There are many guys who look girlish, behave girlish...but their orientation is straight. Take the example of Justin Bieber, and many others.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of men who are more manly than straight ones...lots of celebrities came out recently,,,did anyone predict their orientation before??...no..because thier behaviour is normal, Neil patrick harris, ian thorpe...(countless).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many men are forced to behave in feminine manner. Society makes him believe that opposite genders attract. And if u are attracted to men, u are not a man and from here his confidence is lost and he goes into deep depression and confusion. And he starts believing there is a girl in his personallity . And this misconception ruins his life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some gays have a psychological misunderstanding that if he has to seduce any guy, he would have to behave girlish. So, they come out of their real behaviour and starts acting like a girl. They do not do so knowingly, the 'opp attract' tag forces him to do so. They should keep in their mind that "same genders attract and its natural". You need not be a girl to attract a guy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>5 Gay love is between two men, not between a man and a eunuch or transgender or girlish guys.</p>
<p>So....ignore the fucking homphobes....be confident...dont get pressurized from society.....work hard.....build a strong personallity in you.....be what you are and.........
................do justice to your soul.</p>
