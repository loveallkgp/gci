<p>Hey Guys and #GCIAdmin , i'm 19 years old and live in Delhi. I have something to say and have a question too. First of all , Every Muslim I know says that being gay is a choice, which is just not TRUE. I'm attracted to men the same way a straight man is attracted to women, and this was never a conscious choice on my part. It's like asking a straight man to suddenly start liking men: Is he going to be able to that? No.</p>
<p>I've accepted the fact that I'm gay, however it's now making me question my religion. What i have heard that Allah forbids homosexuality. BUT If Allah forbids homosexuality, then why does he allow people to be born gay? Recently, I went to the Mosque and asked MY IMAM. HE SAYS THAT BEING GAY ISN'T ACTUALLY A SIN IN AND OF ITSELF, BUT IT IS A SIN IF YOU PERFORM ANY HOMOSEXUAL ACTS. He told me I should just marry a girl, but is that fair to any girl that I marry? Am I meant to live without a partner for the rest of my life? Is that what Allah wants for me?</p>
<p>I've recently read the Qur'an in English and the things that happen to gay people after death has put me into depression. I just don't see the point in praying anymore when I know I'm going to burn in hell for something Allah has burdened me with.</p>
<p>So my question is, "If the God or Allah forbids homosexuality, then why does He allow people to be born gay?" It's like we're guaranteed to go to hell as soon as we're born.I am scared and not sure where to turn. Any help?</p>
<h1>GCI- Those who say that being gay is a choice are finding an excuse for getting changed at a later stage of life which is not possible. Before you ask anyone what you should do, ask yourself what you want. At the same time, think whether someone will change his lifestyle according to your terms or not. If we talk about religious stuff, I don't think anyone in this world is pure enough to have a direct correction with God.</h1>
<p>Let's talk about Prophets, bet it of any religion. We have so many babas, priests, maulvis etc, and we know that they preach the word of God in this era. People go to them for answers. Think about the same scenario around 2000 or 3000 years back. If someone sane minded tried to teach people some stuff, people projected him as some Godly man and started worshiping him. That's how each and every religion came into existence and all the religious texts were written according to that era, which are somewhat invalid in the present era. </p>
<p>Also, heaven and hell are itself on earth. It is how we make our lives to be. Do not seek for validation from anyone for your existence. You are not harming anyone so you are not doing anything wrong. If you are religious then just believe that love and kindness are the only thing that matters in God's eyes. God bless you.</p>
