<h1>19 #Haridwar</h1>
<p>Today on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan me and my family went to our bua's(father's sister) home. I was meeting all of them after a long period say a year or two. We had amazing day with them full of joy, laughs, colors and rakhis.</p>
<p>While we all were making conversations with each other, I had an interesting talk with my fufaji (bua's husband) and felt a kind of zing in my heart. We exchanged our sight a lot many times and whenever we looked at each other passed smiles, I know it's normal but at that very moment I found him very attractive and certainly discovered my liking for him.</p>
<p>Though he's married and have a child but still he's very fit, attractive and handsome.</p>
<p>Many people may find it very weird and completely trash but this is all what my heart felt.</p>
<p>I even know it's just my infatuation but certainly I developed it.</p>
<p>Is this whole thing right ?</p>
<p>P.S. I like mature man</p>
<h1>GCI- Its kinda weird to be honest. It would be better if you don't take a step forward. Rest is all upon you.</h1>
