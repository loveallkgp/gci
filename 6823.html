<p>admin...actually..there is problem of someone which he told me so i thought to ask u and give him the best answer..
actually there is a frnd of mine who is totaly strght.. and had two gf's in the past and currntly with the 3rd one..with two of them he had done sex too....and he was never ever attracted towards boys.. bt the problms starts 4m here that they shifted to another localty and there is boy who is 28/29 yr old..and my frnd is just cnt getng ovr him..
means evrytime he talks bout him,thinks bout</p>
<p>him and so on...
he never liked any boy ever..
i am also shockd by this..
now u tell me what u think about it.</p>
<h1>GCI- I cannot understand about what does he thinks about him? Is there an infatuation, obsession, just a friendly feeling or he just wants to kill him? I cannot make judgments until I know more, neither can you.</h1>
