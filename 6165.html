<h1>GCI- Honey, don't blame the genes or God, blame the others who make fun of you. For weight gaining, make a chart of how many calories you are taking in a day and triple it up. You need good quality calories free from trans fat and cholesterol, lots of carbs and proteins. BTW, have some protein intake only when you are working out otherwise they can be problematic. Otherwise you can hire a personal trainer in the gym who can help you up with everything.</h1>
