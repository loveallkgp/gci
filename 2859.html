<p>I have a very irritating habit, one which i'm not proud of. I love exhibiting myself to my friends. I usually open one of the buttons of my shirt and go with my friends. When someone points it out, i act embarrassed and button up. I also wear my pants very low and then stretch and bend so that the people around me tell me that my undies are visible. Then i pull up my pants. I'm always waiting for one my friends(boys) to have a wardrobe malfunction. I love wearing sagging pants. If my friend has his top shirt button open, i always try to open the second one saying that "it's very hot today right? ". I sometimes tell my friends that an insect has got into his shirt, then most often they go to the restroom and remove it to check. I go along to "help" them. I'm really sorry for my behavior.  Is there anyone else like me or am i the only freak?</p>
<h1>GCI : see having shirt open is not crime but you shall see your occasion , profession when having it open . Eg : in school/college while class don't keep button open ( its called indecent expose ) , in interview or proffesional work or office you can't . in parties you can open as many buttons , in a fashion college you can open button , on beach or public place you can open one or two buttons open .</h1>
<p>but about saggy pants and showing underwear .. darling its not fashion its seriously felony . wearing you pants so low that people can see your butt easily was trend in prisons . in prisons many men who were bottoms when needed sex would hang around sagging their pants to give sign that they want top guy . </p>
<p>so big no no to your underwear showing saggy pants .</p>
