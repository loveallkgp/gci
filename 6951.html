<p>love is d most beautifull thing n at d sametime most painfull thing  . 
I was in intimate relation wth my best friend for 2 yrs n i was never involved wth a guy before  but after sometime i realised  he was more close to another friend n lying to me . I  never emagined  myself wth any guy  n trusted him more than aything . he choose his frnd over me this really hurt me  bcause i was deeply in love n dis made me so depreesed   this all happnd 1 yr ago But i still love him n whenever i see it acts as catalyst to enhance my frustation ....people says time heals but  how many yrs i wll suffer  , i m despratly watng for that time.i  even consult a psycatrist but no improovemnt to my illness . Earliear i was a nice person  evryone used to enjoy my company but Now i m totally a different  person .
one more thing one who feels d pain can only understand d pain!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Life does gives you lemons but is it necessary to take a bag of them for the rest of your life? Throw them away, stomp on them, let flies sit on the juice and enjoy it. You be like a pigeon, strut away like you don't give a fuck. Try to socialize more with other people and don't isolate yourself.</h1>
