<p>I'm in love with my friend who is my neighbour and classmate. We live in a same building. So I drop by everytime he needs me. Literally every single time when he needs me. Sometimes I cook for him or invite him, even his laundry. He lives in such a mess that I have to clean it up for him. He says he doesnt have a girlfriend but talk hours on the phone. I feel uneasy when he do that. 2 nights earlier we slept together and suddenly he left and went to the another room. I dont know what happend but now he is acting all weird . I asked him if he's okay but he says its nothing. I have stopped going his place and meet him less often. He also started skipping class. I dont know if I should check on him or not. Im worried what should I do?</p>
<h1>GCI- I am still unable to understand it all. You are jealous of him talking to someone, you do stuff for him, you 2 didn't do anything on that night and still he feels awkward about it? Are you sure it was about that night only? BTW, ask him what's going on. It might not be something related to you. And please stop being his personal maid. Damn! People can be so wifey at times!</h1>
