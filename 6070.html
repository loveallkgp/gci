<p>I was 13 when i was raped....several times a day, for 6 months..... marks of burning cigarettes are still alive.
Had a two year long relation but ended with his death in my arms, till date i was't able to fulfill his last wish to let him to fire.... i was rewarded with the words that i took away their son from.....
My family just says that they don't have any expectations from me and i can leave home if i want.....
Don't have any friend in the city with whom i can talk....all left me when i came out....
Went to police station for help and was sexually abused there.... and never went back there.....
My life has everything from money to having spendthrift parents but what is the use of all this if they don't owe me or treat as their own blood?
I feel good when I see myself that I still not have lost the hope of being true to myself!</p>
<h1>GCI- I am so sorry for your loss...loss of your soul teared apart like this....but I know u will survive as you have survived this far...I cannot say that your loss is replacable or can be substituted but yes your future can be beautiful if your present have a beautiful thought of creating the future YOU want!</h1>
<p>You actually made me cry when i read that your lover died in your arms. No lover may ever suffer this fate...NEVER!</p>
<p>G bless honey! MAY THE RAINBOW BESTOW ALL THE COLOURS OF ITS BEAUTY UPON U!</p>
