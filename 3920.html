<h1>TORTURE OF MY PARENTS</h1>
<p>Hello admin..
this is a 21 years old mechanical engineering final year student...
well the things i wanna share goes like this...
i was in a relationship with my best friend from 2009-2010...&amp; i will not go in deep how that all happened..
we had a really good relationship...both love &amp; physical intimacy...
we had made some videos of our those moments...
&amp; one day on the 7th of july 2010 my mom &amp; dad somehow those videos...
&amp; confronted me &amp; later him..
since then my life has become hell..
i am the only child of my parents..
&amp; since childhood i have been a brilliant kid..
top in studies...even now college topper...
martial arts expert...state level tennis player...&amp; many more!!!!
i even was awarded by the former president Shrimati Pratibha patil...
but that doesn't change anything..
since that incident..
i cant keep cellphone with myself at nights...
i have to switched it off &amp; keep it in my parents room..
if i make new friends at college or coaching i cant hangout with them.
&amp; also my parents...especially my mom uses words like this to me ki kyun Randi naya shikaar dhund liya tuney...agar faaltu zyada dost banaye to college aur coaching dono band karvaakar ghar baitha denge...
if i even talk to someone on phone they come &amp; sit aside me....like i am a call girl dealing with one my customers!
the whole outside world appreciates me for my achievements...
but my parents counter me by saying ki unko tumhaari reality nhi maalum..
jabh sach pata chalega to sabh tere upar thookenge..
whenever i leave for college or coaching i have been continuously been taunted that deakh vaapas vo galti mat karna...humaari izzat mitti me mat milaana...
tumhaari job lag jaaye to phir janha jana ho jana...jisse marvaana ho maraana &amp; all that crap...
i even attempted suicide twice...
once by cutting my wrist down &amp; once by taking sleeping pills overdose...
but i was very unfortunate that i survived...
i know u will say u have no right of doing this to urself &amp; all....but keep urself at my place...what am i going through the past 4 years...everytime i leave home even to buy a packet of milk from my nearby walking distance i have to face those ridiculous words of my own parents...
&amp; each time i have to convince them ki i am a straight...galti ho gayi thi...but andar hi andar ghoot raha hun...kyunki sabh kuch pata hote hue bhi they doesn't wanna believe that their son is GAY...
jinki mein kabhi aankho ka tara tha...they were proud of me &amp; my achievements..
but ab to agar mein Noble me jeet jaau they will say ki unko tumhaari reality nhi maalum...
my own home feels like a jail to me!
i dont know...bas jiya ja raha hun...that's it</p>
<h1>GCI- Don't cry now. I guess you should have realized that by now that they are trying to break you down to someone who will be a robot for them and make you feel regret of yourself for what you are. You are not the first one that I have heard a case like this but certainly you are the first one who gets called a randi by his own mother. The best thing for you would be to take your time, study, get a job and don't contact your parents after. Certainly they don't love you and it won't do any good to you if you keep the expectations. Hard reality but you have to accept it. Do not let it take you down at all.</h1>
