<p>Lost in the deep gorges of those canyons where once I had feared to be lost forever. As now I see that u r no more, u have died for me. For the things that I wanna say will never reach your ears because for me u r mere a memory now. U know something we don't even have a single click of ours together! Maybe that was a sign that we were not meant to be. U never bring tears now but u take me into a trance and I keep talking to myself for hours and I relief myself. The romantic part in me have died, and I still don't know how! No u were not my first love, but I treated u like one, coz I just know how to love i don't know what is first, second or third love. I am not complaining that u went away but your cruel grin still daggers my heart. Your hidden truths still makes me worried about u at times. Your was not the way someone should treat others. No one deserves to be a substitute. Maybe I was stupid but u taught me that lesson which changed my life forever. U know I don't see your pic anymore, don't stalk u on facebook, nor do I feel anything whenever I see something connected with u. The false ceiling with the shining stars when we slept together, that locked up gate of my college where we got stuck, that sleeping of yours on my shoulder and that meeting u for the first time and feeling mesmerized seems like the story of the past ages. Hope u are happy with your new life with your ex cum present bf. But you know something! Something is missing and its still not yet touched. Would wait that to surface again just to forget u yet again forever I guess.</p>
