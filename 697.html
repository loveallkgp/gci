<p>Hello all
So here my confession goes..
2 years back...I fell in love wd a guy named vikram whom I met on yahoo msngr! It was my first tym that I ws exchanging numbr wid such a like minded person. He belonged to delhi. So before I could go to meet him, we had endless talks on internet and on phone as well.
I was d luckiest guy on this planet. He made me rely on a concept of being into a commit able relationship. 2 months passed and I went to meet him. We dated for so many days n he demanded me to hire a room for a day so that we can get intimated, which was not digest able for me. Though we had some kisses during the dates in open which were also his demands!
Well I broke up and consequently will ever not be able top believe in the concept of homosexual relationships since I dnt again want to feel guilty for my doings!
Ppl want to give here a piece of advice..its because of such polygamous routines of such ppl that gays are considered as a taboo!
Be in a commit able and loyal relationship so that we might nt end up suffering for STDs.
And also had it been a normal relationship..who asks to send ur naked pics or asks ur likes and dislikes in bed?? Stay in character and don't 
evr play with emotions!! </p>
<p>$ABBY : to few things i agree with to some i don't ... like somebody else's sex life is their choice , you don't need to teach them ( yeah but have safe sex and don't have many partners and always get checked up for std's or hiv before getting into bed with someone ) .</p>
