<p>I stay in a college hostel where i have a hostelmate who is apparantly straight though never had a girlfriend.
He does not have a girlfriend more because he hardly or never tries to get one, for he is not so good in socialising with people, having some psychological issues which make him believe that people around will have a bad impression if he ever goes, finds n tries to gel with some girl :O . And moreover he wants someone's companionship who smokes weeds, drinks regularly, listens to rock n metal music and might have an insight into Jim morrison's or kurt cobain's phylosophy of life. As apparantly girls are more into bollywood n lady gaga, he finds them incompatible to save his soul.</p>
<p>Well, lets come to the main portion. He has an integral nature of touching his close friends whenever he sits or stands or lies beside them...more like he keeps his hand over shoulder n else...and this tendancy is too profound to be noticed....and for me it's even severe.....yesterday, i was surfing through his laptop's hard drive for some movies when he happened to suggest me some straight porn to watch. So i thought to act like straight n played the porn...he also laid beside me n started watching....i was lying flat with the lappy over my stomach n he was lying beside me with one leg over me n the knee rubbing my tool :O ( this happened before, several times) and one of his hands was caressing my chest, specifically a finger circling my nipple.....(we were silent, n acting as if i was too physically paralysed to percieve his actions)..well, we started to watch the porn, reached to the situation when the girl starts to suck the man's manhood, we watched the whole part without forwarding the film a second, and as soon as the sucking session was over n the man started to lick the girl's genitalia, he got off saying the he might go vulnerable seeing those scenes, so he better be off to do his practical works rather than watching the porn further...</p>
<p>Well, this is a moment we shared yesterday.. Though i had this similar kind of experiences earlier even when we both were drunk n left alone specially...</p>
<p>Points to be mentioned, he never intends to specifically be left with me, or drink with me or watch porn with me...but if it ever happens to happen, he kind of utilises the situation.And he even watches lesbian porn.</p>
<p>Perhaps, he is damn straight who is devoid of any sexual contact with girls n touches of any human beings give him solace....but still i find it a bit version.</p>
<p>Could anyone out here give an insight on what kind of psychology might be there behind this 'more than over 'friendly' bodily intimations' of a male person with his close male friends!</p>
<p>Kolkata.</p>
<h1>GCI : girls are into lady gaga ??? whatttttttttt</h1>
<p>darling gays and lesbians are into  lady gaga ... indian girls hardly are into gaga .</p>
<p>anyhow i am very positive about this guy you are writing about and i don't think he has any problems . he is sure  bout what he wants and he acts like any other guy and there is nothing wrong with him . 
he watches lesbian porn .. well all straight men like lesbian porn , they get turned on . </p>
<p>and seriously stop observing poor guy and give him a space . just because someone is single doesn't mean they have some problems . maybe he don't like brunettes , maybe he is into interracial thing or maybe he just don't want to be in relation right now. </p>
<p>ps : i totally think you are the guy you are talking about :P :P how can somebody know about somebody else that deep .... that too hostel mates . </p>
<p>pps : well i am not psychologist but  i have been reading articles on human psychology and animal psychology as i find it interesting . so any psychology student or psychologist here who wants to say something :D</p>
