<p>What should a gay person do when hes very much influenced by his orthodox family and society cause hes alone and he has no Gay friends ?</p>
<h1>GCI- There is a plethora of do's and don'ts...but i will rather try to put it by scooping some of the main ones-</h1>
<p>1- IF u are depressed by all this ..then first of all calm down and don't let people get onto ur nerves.
2- U must have faith in urself when other's try to put lgbt down. Ur sexuality matters only to morons &amp; not to the sane...and honey we live in a country filled with assholes, so don't worry its not u....ITS THEM who should change!
3- Fear not anyone except ur weaknesses..coz only we can destroy ourselves mentally if we allow it..(exception is murder, rape or so)
4- U think that people matters..but in reality there is no PEOPLE..its ur perceptions that create a hoopla out of what u call society...no one has the fucking time to think about ur sexuality all the time.
5- Having gay friends may be a blessing or a shitpit..we need like minded people as friends and they can be anyone.....got that?
6- Ur family matters until it is with you....so make sure u don't feel burdened by them all the time....they are family so show them their place if they act like dictators all the time.
7- If u don't have guts..then develop them over the time and show it against ur family, the society, fucktards, or any other moron u come across...
NEVER SUCCUMB JUST BCOZ U R DIFFERENT .....</p>
<p>P.S- U don't need to do all the things at the same time ..first be independent....then be brave...then take stands for urself..and eventually be ready to LIVE for urself as well as for others(only for those who 'grow' with you and promote ur well being) bcoz u owe ur soul an explanation.
This will happen when u are self accepting, self appraising, self constructive and self-loving.</p>
<p>G-LUCK sugarcake!</p>
