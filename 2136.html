<p>NOTE: GCI i am not from india but I am an indian residing in Fiji, I have no where else i can post and get a serious reply from. and keep this annon
I can relate to confessor #2035</p>
<p>Here goes my confession.I am 21 and gay(not out yet). I have the same story in my life life besides the wheel chair part, but I bet the people in wheel chairs have a better happier life than me. I have working arms and legs, but I am not good looking nor do i have any one in life who truly cares for me or would make me laugh wen i am sad. I have little to no happiness, I feel like I would be much happier if i lived alone in some old hut in a forest alone, away from people.I thought i had some really awesome ppl, caring and people who cherish me but, it is turning out to be all all not true. Family at home is ok but my elder brother is more the apple of their eye, i am just existing there. My friends have started to replace me, make plans without me and dont tell me bout it until it has finished. Today i got a call on the last minute to come to an event, they have made me their last choice. My best friends have made me their last choice. I always give them first priority, i wait for them for lunch no matter how hungry i am, but they wount wait for me. I had finally thought to tell them I am gay, but I think they wount care for me and just tell me to fuck off. This feels too depressing and is affecting my studies. </p>
<p>HELP</p>
