<p>hi, I am 21 from bombay.
so I started chatting with this guy. we really had nice conversation. we went on date (sort of) . know him since 2 months or so. I have some feelings for him. I stay in touch with him by some way or the another. but I noticed that he never texts me by his own. I asked why he dont he says he dont know! last night I texted him casually then out of nowhere he says "now I am not in mood to talk about stuff " . I replied with smile and okay. but I don't know how to interpret this. Should I move things ahead or should I stop . ? </p>
<h1>GCI- Take a break for a while by not texting him. If he doesn't texts at all, then I guess you should move on. If he does text you and asks that where you have been, then he do feels something for you.</h1>
