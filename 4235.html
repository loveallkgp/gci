<p>17 years, i'm appearing class xii boards..
I guess i'm bisexual..dnt know for sure..:p
uh, its actually not like a confession, but the thing is i'm a little tensed..some guys might reply with abuses..coz i might sound like a despo, which actually i'm not..
The thing is, i had a gf in class viii, who ditched me after class x and we stop talking and broke our friendship too, and then contacted me in class xi becoz she had some work (she's somewhat selfish) after which we became friends again and then later in class xii, she asked me my fb's email id and password, and i was reluctant in giving (reason of which is too obvious!) and finally after being irritated for 3 days, i used a few slangs..and she returned even more dirty slangs..and everything was over once again..meanwhile, i had a relationship with a boy from Gorakhpur and our relationship ended in the beginning of this year coz he never 'valued' me, but he asked for another this Durga Puja, and being unable to trust him like before, i said i can't take a risk, and he said, he'll always be waiting for me.. And then i fell for my classmate (she's my bestie now, and i've told her i'm bisexual and she's so fine with it! She's awesome)
yesterday, my ex (the first girl i mentioned) poked me on fb and gave a message 'poked you by mistake', and i replied 'it's okay'
after my reply, she has been appearing as friendly as ever!
So, should i also become friendly with her? (Coz i have some soft corner in my heart for her..) or learning from past, i shouldn't trust her again?
And what about my ex bf? As for now, i want to focus only on my studies and carrier, but should i give him another chance? Not that i'll go to him right now, but i could talk to him after my exams, maybe..
n.b.: i do not hate any of the 3 people..rather, i somewhat like all of them!</p>
<h1>GCI- About that guy, have you told him whatever you feel? Because to make someone behaving a certain way with you, you have to be honest with them when feelings are concerned. Try telling him about it.</h1>
<p>About the girl who is your bestie, they can be amazing.</p>
<p>About your ex, you can bid her farewell forever.</p>
<p>And lastly, don't sail in two boats at once. You will be bound to drown.</p>
