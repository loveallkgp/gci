<p>I am suffering from inferiority complex because i look ugly, unattractive, i have effeminate body language which is unacceptable to most of the people, coz i don't know much about the technology or sports or brands etc., coz i talk stupid, coz people laugh at things i have interest in and find them boring! What to do when you lag behind at things which almost everyone around is good at? I feel so inferior, losing all my confidence! :(</p>
<h1>GCI : you know i don't have knowledge on sports or politics or technology either .. you know why ?? coz i don't have interest in them . as simple as that and no one ever made fun of me coz i was frank about it when they started any such topic i would just say ' i am out' or ' change the topic' .</h1>
<p>don't feel inferior . you must know about your interest and follow them . you don't need to fit in .</p>
<p>feminine is just as superior as much is musculine . if people have problem with it , just don't sit with them . this makes you a superior person , why sit with them . sit with people who like you for your nature and not what sexuality or body language or interests you have .</p>
