<p>Confession goes like this.....
I am an average guy and the guy I love is much more younger than me, but I know age doesn't matter. When I use to open my fb account I use to chat with guys and flirt with them... but after meeting him and texting and talking over the phone... I found myself that I love him. I proposed him as well but he said that he will reply me on my birthday.... He did the same thing. He came to wish me on my birthday and we were both together for almost 24 hrs. When the time came for us to go back to our own cities I was feeling as if I was loosing something from my side...... I was thinking as if I was left alone, my fingers were shaking, was feeling very low... I had sleeping pills to sleep that night very next day I again felt the same way dat I was left alone... I know I may be acting little childish in this matter as this is my first relationship..... how do I need to handle the situation wisely.....Please help... just give me the wise comment...</p>
<h1>GCI- Try and be confident, maybe? Speak about your insecurities and fear. Those are the things you have spit out. If you don't they will weigh you down. You can tell it to anyone. To us over here, to any trustworthy friend who knows about you, or to the guy you are dating if you are comfortable with him.</h1>
