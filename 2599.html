<p>hello GCI, i'd love some advice, coz i'm neck deep in trouble. ok some background; i'm out to my family and they're not very supportive but still tolerable. i'm under psychiatric treatment for excess anxiety, and my psychiatrist is borderline homophobic, so i cant talk to him. ok so, i met this guy 1 month ago on facebook. we hit it off pretty quick and he asked me out, and kind of swept me off my feet when he did that. we've shared really sacred (non-sexual) parts of our souls even though it's a long distance relationship. but about a week ago i went ahead and asked for a break. i dont know why i did that, i'm an introvert so that could be one reason that i was feeling crowded out of my personal space. and its tough on both of us. could this be coz of my medicines, coz they are known to cause mood swings as a side effect. how do i make amends?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well first of all you can tell your bf about the reasons of your mood swings so that he can't get doubtful on you. Next thing I'm not clear about why you need a break... Its just one month. People are in their honeymoon period during this time. It is a getting to know process and you are taking a break. BTW, next time you are set to make a decision like this, just double think over it even if you think you are right. If you know how his brain works then step into his shoes and imagine how would he feel if you put your thinking into action.</h1>
<p>Thirdly, you are already into a long distant relationship. HOw much space do you need? You are living separately, there is no personal interruption. Even if you are an introvert, it doesn't mean the people who trust you do not have any access to you. The partner should be the first one to break those barriers and if you have already shared part of your souls, it can't be said that your introvert quality is tampering with your head. But its not too late to increase your boundaries and not give a fuck about negative stuff whether its the parents indifference or the homophobic doctor.</p>
