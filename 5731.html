<p>I m bisexual...more inclined towards boys...21 yr old...out to my family as gay..coz I m pretty clear tht I want to spend my lyf with a guy...its my choice...today I met with a guy..we r seeing each other for almost a month...we almost fell for each other..so I thought I must tell him today..tht I m bisexual..before taking a next step..when I told him..he jst changed totally after hearing tht...he said tht he don't want to date me anymore..jst coz I m bie!! Why don't u gays accept d point of being a bi..u want society to understand u...ur emotions...but u r nt ready to understand someone else..!! How will u workout things man...!! nd its not abt bi people...!! Lot of gays r nt ready to accpt trnsgenders..girlish gays...wat is dis yr..???</p>
<h1>GCI- HEAR HEAR!!! Words of wisdom from a bi guy!</h1>
<p>First of all a very warm hug to u from the admins.
See sweetcake u must understand that Indian gays and society are both fucked up.
1-They(90%approx) are not self analysts at all.
2- The MARRIAGE hoopla scares every gay guy( getting married or their partners getting engaged to a girl).
3- Bi people don't have a respectable or acceptable position due to their fucked up deeds(fucking gay men in the name of love...and gay men using them as sex toys too).
4- It is because of bi's that gays are misunderstood to be bi or passing through a phase.(general notion)
5- Transphobia and homophobia are spread by both bi and gay people...what will u say now?</p>
<p>Considering all these major criterias it is very difficult for a truthful gay guy to be with a nice person like u. Just like gays u also have to work upon the image of BI people by ur deeds..NOT BY UR WORDS!
CHAO...ARRIVIDERCI!</p>
