<h1>GCI- Folks don't read it all...and the gist is-</h1>
<p>He is a feminine gay guy who fell in love with a dick and he used him emotionally, came back after his gf left him and now is asking him to move on in his life but the guy is stuck.</p>
<h1>GCI- Beta u need to understand that love is a lifetime affair which is not based on weak emotional bonding or longings of the heart. Instead live your life the way it should be lived and stop having self pity on thyself first. Love urself indestructibly first bcoz then only u qualify to love someone with all ur might.</h1>
