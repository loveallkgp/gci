<p>Hai frnds, I m Kunal from Hyderabad.. 
Here I have one confusion... 
Being gay I'm proud of it.. I'm not a top nor bottom but the thing is I'm in relationship with some other guy... 
We enjoy each n every moment of our lives I used to stay in their home only even I joined in hostel...  His parents also know me as a good friend to him it's already we spent three years...  But in my relationship I am not fair...  I used to meet so many guys whom I like through pr or Fb..  I thought he is very fair.. He didn't meeting anyone but the fact went wrong...  Wen I checked there are so many gay numbers he is chtng with them.... I didn't have trust on him because he is married gay he is also meeting other person wen I asked directly he said I'm just chtng not for fun...  But his love on me it was pure n my love too... But I am not able control myself to meet others wen I found he is also meeting others. Wht should I do? ....  Plzzz give me a solution</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, where do you see yourself in future? If it includes getting married to a girl and having secret flings, then keeping this relation is fine. If you imagine your future like staying together with a guy permanently, then you are ruining it right now. You will always be on a hook, not able to move forward. Decide what you want to do and act accordingly.</h1>
