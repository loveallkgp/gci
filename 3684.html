<p>Three years since I recognized my sexuality, yet, love has always been a distant fruit for me. Fell for a guy but apparently,  things didn't work out the way they were supposed to.  By the time I came to know that he already loved someone; it was too late. Ultimately,  I had to back off, breaking all my contacts with him, for his own well being. I was shattered to bits, wet eyes and sleepless nights felt like a second nature. Tried to do everything to overcome the emptiness, including making new friends,  long phone conversations with people, alcohol, chain smoking and even random hookups.  It felt good at that time but it never felt right. After months of self question-ing
I came to a conclusion that I can never forget him.
 Not even a single day passes when I don't miss him. His laughter and typical Punjabi accent still  echos in my ears. Its been over an year since we last talked; yet it feels like it just happened yesterday.  Since then, I've always been afraid of falling in love again. I developed serious trust issues. Thought about deactivating my social accounts like multiple times but never could. I somehow,  still have a hope that one day, I'll find someone who will love me for who I am. I daily log into my account with the same hope but it turns out to be nothing. 
I sometimes think that had I not fallen in love;  I would have been a totally different personality. However,  I do not regret falling in love. It is the BEST thing that I've experienced till now. 
Even after so much of pain, I still believe that it'd happen again but with the right person and that right person is definitely difficult to find.  And, I'm not giving up until I locate him. </p>
<h1>GCI- Where are such guys? i never actually had a convo with guys like you. Eh...</h1>
