<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Something shit happened today in the evening....My mom was searching my worn off pants for washing them and suddenly found a wrapper of something which she handed to me directly without giving a second look
...guess what!!! It was a condoms's wrapper and I was like OMG what on the earth a kind of a goodluck I have....now don't wonder so much guys I keep condoms with myself in a secret place just for the sake of keeping or to give to a friend in dire need....but the wrapper thing was because of my bestie ...she wanted to see a condom in her hands and that bitch even made a balloon out of it....seriously girls these days....anyways coming to my part I was totally numb for a second and thought that how can i be so stupid and forgetful about such 'secret' things..lol....I thanked my angels and god for keeping a helping hand for me and staying by my side and I said to myself....somewhere some power or luck do exist I guess..otherwise 'MAA da ladla bigad gya' would had been proven and proven very strongly....</p>
<p>So next time u use a condom or show it to your friend make sure u throw the wrapper right away ...beginners luck doesn't always favour..(courtesy paulo coelho- the alchemist)</p>
