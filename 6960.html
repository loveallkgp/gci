<p>If only I would've told my parents that I'm Transsexual as well as Bisexual when I was young. Either that, or I would've cried when coming out to them on the phone.
Am thinking to give up now. Just too tired of holding it all up. Especially when it's been 12 years. Came out to them 3 weeks back and got scolded for even thinking about the operation. It's so hard to control. Have rope inside my cupboard. Have 5 Blades on my desk (haven't cut for around 5 days). Can get poison easily at any shops nearby. Not sure which one to choose. Just too tired of holding it up. :'(</p>

<h1>GCI- First of all, DISCARD THOSE THINGS THAT COULD HARM YOU! That's an order! Got it! Sometimes we gotta give tough live to some people and there it is.There is a wide range of community who could accept you the way you are and not judge you. There are problems in everybody's life, you deal with them and not give up. I can understand that you came out under emotional pressure and it's not easy. Learn to grow from your experiences.</h1>
