<p>Hello admin and all my dear friends. I am Arijit Biswas , today I would like to share a few things related to LGBT in Hindu mythology . It is gonna to be bit long and bit complex , so if you lack patience or brain please avoid it. Most of the orthodox Hindus nowadays argue that homosexuality is a western influence and their culture has no place for homosexuality. To them I would like to say that homosexuality is proudly celebrated in Hinduism . There are lesbian , gay , bisexual and gender fluid gods and goddesses. Most of the people know about god Ayyappa who was born out of 'ayoni' (non-vaginal intercourse) between lord 'Shiva' and 'Mohini' (transsexual avatar of Vishnu) it is mentioned in Bhagavata Puran. God 'Agni ' is a bisexual god who is married to goddess 'Savha' , it is said that he had sexual relation with god 'Soma'(lunar god) , god 'Agni' is also known to have accepting semen of other gods in his mouth. God 'Varun' and 'Mitra' are said to have homosexual relation. They have two sons born out of non-vaginal sex , they ejacuated their semen in earthen pot in the presence of Urvashi , this context is similar to that of nowadays gay men having children through surrogacy. There are depictions of androgynity also , the 'Ardhanarishwar' Avatar and 'Lakshmi-Nayaran ' avatar represents man and women fused in one , which is called androgynous nature. There are many tales of Lesbian love also, in a context of 'Krittivasa Ramayana ' a a famous child born out as a result of lesbian intercourse. When king 'Dilipa' of 'Sun Dynasty' died without a heir , his two widowed bisexual queens made love with each other and gave birth to 'Bhagiratha ' who brought 'Ganga ' in the earth. Cross-dressing and change of sex is also common and is mentioned in many manuscripts. In Mahabharata , Shakandhi , Arjuna(short period cross dresser) and Chitrangada. Even Krishna's one of the son, 'Samba' is a cross dresser. Even there is a subtext found in 'Vedas' known as 'Sakhiyan' in which lesbian erotism is depicted . Transsexuality and Transgender people are also mentioned in many Hindu manuscripts. Many of you must have heard about 'Bahuchara Mata' the goddess of transgenders . According to Tamil Version of Mahabharata a incident have been mentioned in which lord Krishna played the role of a female to make 'Aravan' experience sexual love before his death. Hindus even have a goddess who is lesbian. A fine example of gender-fluidity is mentioned in 'Shiv-Puran' about king 'Ila' ,who used to live like both a man and a woman and was married to god of mercury Budha(not to be confused with Gautama Buddha), he was also married to women . Apart from manuscripts homoerotism can be seen in places like ,Khajaroo, Ajanta &amp; Ellora , in the famous Konark temple, in many famous ancient south Indian temples. If homosexuality is a sin according to the belief of few modern orthodox hindus then why homosexuality was depicted in auspicious places like temples, why it is regarded as devine. Even in Kamasutra homoerotic things are encouraged. When science says homosexuality is normal , hindu religious extremists says its against our culture , to such people I must say do you even know what 'Hinduism' is? Hinduism originally is the most open minded and liberal religion. Personally I don't believe in having or supporting any religion but I feel , few people must know it. Hoping to post soon about LGBT and other religion if the admin permits.</p>
