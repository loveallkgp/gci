<p>Be a man , love your boyfriend. Take responsibilities as much as you can.
Be a man, earn some positive attitude, be passionate , make your life independent.</p>
<p>Don't forget to be industrious, ni to life latak jayega. Rest all depend on your thinking how badly you want him. You'll get this life for once ,live gently, live peacefully . If you look up to your family , you can respect someone's feeling too. </p>
<p>It's your problem, you'll sort it out. Everyone was going through the same situation. How it was affecting on our life ,we all had faced it. Many of us have reached a point where we started to think after being in a relationship 'I deserve a better guy' or got bored. It's nothing but lack of respect towards your buddy.</p>
<p>I am bisexual. My buddy is bisexual. Got enough strength to protect him physically and mentally from everything .Na look kharab hain aur na brain main kuch kami. Doctor banne wala hun,and he is studying astrophysics. We get hardly a little free time ,life is moving faster than the bullet trains. Let's face this life with love. Mom dad ko khayal rakhne k liye main akela hi kafi.  </p>
<p>Have some perspicuity in your life. Some worst problem you gonna face. Analyse and think. You'll definitely find a way to handle it. At last your happiness will matter.</p>
<p>This New Year may you banish all your fears, doubts and worries as you make room for dreams, aspirations and joys. Wish you happy new year !!!!!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Happy new year to you and your boyfriend too. Stay safe and stay happy.</h1>
