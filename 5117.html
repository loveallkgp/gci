<p>In Dilema!#</p>
<p>4yrs ago, a senior friend, in final year and me as a 1st yr student bump into each otr in an event. At night we slpt togtr and he startd kisin me on my lips. Was so so shockd n kisd him back. In da following days n months n a year we frequently hav such physical touch and intimacy but not sex. He always try to avoid da climax n never allow me to hav sex. At times he ignores me at da same time he enjoys my every touch yet trying to resist from action. He always claimd hmslf as STRAIGHT and feels al these as temporary feelings b4 marriage. Moreover, he was super Religious and consider GAY as SINNERs. During dos days i badly, deeply fall in love with him and his neglegence n resistance hurts me many a times. Today i move on wit a boy friend in my lif after his graduation. But recently, aftr 4yrs gap we met again in a 7days conference in Bangalore n coincidentaly we wer accomodated together. Dis tim he open up to me dat he too is GAY n contrld his feelings towards me n hide his best. He said he realisd being gay is natural n he loves me always n always being haunted by our memories togetr durin ths 4yrs. He kisd me again n said iam da reason he live he life for n nt to leave him again. Sayin truly sory for dos denying moments n wants me back to his lif As there is none in his lif to share such truth. Weeping bitterly, hugging me tightly n understanding his Emotion I became SPEECHLESS. Whr am i? Whr ami? </p>
