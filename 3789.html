<p>Diary tales #1</p>
<p>"Why it must go on?" My brain barked.
"End it then, if you can!" Challenged my Heart.
From that indecisive day to another day after 5 long years.
"Why you must end it? There is no logic!" My Brain barked again.
"Go on, continue, then, if you can" Heart replied in a rather stern note.</p>
<p>From stealing glances in the classroom to sharing a bench. From leaving me out in a crowd of friends to holding my hand when the same crowd mocked at me. From, lol, slapping me for holding you tight while tears rolled down my cheeks, on my b'day (thinking I'm seducing you) to swearing by God that You Love me like you never loved anyone else ever. From calling me selfish, opportunistic to forcing me to share your meals (for I had no money once upon a time, hehe). From making fun of me (for Loving you n being a Gay) in front of your family to those restless endless sweaty nights when we made love! From pushing me away cussing "stay away, you faggot" to punching me, saying "how dare you go out with another guy?" 
Those 5 years took a lifetime to end. </p>
<p>We both know, we both died and rose again. I could never say "thank you" may be because you were rightfully mine. I thank you today. For loving and losing me. Hence, I set you free and hence, I set myself free.</p>
