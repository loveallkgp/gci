<p>M 22,</p>
<p>the guy with confession no 1525 n 1535, sorry i am kinda pushing you guys a lot, but i just want to know your final verdict viv, for ,in the first confession you wrote that he is gay and he won't accept it, n in second your views are a bit different, so what do you finally say that he is straight and all of that was just a spur of moment??</p>
<p>and to all the people as well as abby, I have moved on in such situations for 6 times in past, my worst being, when a guy said he loves me, got intimate with me(just oral sex) and then told me that he did all of that for lust and apologized, i have moved on from that as well and that too with ease when i hadn't told anybody about my sexual orientation and fought it all alone, along with all those times, when i fell in love with the wrong guy and had to move on cos i didn't have a choice n they all are my closest friends now, n i do almost everything i can do to help them..... but this time, i felt different probably cos the care that he shows towards that nobody has shown before and i cannot ignore the fact that since i have had sex with him, that also gives me the idea that he can't accept it n ol.... i know i am putting myself in a lot of shit right now, though i am doing a lot better for past 2 days, i have stopped crying and i do not know whether it is for the good or for the bad but i will get over him in few days, cos yes abby my career and my family both are really imp to me, n i do understand that you cannot make somebody fall in love with you,if it happens, it happens n i never started loving him with the condition that he should love me back too, and moreover he loves me as a friend, he has used the phrase i love you quite a lot times with me......but for him it's probably just friendship n nothing more but the doubt makes me go cranky :P</p>
<p>Gosh i write too much and yes i speak even more than that :D</p>
<p>thank you for bearing me.....</p>

<h1>Viv- Buddy I never really changed my views. My every word was centered around you as a main point. In the first confession I told you that what you really deserve and that is a person with a clear mind. In the second confession I gave the advice regarding the same and according to what you wrote new in it. It was more about moving on and about your understanding. You know you know it all. You know how to do get past it, you know what things matter to you. I really can make out what's holding you back to achieve what you want and to get yourself back on the right track. If your friend's words or his presence are really troubling you then you really should not meet him and contact him in any way for 2 months or so just to clear your mind up. Trust me when I say this, if he is around you, you are not gonna get into the right senses because its about the doubt that make you go cranky. Remove that doubt. Sometimes you have to let things go apart to make space for new things in your life. If you want to talk more about it, just hit us up in the inbox.</h1>
