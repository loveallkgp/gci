<p>Guys, I just don't know how to deal with this situation. I'm B.E and got placed in same city which I'm 4rm..</p>
<p>I know that I'm Gay at a very early age, and decided to not to get married... I know that in our country, these relationships are still a Taboo... I know that I'm not allowed to see guys infront of others as my straight friends do to girls.. I know that I can't fell in love or have feelings for a guy throughout my life as I have to be 'responsible' son.....</p>
<p>Problem is, despite of the fact that I know many things, why I'm not blessed with endless courage to come out?! If situation triggers, I thought I would do so... But, still I didn't..</p>
<p>I don't know how many of u remember my confession(anyway that was posted months ago), I fell for a guy who is extremely hansome and appeared to live in an apartment sideby...</p>
<p>I dared and started having little chats, and found, fortuantely, his attitude was a perfect match to me. We soon became friends, I invited him to my house.. He felt so happy for me and my family.. Things are going good.. we're going out to movies, hanging out and having nice time..</p>
<p>It was that time, his family started searching bride for him (he's 27, well settled) and he told the same to me.. I (pretending to be 'normal') told all d best, and said that I'm so happy for you(I know that I'm not )... The next day, his behaviour seemed a bit awkward.. He never turned down any my invites before, which he is doing now.. He just gives small 's' or 'no' replys instead of long msgs which he used to give.. I sensed that change and wantedly went to his home.. at that time, discussions(yellings??) are going on between his parents and him.. So, i left the place and messaged him to meet at our common place..</p>
<p>He met me and broke into tears hugging me and said " I don't know why, you seemed to be a best friend to me. I just don't want to marry.. My parents are nt getting me.. " , I asked him why, but he didn't tell anything.. I asked 'Any problem', he said nothing...</p>
<p>I'm in so much fear that he would break friendship with me, If I ask any 'unwanted' questions... I just had some chat vth him, which I thought relieved him, and concluded vth 'Give life some time to heal, everything vl b just fine' and we left..</p>
<p>Recently, I came to know that, his father even bet him coz he confessed that he is gay.. But I felt really really happy that he is one, but sadly, the family did not accept and let him go away.. As of now, I left many messages to his FB nd wassup.. no reply.. called.. switched off..</p>
<p>I still wonder, why I didn't confess, the moment he told me that he don't want to get married? I thought that's d situation that triggered me to confess.. But why I didn't</p>
<p>Dear, desperately waiting for you... just a hope that if you too are in this group, reply me...</p>
<h1>GCi- Wow, that is something serious. Buddy, go to his home and check once if he is in the right condition or not. If I were in your place, I would definitely go and see if he is okay or not. I don't know, it would be my duty as a human. Help him in any case if you can?</h1>
