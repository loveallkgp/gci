</li>
<li>
<p>He used me sometimes literally.. he used to meet me sometimes just becoz one of his frnds has to come so for the time being he met and left by saying my frnd gonna come soon .. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't believe in love now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometimes he msgs me but I don't give a fuk to reply even.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>*My Words: I loved you I love you for who you were no matter we could not take it for long you taught me how to feel the love your touch could made me alive your hug could made me feel like m flying in your arms and there is no safe place other than that.. Its OK we dint meet in this birth may you could not recognise me that m only that one whome you met in last birth .. I have loved you for 1000 of years and m gonna love you for thousands more "" we will meet and complete our story :)</p>
<h1>GCI- My answer would be.</h1>
<p>1- Commitment must be the last thing said in words and the first one in practise.
2- U can never know each other if u don't open up ur past wounds or ur entire life and then ask him whether he can handle his present.
3- If u r in love, mere loving and caring does not suffice.
U have to be present in all the spheres of ur guy's life; sometimes wantedly and sometimes unwantedly or indirectly because we don't really try to understand our partner's individuality.
4- Never demand importance by comparing urself with the partners' best friend. In this way it is an insult to U both( u and the friend). Command importance but remember it mus not make him compromise with his/her self respect.
5- If u drank hot milk and got ur tongue burned that doesn't mean the milk is bad.
6- Never allow ur exes to msg u( if u r not on talking terms) and treat them as 'dead people'.</p>
<p>P.S- U could have skipped the Twilight saga's song coz it is really very deep and not everyone can understand its depth.</p>
