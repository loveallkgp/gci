<p>26 doc punjab
its not a confession..i just wanna share something with u...
its almost 4 year when i completed my degree ..sometimes its very difficult for a person to adjust in a new hostle environment who had never spent a single day without parents till that day..same happened with me..i took almost 1 yr to adjust there..
its all about my rum mate for whom m writing all this ..he was not my rummate frm 1st yr.. we became rummates in 2nd prof..nd frm that day our attachment grew day by day..jb vi mai rum me aata tha after taking bath he used to tease me k itni sexy body leker mere samne mat aaya kr nhi to rape ho jayega tera..etc etc.....nd due to these one day we both were out of control nd got intimated..nd this continued till the end of degree...here intimacy means body play , sleeping together in one blanket in winter , sometimes masterbating each other, bathing together in the absence of other batchmates( jb wo ghar gye hote the ) and nthing vulgar beyond that.....
we used to fight a lot..itni jyada k kbi kbi to ek dusre ke kapde vi utha k rum se bahar fenk dete the ..kbi kbi to parents ko interfere krna padta tha..lol...whole clg was knowing our frndship ..it was like 'A" khi na mile to " B " se puchte nd vice versa ...even the clg staff professor sb jante the hamari jodi :) 4 sal baad to clg staff vi bhul jata hai almost kafi students ko ..bt mai 6 mnth pahle kisi kam se clg hospital gya to gatekeeper uncle asked" tere sath ek dusra ladka vi hota tha..wo kaisa hai ..kya kr raha hai ajkal..clinic khol lia? etc etc..
kbi kbi batchmates haste the " saalo tum sara din sath e chipke rhte ho ..tum gay to ni ho na ? "
ab hame mile hue vi almost 2 year ho chuke hai ..bt chat or call almost daily..ek ek 2 2 ghanta ..nd attachment has even grew more with time..we miss a lot bt due to career issues , couldnt meet ..he gives me a new name daily..lo :p jis din news paper me jo name mil jaye headline me..us din wo e nam se gd mng msg aata hai uska..eg gd mng malala darling ( jis din malala ko nobel piece prize mila)
gd mng ban- ki - moon, gd mng gabber etc etc...but i like these names &lt;3 :)
he is straight nd m Bi ...he knows about my this fake id...mai kise kise mila etc..
nd u know what he is jst one day younger than me..12 nd 13 jan 1989 .our birthdays</p>
<p>oops ...i think its got quite lengthy....</p>
<p>i just wanna say that frndship doesnt depends on the orientation..it depends on the mentality of the person..i tried frndship with 2-3 guys here bt always got hurt..here people do frndship after seeing my face nd break up when i refused to share bed as i cant do sex with anybody without any feeling in ma mind..nd some do frndship jst for their timepass when they have nthing to do nd nobody else to talk ..</p>
