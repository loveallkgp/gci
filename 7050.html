<h1>GCI- You two have lost the spark. It takes work of a highest mental level to keep a relationship together for years. You both have to sit down and talk to each other. Sometimes it happens like this that when you are too much available for someone, they lose your value and consider you as an object in their life. Only when they lose the person, they realize how big of a mistake they made. It's kind of a love and hate relationship with the practical issues that you have to keep in mind to work out a relationship.</h1>
