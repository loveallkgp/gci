<p>Hello guys, I'm confessing from New York. I saw this page in the side links and immediately followed it. I spent most of the night reading confessions and looking at images the fellows posted. One pic that caught my attention(a gay couple who were together since long time) and in the comment section a guy wrote that its all legal in the west. Having said that, I'd like to clarify a few things.</p>
<p>1) The gay movement in the west, as you guys call it, started long ago but it recently became acceptable by law in the USA.
2) The DOMA(Defense Of Marriage Act) was struck down but that was a Federal judgment. In some states same-sex marriage is not acceptable by law.
3) There are Christian societies still spreading hate against homosexuals in their churches.
4) Even though the condition seems to be quite appealing from the outside but hate crimes do happen. People are killed. Are they killed in your country?
5) Many devout Christian families are still not acceptable of their gay kids.</p>
<p>The USA gay liberation movement is quite old but people are still hated. In your country the movement is young, approximately 20 years old or so but there is definitely a big change in the small span of time. In the west, when things were pretty bad, gay people still lived together but now in some states we can freely marry.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel delighted at these two young fellows trying to spread goodwill among the gay crowd there and making them feel proud of being gay. I'm glad that I came here. Although I couldn't understand many confessions because they are written in Hindu style but whatever I was able to get wasn't bad.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<h1>Viv- My my my, we are getting international audience as well? Wow! Thanks for appreciation buddy. I hope this confessions helps you all to clear out some doubts and make you a bit proud.</h1>
