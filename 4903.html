<p>Hi guys,
I manu from yesterday's post. I wanted advice and ended up detailing the whole narration. Sorry guys. I thank you all for the lovely comments. I appreciate that. But I narrated the whole story not to be applauded as a hero but to tell other guys out there, who are in similar situation, that there's always hope. Suicide is not the answer.
Someone suggested that I might be gay myself. Well, never in my life I ever had any feelings or attraction or whatsoever towards another guy. No offence to anyone but I am heterosexual.
Advice i want is how to keep an eye on him without making him uncomfortable 'coz the doc told me that he is still vulnerable and could try it again if he doesn't feel good. I want him safe and healthy. I don't want to annoy him but I am sure that if he finds out that I am keeping an eye on him he would be so angry.
Hope you guys understand my dilemma. And guys I am not asking for anyone to applaud me as a hero. I don't think I have done something extraordinary. Most people would have done the same thing.
Thanks once again. Hope you guys will be able to advise me on this.
Regards,
Manu</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, when a person is unable to speak about his/her sad feelings to anyone and they pent up inside of him. That bottling up of sadness reaches a limit and in some cases the result is an attempt to suicide. When he goes well just ask him to say everything that he feels. Listen to him, give him a hug for that. Make him believe that you are with him as a brother and family. His family disowned him, that is why he is being like this. Just talk with him about each and everything without feeling awkward. Be his rock.</h1>
