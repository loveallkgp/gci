<p>hi guys...well its a realization and a food for thought.....i see guys coming here to confess about their love life..their anguish and their laments...their fear and their acceptance..their strife and their struggle...here i want to say that what does the people want from us......i still cant get answers....on the one hand when it is stated that GAY LOVE OR GAY MARRIAGE IS AN UTOPIA...i personally feel that things need to be bucked up...when it is said that marriage is about commitment..family..sociability...then i see infidelity....nuclear families with loneliness and no good upbringing.....just money matters everywhere...not everywhere but yes i see people growing up in the weirdest way possible regarding culture..tradition stuff....etc etc ....in most of the families...GAYS are blamed that the institution of marriage would be lost...if they marry!!!!!but what exactly is the ground root basis of marriage????is it people nurturing hatred..or running blindly after money or just for having sex with a license called MARRIAGE?????when we ask questions about gay marriage they say its UNNATURAL...UNACCEPTABLE..AND BLASPHEMOUS..etc etc...but when the same people commit heinous crimes of dowries..child marriage...and killing people (honour killings)..i doubt what exactly are we learning????marriage or BUSINESS of relationships????GAYS are blamed for promoting blasphemy and satanic thoughts that may ruin the SOCIETY....but what exactly is the society for???an imaginary MORAL POLICING GUARDIAN..or the outcome of human cohesiveness????when asked on the grounds of morality same sex relations take a backseat...on the grounds of spirituality A SOUL is neither male nor female..it has not been assigned a gender...so religious teachers and spirituality is different..and is INDIVIDUAL...PROVED...then why double standards for different people???when asked on the basis of individuality ....society interferes ...when asked on the term of society...culture intervenes...when asked on cultural strings...religion comes to the rescue..when questioned on the terms of religion..spirituality makes an ambush attack...when further tantalised on the basis of spirituality..then morality of the assigned body's gender is the answer and when asked the same thing again on the platform of universal naturality ..we get the same CLICHED answer of 'WHAT WILL THE SOCIETY SAY'???? they always are in a way trying to say that the same thing WHAT WE DONT WANT TO UNDERSTAND WE SHALL NOT ACCEPT...and for that they take any LOGIC or whatever serves the purpose!!!! and react acrimoniously....i guess we are living in the age of GALILEO GALILIE!!! And now tell me whom are these HOMOPHOBES AND ANTI-GAY ACTIVISTS FOOLING???themselves or the society???</p>
