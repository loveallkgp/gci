<p>I m confessor 5404 ...
I wud just like to clarify myself a bit more
I just don't want to be vj andy .i don't even like him ..all I wanted to say is my preferences just don't make me what people say ..especially my brother . We'll no one wud know until they r in my place . I just feel tired of making my choices according to the society .why shud I ...my friends never taunt me ...their r many friends of mine who r foul mouthed but they never said a word against my demeanour . All I want is acceptance the way I am . Ya it's ok that my bro wanted to let me know the norms of the society but I thing things cud hav been dealt in a more gentle way than the humiliation that it caused me . All I did was just laugh and at times he joked in a way that made me cry but all I did was smile in front of everyone letting them know tat I was used to all these and tat was meant to be taken as a joke . But when u r constantly the butt of the joke tat questioned ur demeanour then u wud understand how tiresome it becomes after sometym to keep on smiling when u just want to scream aloud and weep from within . It did affect me a lot ..on a personal front it made me strong and made me realise tat when my brother couldn't accept the way I m ( just like another guy but who didn't like sports and instead liked the culinary world) then I cudnt hope any better to be accepted by my friends tat I make in future ....</p>
