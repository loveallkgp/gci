<p>Hey hi frndzzz..... If u r really my frndz then please help me...l need it to avoid my troubleful confusion ........
My name is Vinghesh and I m from mumbaiii.... I m bisexual. When I was in 8th standard I got my first bf....we are alwase together from our first dating. He love me alot.....
Previous year I joined degree college where l got a pretty girl... I found that I was attracted towards her ....she too lyk me....
Now I m confused....I love both so much. I can't leave without her and him...I m confused what to do....plz help me to solve this love puzzle...</p>
<h1>GCI- Do you love him a lot like he does? If you were then wouldn't have fallen for the girl. And are you sure that it is love for her and not just a mere attraction? People can mistake crush for love a lot. Anyway, whatever you do, do it wisely. You are gonna hurt either one of them in the end or both of them at the same time.</h1>
