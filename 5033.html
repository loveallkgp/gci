<p>hi admin..</p>
<p>how are you ?</p>
<p>yaar i was confess about my very bad incident.
as we all know planetromeo/grindr are just for sex.</p>
<p>so i used to use this sites on my vacations. being honest, i have had sex with 3 guys from PR .
but 2 months pehle esa hua ki maine gay logo se milna hi chhod diya hai.
the reason was this..</p>
<p>i have had sex twice with a same guy.
and later on he made a gay group on whatsapp then uske 2 friends ne bhi mujhe sex k liye offer kia but i was uncomfortable with them. so i said no them.
after few weeks.. the same guy(with whom i had sex) called me for sex. and it was my vacation and i trusted him coz i have already met him twice before. so i went to his room. he has big flat . so first me we had coffee and talks for 30mins. then we started doing sex.
i am versatile but I'm 19 and he's 28 so i became bottom for him. when we were fully naked and lying on each other. his 3 friend came from his inside room. i get scared but my sex partner said that it was planned the day before it already . i said no i can't do it. but they'll forced me , mere clothes hi nai derahe the. and one bye one they fucked me for 4 hours. they all were above 30 and ek toh his early 40s me the.</p>
<p>seriously. now i don't get scared of that incident but i get scared meeting new guys. :/</p>
<h1>GCI- Yikes. Scary as hell. If they did it without condom then go and get checked. From next time, build a trust level with the one you arr gonna share the bed with. If you meet random fucked up shit, you are gonna get something like this only. It's way better they didn't turn out to be a money extortion gang or anything.</h1>
