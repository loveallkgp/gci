<p>Dear admins,
Great to know that in this sheer community u r providing correct path n resolution to our problems.
Well I know m gay but feel like I was not naturally born as a gay child. I might be wrong but when I was 12 an incident happened with me which totally changed my orientation. I was having a sleep wid my elder cousin who was then 17 years. I dont know why when I was just sleeping he tried to forcefully kiss me whenni denied he told me that he loves me. At that time I was not prepared niether I know wt to do. He took that that as my acceptance n started playing wid my body.
This become the every day ordeal for me... I didn't liked that but I was too afraid to share this wid my parents too. Gradually he started fucking me n getting his cock sucked too .
This happend till I passed my 8th class and tgen he went to different city for further studies. Earlier I used to like girls also but after that incident my orientation totaly changed.
He is living his life happily n got married n here m fucking living alone. I can get many person here who looks for sex but no one to love. Sometimes I ask God why only me..
It could have been better that I was not gay atleast I could have married a girl chosen by my parents n live my life happily. But now here m living my life toaly alone.
Sometimes whenever I go to public place I see couples walking together keeping hand in hands, having lovely talks.. this breaks me from inside.
I just want to tell everyone out here its nothing wrong to be gay but if a child is still straight then elders should not indulge wid any child abuse coz I think if wid me that child abuse was not done I could have been straight.
I respect lgbt n I know m a gay but I want to come out as gay to my parents family n society and this is only possible if I get my trustworthy partner. Then only I can face the social stigma.
Sorry for the long confession but I wanted to tell u my story.. love u all...</p>
<h1>GCI- Hearing stories like this makes me feel sad. Why do we have to depend upon others to end the social stigma or to wait to give us our rights? Its high time that we all as a community stop feeling sad for ourselves and fight tooth and nail for our rights.</h1>
