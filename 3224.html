<p>There is this amazingly good looking guy in my class but he is kinda immature mentally. As a child he was raped on a daily basis by his servant that probably lead to his mental condition. He once narrated this and told me he kinda started to like the anal part. He said he did enjoy it. I was jokingly trying to make out with him once and gradually I did seriously make out with him. He told me he is not much into making out, kissing and shit but he wants to be penetrated and do the same. I said I got fissures and there is no question I am allowing him to enter, which is so true. But then he said alright you enter me. And then I started to look for the Durex condom pack I had in my cupboard but I couldn't find it. So I declined. It would have been my first time. The guy was really furious and wanted me to enter him unprotected but I was too wary. He is so amazingly good looking with milky smooth clear skin, six packs, rock hard biceps and shit. Even the girls here got hots for him. So so so outta my league! :p
Sooo gonna buy a new pack asap! Don't regret my decision. Just hoping I get lucky again soon! I never thought my life could get so much Masala in it! ^*^ :p</p>
<h1>GCI- Good... protection is must. And at the same time show some passion towards your rights as well. -_-</h1>
