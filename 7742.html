<p>Iam just 17 , i feel for my friend ,who is a girl actually. We talk alot share our thoughts(she doesnt knw anything about the extra curricular activities im into nw). Even though i imagine to hav her as my partner, we r frm two different states two culture all that fun but i knw her answer. She wnt say a yes to me. I just dnt want to loose her.
Actually at that time(high-school ) i was completely unware about the concept of gay and homosexuality. Actually gay thing is stereotyped into a word'' chakka'' in india, its high time that sex education should b taught with regular lessons at school.
Last two years met many girls didnt felt that connection,actually i was not looking for one due to some other issues. Then one day during random porn i was introduced to the gay sex , it was shocking fr me for the first time i watched. But i started enjoying them nw. I dnt like the anal sex part.
I started meeting guys just to explore their world out of curiousity. And then i was into it, i kissed 3 guys got sucked by 2 and i haven't sucked anyone. I leave in the middle , i feel sry for the other guy fr ruining his pleasure. Im really confused i knw i dnt hav any future with my high school friend but still i feel fr her .
Im confused,but sex relieves loads of stress out of me</p>
<p>Brother dost post any of these ha , i just wanted to open up to somebody...so i told u everything. I feel better nw , n i decided to b an achiever, yup i knw nw wat i want to b</p>
<h1>GCI- Good for you! It's good that you are trying to figure it all out. But listen carefully. You are still very young. 17 is hardly better than 12. You have to give yourself some time. You have to give the people around you some time, and you have to give your relationships some time. I hope it becomes easy for you. It's gonna be hard, but it will be worth it.</h1>
<p>Ps- In either case, wrap it before you tap it.</p>
