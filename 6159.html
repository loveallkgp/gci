<p>I'm in my 20s, male, gay and a student at university.</p>
<p>I recently met a guy through craigslist for a date-hookup, with no pictures exchanged. I'd say he was fairly good-looking. We went all the way back to my place and then he excused himself saying he wanted to meet a friend nearby. He left and didn't call or come back again. Well, I realized he was a douchebag from the start when he lied to the security of my place. If he had any problems, he could have just told me the moment we met.
Of course, the ones who directly reject you on dating or hookup sites after looking at your pictures (which incidentally happens a lot) are way better than this guy. But anyway, it did hurt my self-esteem a bit, and I have lost all confidence regarding my body and appearance. I even posted my picture on
http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/ and unanimously got an 'ugly' vote.</p>
<p>A few years ago I never really used to care about my physical appearance as much. I realized we are trapped in a shallow world where the ugly, or apparently repulsive people are sidelined, pushed into the dark and the glamorous, attractive ones rule our minds.</p>
<p>Anyway, feels like dating - or hooking up with somebody - is not for me.
For  me, I suppose this is a serious problem - as it has a taken a huge toll  on my mind recently. Need to cope up with this. Suggestions and opinions are welcome.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm well have you ever heard about Adonis golden ratio of the body or the golden ratio of the face of human beings???</h1>
<p>If not then read about it...u will understand much better...
Now your self esteem stuff....dear UGLY people are beautiful if they have beautiful hearts and BEAUTIFUL people are always ugly because either they are the subject of sexual mongering or use and throw toys.One more thing Beautiful men in general are more selfish as proven by a survey....And lastly if you are not satisfied with ur appearance then make it better for urself &amp; not for others..bcoz 
"Beauty of the inner self is an elixir forever".</p>
