<p>Not an actual confession.</p>
<p>In India, society still mocks gays, effeminate boys, anything that does not seem normal and straight to them (people still believes being straight and acting straight as the only normal thing, and thats bad).</p>
<p>So Sushant is representing gays in the show. The way he behaves definitely leaves a bad impression of gays to our society that already does not support gay (taking into consideration what I already said about the definition of normal in our society). 
If a good looking (Sushant is, of course) and a very manly guy (again the definition) represent gays in the show, I believe that the acceptance and the impression of gays would have been better in the society than being represented by an effeminate guy.</p>
<p>(I am not against girly guys or gays or bi or anyone. But I am just saying according to the acceptance level of our society. Myself a bisexual here)</p>
<p>btw, the admin has been acting very immature regarding Sushant. ;) peace</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh honey, if I were acting immature, then I would never have been posting this.</h1>
