<p>I am in a relationship with a guy last 6-7 months. We love to each other. He is sweet n polite natured guy but sometimes when he is angry with somebody, he has value for that buddy. Nobody can change his mind. He is the person that he is fully dedicated for those people whose are most valuable for him but he has no value for same people in the case of his angryness. Sometime I am very afraid what will be our relationship In future ? Whenever in the future some problems have been created between us then he definitely will dump me from his life :( . I m very scared about his so deep nature. What i do ???? </p>
<h1>Viv- Two words.. "Anger Management". He will make the worst mistake if he will leave the one dear thing in his life because of some minutes of unworthy anger. Also, if he is the angry one, you be the sane one. Try to calm him down whenever he gets angered. A few romantic talks can melt anyone.</h1>
