<p>20 M,
A'chal P.</p>
<p>Manu, if you're reading this.</p>
<p>I'm still wondering y would u do this to me? Let me knoe, so tht I can knoe if it's worth still hoping that one day, we could be atleast be friends, bcoz we clearly are not., and it's clear that you're avoiding me for the reason best known only to u. I knoe we haven't known each other for a long time but my love for you was SO strong, and I was never in love with sum1 else as much as I was with you. I spend endless days and nights thinking about you. I usually don't go a minute without thinking about you or seeing you in my mind. At first, I thought you would be different among all these guys. For a while you made me feel as though I actually meant something to someone. But and but all my perceptions were wrong, everything was just a BIG Lie. Now, I hate realizing that the person who meant so special to me didn't felt even a fraction of emotions that seeped within me. It hurts to be torn between so many emotions. It might have been so much fun for you to play with those emotions. You decievd my heart. But you know what, if you get through a heartbreak, you can get through anything and I 'm sincerely gladful to you Manan for ending up like this with such a beautiful gift, a lesson much. And in return to all this I would pray and wish for you that No other Manan meet you in your way who would Just play up with your emotions.
Stay happy and kip loving yourself.
~Yours (pretended) Buns ( and I hate this name by now.)</p>
<p>P.s : OF ALL THE LIES YOU SAID TO ME.. 'I LOVE YOU WAS MY FAVOURITE ONE '</p>
<p>I miss those sketches, thumbkisses and the most the silly POuT of yours.</p>
