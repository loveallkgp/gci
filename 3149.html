<p>This was something that happened around 4 years back, I was new to my college and it was my first time out of home and that too very far [48 hours journey]. In the college I found a guy who was from a neighboring city of my hometown and we got close since we spent so much time together. We ate out together, watched movies, discussed girls [He genuinely, I faked], studied etc. However w/ time I started feeling emotionally for him and so far I had kept my gay emotions to myself. I had forced myself not to indulge in anything emotionally but I could not help myself. I started trying to touch him at different occasions, intentionally entered to his bed, though he did not mind considering he was straight, stared at him while he changed his clothes. I got a sense that he judged my feelings but never changed his behavior nor tried to take advantage of me. One year of college passed just like that and we went for internships. When we returned the next trimester, I found out within 2-3 days that he has made a girl friend in his internship. This shook me a lot. And without no fault of his, I started hating him. I tried to find minuscule reasons to pick a fight with him like he has cheated on me or something, which frustrated him a lot but he always tried to calm me down and keep my friendship. But I don't know what entered my mind then, I started maintaining my distance from him. He was a kind of loner, so he hardly had any friends except 2-3 of us. However I had a wide circle of friends. Slowly we stopped talking and he never made an attempt to talk to me too. He mostly wandered alone in college and I somehow had a pleasure seeing him alone like that while my friends galore. While we were departing from college after convocation, he left a note on my pillow and apologized if he had done anything wrong and requested me to forgive him. By the time I got the note, he had left and never got a chance to talk to him. He is on my friends list even now and invited me to his wedding as well [to the same girl]. But I could not dare to go nor I have a courage to talk to him now. I feel so bad at times that I lost a really good and genuine friend out of jealousy and immaturity. Worst part of it all is that I can not tell him why I did what I did to him. I am so relieved I could share this with a group of people who probably can understand. Thanks for reading this. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay Judas, he wasn't at fault and still he apologized. Doesn't he deserve an explanation? The burden of your situation is so bad that I think that it will be too heavy to carry for the lifetime. You owe him an explanation. Confessing here wouldn't do any good. He HAS to know, everything.</h1>
