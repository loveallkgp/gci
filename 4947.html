<h1>GCI- Be like you both have a different life and there are times that you don't want to be in each other's space. Your friend has got a girlfriend so you his time needs division. It's not that big of a deal. Just stop your expectations and be there for him when in need. It's good that you care but when the person is not showing any response when you are in need, he is then taking you for granted. So just respect each other's space and stop expecting.</h1>
