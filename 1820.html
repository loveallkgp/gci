<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Its more a question then a confession. if you know the answer please let me know. Thanks</p>
<p>I was broken-hearted. I sat on my bed with tears streaming down my cheeks.
My seven year old niece tugged at my pajamas, asking me why I was crying. I quickly wiped my tears away and faked a smile.
"Yes sweetheart, tell me what did you want to ask?", I asked her since she had a textbook and pencil in her hand.
"Chachu, is there life after death?" she asked, rolling her eyes like only cute little kids can.
I smiled a genuine smile this time. Kids are wonderful, I said to myself. They have this uncanny knack of making things better.
"No baby. Death is the end of life as we know it. Everything else is superstition," I explained to her.
She thought about it for a minute. Then as expected, she asked her follow up question.
"Chachu, is there life before death?" she asked.
"To this question, my precious, even I do not know the answer," I replied</p>
<p>$ABBY : those are some wonderful words and had me thinking ' is there life before death' ??</p>
