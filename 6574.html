<p>Hi friends,
I want to say something which I could not say with anyone in real Life. Actually I am a girlish BoY. Do u know our life is how complicated?
Actually I was graduated two years ago, But I m unemployed till now. Due to this I can't even servaive in society. Due to my girlish act and voice tone, all friends always tring to iGnore me. How can I change myself? I want to go away from this society, I can't handal all this.
.

<p>.with feeling confused and sad.</p>
<h1>GCI- You cannot escape the society and you cannot escape yourself. Forces around you will always try to bring you down. Just get better and not bitter. You can start working in those companies which are LGBT friendly, like airtel. You can start as a customer care executive. A friend of mine used to work there and there was another gay guy and a trans lady who were his colleagues. The more you fear, more difficult it is gonna be for you.</h1>
