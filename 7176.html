<p>Hi der, I'm HIV Positive pls update my confession it's important to everyone in gay world as well for me.</p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I'm 23 from Pune i have been  diagnosed with HIV on 29th Dec 2015. I had sex with a random guy we met on grinder he told, he wants to be in a relationship with me and was handsome. I'm bottom and was desperate 4 sex and not for relationship I cleared it to him, he accepted and we did had sex on 9th Nov. I'm sexoholic and desperate but I'm aware about the disease and so I had condom for safety measures. we boozed that night I never did b4, so I wanted to try it. I was so high and he was a regular and used to all this weed thing. I told him to use condom thrice as I was so high that I couldn't just check it as I didn't trusted him but I wanted to have sex, he started smooching me harshly which I didn't like. He stoped some time while having sex I don't know y, but he was doing something with his dick I don't know whether he was removing or putting the condom after that night I didn't contacted him and neither did he. because that was the most horrible night of my life i felt as if he was going to rape me and then kill me as if he didn't had sex from long time.. all I know is that basterd, SOB, MF he knew that he was infected and he gave it to me.</p>
<p>Since 29 Dec I'm alone and frustrated, didn't told to my parent's yet, please help me I don't wanna loose my self I have done a mistake I shouldn't have boozed that night please i beg u all reader's don't spoil ua beautiful life for such useless thing's u'll regret it until ua last breath.</p>
<p>If someone who's HIV + please mail me I'm terribly disturbed and need to understand about the disease.... request you to mail me on Rohanraaj58@gmail.com
Awaiting for ua response.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all a big hug from our side for coming out with such courage and sanity to talk about it and getting tested. Now listen to me very carefully.</h1>
<p>Being HIV positive is NOT the end of life or something gravely wrong if it happened by an accident.
UR mental state is more important than ur physical state now because HIV is NOT the end of u being fabulous.
Its like any other disease like fissures or diabetes, and u will be on life time medication just like those diseases and nothing else will change.
Now be extra careful when u catch a disease and that only will suffice.
There are celebrities with such positive status and they are happy, healthy and contended. LEARN THIS FROM THEM.
Watch documentaries of people living with the ailment and u will understood that life is better understood if we go through the deepest of the soul and our attitude must be more positive and realistic hence from now onwards.</p>
<p>STOP HATING URSELF ....for any reason because now u are in the position to guide more people than u ever did.
BE THE BEACON of light and hope.
For u specially-
Khud ko kaid karna to har ek ko asaan ko sikhaya jata hai...kabhi apne paron ko dekhne ki koshsish kar k dekh....tujhe udta dekh kambakht zamana jal khaak ho jaega!</p>
<p>Love from our side.</p>
