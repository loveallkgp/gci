<p>TO,MY SPECIAL FRIEND...</p>
<p>I don't know why I am writing this but I am writing it because every time I see U... I fall short of words to express what is hidden inside my heart which now beats faster when it hears ur name everytime....Exactly a month ago i spoke to u virtually....and it was at that very moment that i felt carried away when u conversed with me....The date 12 of DEC on which we first met is now one of my memorable evenings....not because i saw u but I felt u in words...gestures...ur sweetness and in ur smartness...U are one of the funniest person I have met yet again....Do u know that you have one of the most beautiful eyes that can make anyone go insane???When u sat on the bench with me on our first meeting..I couldn't take my eyes off from u....and yes u r indeed very very beautiful....both from the inside and the outside..Beneath that lamp post and on that cold bench where u mimicked me...that place and that time is priceless...thank u for that precious moments....And thanks for that starry night in your room where our intimacy made us understand ourselves better(the ceiling had false stars and moon).....I don't care what the people would think of the word 'intimacy' here...because for us sex was never an agenda or A BIG THING...How amazing it was to hold u or even to eat with u in the same plate and to cuddle u whole night and yes to feel that passion too...how two guys could sleep so perfectly in each other's arms.....MY heart poured out when i saw u sleeping...bt didn't dare to cry so that u might not wake up or get disturbed bcoz u had caught cold and had a headache afterwards....how soothing it was to massage ur forehead and make u sleep like a baby....god u were adorable!!! The way u saw me when i left and the way u dropped me to the metro station sitting behind ur scooty was all so dreamy....I couldnt have asked for more...I dont know what the future holds for us or how can we be together...or we would be together as such or not but yessssss....I do have made a very special corner for u in my heart and no matter what happens I will never be able to forget u and if destiny allows I WILL HOLD YOUR HAND AND WILL ASK UR PARENTS TO GIVE YOUR HAND INTO MINE FOREVER and seek their blessings...I am not the guy who would sit back and accept the so called fate of gays....I know i am gambling with my life but there is no choice ..and i want to give in all what I have..I am not afraid to die for my love...I know what mature love is...Destiny brought us together....and I would always pray that u get the best of everything and dare u cry after reading this......Ur eyes are NOT meant for tears....they are just meant for love....</p>
<p>YOUR SPECIAL FRIEND...</p>
