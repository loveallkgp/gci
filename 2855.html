<p>Hi I'm 18 and i want to share my short story. when i was 16.
A transfer came to our school and he was in my section. He was good looking , a little skinny and very fair.
The seat next to mine was vacant so we he was placed next to me. we became friends and Everything was normal for some days after a month or so, he invited me to a drink. and so we went out and drank from a club it was then he held my hands and took me to the bathroom and he started feeling me and telling me he loves me and stuffs and so we started kissing and sex happened.
the next day at school i was so nervous after what happened and so skipped class and to my surprise he called me and told me he bunked class cause i wasn't there and told me to come over
since then we've been happily in a relation and still we're happy and in love.
I love you babe. :*</p>
