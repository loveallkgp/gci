<p>Some. times I wonder reading post of gays, who r sex addicted, who say I want someone to Rape me,
though it may be a word for fun for them, but I feel they do not understand what pain a rape create in one s life,
 I was raped at an age of 16 by two guys, and you know for there shameful act I blamed myself for a long time, I stopped. going school strangely enough fearing to face both guys, though they have to be ashamed of what they have done,
years passed, and I still feel pain,
this incident affected my carrier, personality and life,</p>
<p>though now with time, I managed to live my life on my terms,
no shame I m a gay,
no shame I was raped due to physical weekness,</p>
<p>but y I feel a vacant space in my heart </p>
<h1>GCI : actually right . rape isn't a good term .</h1>
<p>specially after what happened in delhi rape case and recently what happened to women in lukhnow people have started using term rape as an adjective . like in cricket when one team wins others loses they say ' xxx team raped yyy team '. 
get it people ' rape ' term is in human . its a crime .those who have a fetish for rape really need to see a doctor . its called sick mentality . sex and rape are different things , understand it .</p>
