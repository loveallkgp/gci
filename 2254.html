<p>this is about one of my straight friend When i was in my first year in college.. i was a bit reserved. I had been bullied in the past and it was happening again Then I met a guy who was a perfect candidate for a bully. smart, intelligent(had a higher AIEEE rank), had that natural confidence. As expected he did tease me initially about my behavior though he would often act friendly. I tried to maintain distance from him to shield myself from barrage of terrible(for me) gay jokes he would make.
Anyways after first year we started chatting on facebook as his brother was in my class and we all would sometimes go out for dinner. Slowly we started to like each other's company. We would pull each others leg, we would share our problems and i would give him advice (and as we all know gays are excellent at giving advice)and he loved to listen to my advice. We would talk about life, politics , friendship, politics in friendship etc etc for hours. And very slowly we shared to each other our innermost fears and insecurities. He sometimes did hinted he pitied the fact that i was bullied for being different. and lets say i was myself in his company and felt comfortable. he too liked my companionship as he could discuss all his thoughts, insecurites, aspirations, moments of grief with me which he could do with his so called bro-friends ( common we are guys ! we dont discuss feelings).
Anyways the gay jokes continued, except that i now started enjoying them and making them myself. it was a significant part of our conversation. Finally i came out to him and he accepted me for who I am. the best part was Absolutely nothing changed in our friendship. We would still visit each other, go out for dinner and argue like crazy! infact it made our friendship even stronger! i laid bare all my deepest secret to him and he just lapped them up curiously and made it clear he sympathized with the LGBT cause . though gay jokes( in a lightful way)increased in both frequency and severity.. but he kept my secret. Nowadays he says Its vacations and i should totally lose my ass virginity in the summer !
So to all you cuties out there, There are some perfectly nice straight people too. They may appear to be harsh initially and anti gay (like this guy was) but you have to convert them and win their hearts by your honesty and friendship!
P.S The guy is totally straight! So dont go about making assumption about him
and this is a confession for god's sake! so dont go about judging and passing down harsh verdicts on me :) cheers!</p>
<h1>GCI- Exactly! Whenever you have a very good straight friend, try to reach their hearts and not their pants.</h1>
