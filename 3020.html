<p>good looking na hona duniya ka sabse barha apradh ha ye facebook par aa kar mehsoos kiya,</p>
<p>ek sadharan surat wale insaan se koi baat bhi nhi karna chahta,
mere post or comments parh kar ek boy ne mujhse roj chat karni shuru kar di, k I like u etc etc, fir ek din propose bhi kar diya,</p>
<p>maine us se kaha bhi k I m not good looking but wo bola, I want your heart not body or face, roj itni sheroshayri bejta, mere dil me wo bas gya,</p>
<p>fir bola k ek dusre ko dekh lete ha, mera uss se lagaav bahut jyaada ho gya tha, deeply in love with him, I sent him my pic, and suddenly he blocked me,</p>
<p>it was like a greatest shock, kya yahi pyaar tha, saara saara din ki chatting or proposal,
kya yahi tha jise mera dil chahiye tha ...</p>
<p>I wish to die </p>
<p>Translation- Its a curse to be not so good looking and I got to know about it on fb. I found a guy on fb and he got in contact with me. We started texting and he said i like you etc and then one day he proposed me. I said that im not that good looking but he replied that he wanted heart not body or face. Daily he sent poems and I fall for him. Then he said that we should see each other. I had deep feelings for him and it was love. When I sent him my pic he blocked me. </p>
<h1>GCI- That is why don't let the relations happen online. If you do want to get into one then get to meet each other as much as possible and then take things forward only if you feel compatible after some months. This is not a hard and fast rule but if you really want a stability, you have to plan things. Be open from the very start and lay down your expectations. Also, if you are not that smart it doesn't mean that you have to have less self confidence. It comes with your qualities and your achievements, not your looks.</h1>
