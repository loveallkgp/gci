<p>Hi friends this is in continuation to what I had posted earlier in this site. I once called an unknown guy (Name : Surender) in my home for fun and later he blackmailed me and escaped with my hard earned money. I could not report to the police as I don't have any faith in the police force in such matters. I was also afraid of social stigma. The risk element associated with meeting unknown person through networking sites is well known but we have a habit of falling into temptations to do sex with handsome guys. I request all community members to not call anyone in your home unless you completely rely on that person and know him fully. Guys I met that guy from a site called TOPIX DELHI GAY SEX. I have later interacted with several other guys from that site just out of curiosity. I am 100% sure that this site which I named here is filled with people with wrong intentions. They will contact you and then demand money and other benefits from you. They will humiliate you and can go to any extent to get money. I think these people are not one or two but they are operating in groups. I request you to not meet or interact anyone from that site. </p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm...so u landed into a shitpit..thanks for the concern dear....it really helps!</h1>
<p>And yes as I always say
LGBT is the same as any other straight asshole..stop categorizing us as ANGELS AND DEMONS!...</p>
<p>Next time go for decent people...even if it is paid sex!</p>
