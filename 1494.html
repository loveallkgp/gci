well...never believed love... but prev year..on fb..someone knocks the door of my heart..i was just saying no no no...and i got in love....we talk daily...hours...minutes nd evry second....i was crazy for him..though he was average looks but he just love him....after 3 months...he started changing...neglecting...ignoring me for no reason...yaar i hurt so badly...he just demand sex....and me demand love...he started cheating me...meine usko shod diya...one year guys..i cried...mein life mein kabhie nhi roya tha us bande ne literally made me cry......lost hopes...hate love...hate life and all....love naam ki koi cheez bhi nhi hoti thi...thn one friend come in my life....he show me some positive phase...i will say save my life.
Noe ek question tha.....can i love again....meine socha tha i can't...i reject countless proposals of guys...to which i feel very ashamed of being so rude....thn finally wo ayaa...my soulmate..my real love...meko ehsaas bhi nhi hua ke kab wo ek riend se meri zindagi ka itna khaas hissa ban gaya....No i proudly loves him...no sex lust at all....He is the most good looking heri type guys ever i have seen on facebook but it hardly matters...the most big thing that matters mee is his heart...so pure, so simple, so kind and full of love. I even can't believe that i got him. I feel am the luckiest here. My ex nd my present...kitna farak hai dono mein.....zameen aasman ka...SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS NEVER WAIT FOR YOUR LOVE...IT WILL COME AUTOMATICALLY DONT BE DESPO. AND SECOND LOVE IS MUCH PURE TRUSTWORTHY AND LOYAL BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT LESSONS FROM OUR PRECIOUS EXPERIENCES. Love can happen again. Just be ready to experience it.</p>
<h1>Viv- Of course. The more you anticipate, more depressed you go. All the best to you. :)</h1>
