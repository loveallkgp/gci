<p>Hello friends . I m a pure bottom and I swear trust me . I m not at all girly . I have girly thoughts like going out on a long drive sitting behind my man . Holding his waist . I have always dreamt of a man who is taller than me . With broad chest and biceps . Someone of a good background . Because belong to a well to do with family . Someone who is well to do with etc ... but u know what . All I get disturbed about is why do people think that I m girly when I m not . I don't walk like girls nor do I talk like them nor do I behave like them . But yes I do dream to get married in a family which is equally good and well to do with as mine .I too dream of a man who is more protective and possessive like a straight is for his gf .. I m confused . .. I m not confused about my orientation but yes I m contradicting my own state of mind and situation which I m in now .... the first situation is :- I m deadly not girly . Sorry to be rude . But I hate girly gays . And on second situation is .:- I dream of a man who is as possessive amd as protective as straights ... as well as . I do wish to get married with a man and have children like others ... .. I m a manly bottom with girly thoughts . Does that make sense ?? if not then what it is . But plz don't relate me to girly gays . But I m just confused</p>
<h1>GCI- May god give you what you desire. Atleast I don't have to post the hate on this page again. What do you get by being demeaning to others? Is being girly such a situation for you that your world will fall apart if someone calls you that? I know that it is your preference to have Johnny Bravo type of guy but do not SPEW effing hatred on this page. I hope I made myself clear. If you do, I will be happy to tap that ban button. Savvy?</h1>
