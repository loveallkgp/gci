<p>Hiii guys ...  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    It&#39;s a matter about a year ago . I had a fake account .... I had my real photos and my no. Posted there .. every thing was going well and I came new to Kolkata for my college . I was staying at my aunts place initially as i had no house of my own ... And there I was caught by my uncle ... as I had my real no. Posted on my fake account  . I used to get calls from strangers for relationships  .. an unfortunate  afternoon  I was at my fiesta . My phone again rang . It was an unknown no. My uncle answered the call as I was sleeping  , the person on the other side said &quot; m I talking xxxxx of fb &quot;  my uncle couldn&#39;t find who the xxxxx was he talking about so he said no . Again the phone rang the man on the other side asked again about xxxxx ( which is me , the other guy is dictating my fake name ) . My uncle being unaware of my fake account again he said no . Then the other man on the speaker said to my uncle that &quot;this no. Was posted by this Mr xxxxx ( which is me )  as he is a gay I wanted to bang his ass&quot; my uncle was stunned ... my uncle showered nice dialogs to him . Then my uncle fretted it to my dad who lives in another state . When he got to know the whole matter . He then asked my uncle  to investigate  ..... 
        My uncle asked a friend of his staff who is a hacker to hack my account to investigate .. the biggest secret of my life came out within a fraction of seconds . Few days after my dad came to Kolkata for my admission purpose . He was observing me by holding me  back from meeting my gay friends as I was unaware of the  fact that he is acquaint with my secrets . He then started spying on me and finally he took me back to my own state without letting me know about the whole matter .. 
       He then with tears in his eyes and shame on his face that his son is a gay . He said  everything to me how he gotto know that m a gay ... but what story my dad told me was different from the reality . My dad said that &quot; there are police men running behind me as I have been caught violating  the law , terms &amp;  rules and regulations of facebook ... so he had to abduct me from Kolkata in order to bring me out of this gay world &quot;. But originally my fake fb account was only hacked by a hacker there was no police case or cbi case charged on me IT WAS JUST A STORY ...  he held me back in my own state for a while like a month or two .and then again he brought me back ... month(s) spent in my own state werent that easy to carry my life ahead with ....
       Mean while my dad snatched off my phone and never gave it back to me . All contacts were lost ... no internet facility was given for even more few months after I came back to Kolkata .... and finally my dad brought me to Kolkata ... and now m happy ....
</pre></div>


<p>I KNOW I m cheating on my parent's feelings . But the fact is just that I m a gay . And I can't help getting my self attracted to guys . Whenever I remember my past . A fear burns my brain .. what if he gets to know that again I have opened an account .. what if he catches me again  .... I KNOW I have moved on and I m strong to say face this world .... peace .....</p>
<p>$ABBY : this story is totally made up  . how come you know what stranger was asking to your uncle as you were sleeping at that very time .</p>
