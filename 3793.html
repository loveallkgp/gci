<p>Hello Fellas!</p>
<h1>Anvay malhotra here..</h1>
<p>Its been 2 years n some months since I am here..
Have experienced too much..of the so-called feelings.. I dont want pity or kinda sympathy from anyone.. But jus wanna share them..
2 years back I was jus a moron.. moron about everything.. not only gay world but bout how to deal with people.. I used to trust everyone and very soon.. used to fall for guyz with either charming nature or very cutie face.. 
I have been in love.. i have undergone those feelings of love too.. a nice but very short relationship(2 months) but with a very tragic end.. I have undergone the Pain of heartbreak..after 1 and 1/2 year of breakup...
I still love my ex.. n we r still very good friends.. though its hard being just friends.. but still we r managing.. coz at the end in the hearts of hearts we both know that we love each other truly..n i am happy with this feeling..
I dont comeup with my feelings very easily infront of anyone.. smiling in every condition is my mantra..
But at the times I do feel very lonely, very lonely coz even in my real friends.. I do have only fake friends.. I never share up with them too.. jus like packed up myself in a closet..
I never had  that Guy friend to whom I can share up all myself.. that chaddi buddy with whom you can laugh with, jiske sath bus m real rahu..ghumu firu jo mere sath rahe humesha .. aur apni problems bhi share kr skun.. in college too..when i see guyz i feel worst..
even in my group mere alwa jo do guyz h wo best friends h humesha ek dusre ke sath rehte.. but me.. m all alone..  i feel messed up!
i do have a best friend but he lives very far.. in lucknow.. (fb friend) ..
I live with my family but its like i am living in a P.G. coz after i messed up my board results n other results after 12th my family has distanced themselves from me.. har wqt shakk krte rehte n inni boundations..
still I try to indulge myself in activities so that i can forget that last session of my school life 2012-2013.
Here Now I am the admin of the India's biggest gay group .. I feel Pity when I see people posting about their life partners like this as if posting an ad.. i feel hurt to see thre is so much sexgreed in people.. No one thinks beyond that.. no one becomes serious..
we on one hand ask for our rights.. and on the other we r ourselves making shame!!
Areee isse better to Sushant H banda kesa bhi ho.. atleast wo fattu to nahi.. samne to h.. hum humari society ke dar se.. lonelineess ke dar se or na jane kis kis dar se sabse door rehte h..</p>
<p>U know.what.. i have suffered a lot.. a lot.. struggled at every point of my life even for the little things to b done.. u can say my fate is not tat good.. I tried to go for relationship with some other guyz too but nothing worked out ever.. at the end suffering is what remains in my destiny..
after all this , I got changes in myself.. yaha dekha kisiko bhi serious banda ni chahie..everyine wants funny guy..kuch achi achi batein kro.. unhe hansao.. thats it..
At times people try being oversmart too.. but they forget samne wala agar unse bat krra h to inna bewkuf to wo b nhi..</p>
<p>N to all people who have lost hopes for finding their match.. and to the ones  who are on some kinda project mission of SEARChing!!
Dude.. love dhundne se ni milta..  love kahin post krne se nhi milta.. love.. i love you kehnse nhi hota. na hi meethi meethi batein krne se.. na hi sex krne se..
Love jab hona hota h..jese hona hota h n jisse hona hota h.. wo bus ho jata h..</p>
<p>Me too still waiting for my lOve.. for love to happen.. For someone to come and hug me.. for someone to not to end my sufferings but to caress me and be there with me in  my sufferings.. .
Bahot zyada ho gya..:P ending it..thanks for reading..:P
n yeaahh.. at last.. My age is 18.6 years..:P</p>
