<p>This might sound funny but I guess I'm in love. 
There's this guy I have been talking to. And since day two, he started saying he is in love with me and has developed feelings for me. I felt weird, bcoz I hardly know this guy. Generally many guys have said this to me, and I ignored them. But I don't know why, with him I couldn't help myself? 
Few things are there which I don't know like, I generally don't miss him, but I like talking to him. I like to share my every small activity with him. I was talking to him like a friend. A real good friend. But when he said," I love you", he ruined everything. I guess I have lost a friend. 
 I m not the guy with whom anyone would like to be in a relation. I know this. Secretly, somewhere I want it. But I don't know why im afraid of putting myself into a relation? Is it some kind of commitment phobia? Coz I have never been in a relation with anyone. And I never expected that someone's gonna say this to me. And finally when someone said that to me, im being such an idiot to take a step ahead and accept it. Why there's so much confusion in my mind? </p>
<h1>GCI- Yes I do smell commitment-phobia....Work on that!</h1>
