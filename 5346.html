<p>Hey there people.........
Im a regular reader of this page..... I get to read realy very inspiring stories and good stuff....
XD<excluding some> :P
Discussions on one or other problems which we all face at some or the point in our life are very helpful........
And the admin is a darling man :*
Hey dude im really a very huge admirer of urs......... :D
I just want to have ur wise words on a situation currently going on with me.....
I am bi... And so is my bf.. My first bf.... We are in a relationship since past 2 months we realy like each other.... But we both are sure that we are going to marry some girl in the future..... So dont u think our relationship is just a time pass we are just fooling each other as we knw we dnt have any future....... What do u think is it better to say good bye to our relationship and become frns or just let it go as it is going until we can manage???????</p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks for those kind words, darling.</h1>
<p>Listen babe, if you are bisexual, that doesn't mean that you have to go in a relation and then break up at the later stage just because you want to marry a girl. Being a bisexual means you are open to both sexes and can settle down with either of them. That's my definition of a bisexual person. Of course it can change from person to person. If you are in a relation and it's not something worth fighting for, then there is no use. What you guys have decided, it can be gathered that you indeed are just fooling around with each other. If you both are compatible and have that special bond, don't let it go by a thought of marriage. What if you cannot remain happy with your respective wives? Think from both sides. </p>
<p>Watch the video on the link.

<p>One guy was a straight or a bisexual but now he is committed with a guy and they are gonna get married soon. Love can really happen and it is beautiful if you fight for it.</p>
