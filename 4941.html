<p>Sorry admin if you're already sick of katju. I would like to know your views on his reply to some commenter who commented on his post of 'Science Vs. Religion'</p>
<p>He says that he is against criminalizing of gay relations but in his views they are unnatural.</p>
<h1>GCI- This katju is getting on my last nerve. He is just being a diplomatic grade 1 a-hole with severe attitudinal problem. He said that homosexuality is humbug. Next he says that he doesn't support criminalizing but calls it unnatural. Section 377 says that any sexual activity which is against the order of nature is a criminal activity. He is not clear on which position to stand. He has no particular explanation than his ridiculous ideology which is nothing but full of hetero-patriarchy and victorian mindset.</h1>
<p>People are either with us, or against us. There is no in between.</p>
