<p>Hi .. I don't know where to start from the story seems a big one and must be a frequent one for many with siblings.
I hav an elder brother . He was quite elder to me .So as a sibling I didn't interact wit him much of a sort . We didn't hav that sibling bonding except the fact that we used to talk . For all these years I lived my life on my own terms and rather alone in solace . It was last year vacation when my brother took a halt for a bit came here and was at our home for approx 3-4 months. Previously it had been for petty holidays .So I cud easily accommodate fr tat long period of tym since he intervened in my privacy . I m 18 and all I wanted was to be left alone .anyways moving on ...
The past 3-4 months were quite an eye opener to me of how my brother was sexist and even though he loved me , but never left any stones unturned to humiliate . Everything I did had started displeasing . He started calling effeminate in front of every one . He thought it to be a joke but he never understood how I felt . YES I know tat out of excitement I behave which myt be seen as girlish but it was never all the tym . I started crying coz that cud only giv me bliss and help me cope wit it . I also admit tat I liked acting as a girl during my early childhood bt did tat mean he wud taunt em everywhere.I wud also ask to u all is it justified tat all u get in ur lyf are such taunts and even wen u try to cope up wid them all u get is more mockery directed towards u ? ..is this brotherly luv or denial to accept the reality tat this is how I am . "Why isn't ur posture rye while walking" , " why are always walking lyf a girl" , " why do u listen to Taylor swift and Kasey musgraves " ," don't be lyf vj andy in future" .. these where the questions thrown at me and it still continues well wat will change within 8 months tat couldn't change in years . Is there any problem with me of how I want to live my life . Do I hav to please everyone around my society and do I hav to guide my preferences also to be according to their choices ? I sometimes feel tat such a sibling is only in my fate whom I loathe more than I luv . Things are better when we aren't together bt they get worse when we r together ..:(</p>
<h1>GCI- I am sorry that it all happened with you. But yeah, you don't have to please everyone around you. The more you try to please others, more you will loose yourself. Focus on your identity and work on your own betterment. People will bark. Let them.</h1>
