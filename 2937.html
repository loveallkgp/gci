<h1>GCI- Well there is a way but its darn expensive. Its called hair transplant treatment. But sometimes people can rock their bald look as well.</h1>
<p>But if your friend is really feeling awkward about it, ask him to get his head shaved a few times. It will make the hair go thicker and sometimes new hair can grow. Mustard oil can also be used for more hair growth. This one is a desi nuskha. If none of these methods satisfy him, ask him to rock the look from whatever he has left.</p>
