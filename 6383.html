<p>I want to share something its about the guy I met in January somehow through chats and he became one of the important person in my life . no he is not my boyfriend he is my bestfriend actually he was met through f platform only . I was so happy to have friends like him . He thinks like me he used to we have many similarities in our families relating to our sexuality . that's made us more strong and close to him .I think he is one of the those person who actually gave importance to me .like no ever  did . yeah see he is my best friend . I am from Delhi . so Delhi guys get this one better and others also too. There is a park in Connaught place of Delhi near gate no 7 Rajivchowk metro station . everyone what it is famous for gay crowd trans not good one. When I started visiting that park with him I told it's not  good place see people around us they do funny things . unavoidable things cheap . I saw guy sucking and pressing another guy chest .I was shocked but they think they rocked .I told them what r u doing in public one told me AAA ja yeh karu tuje woh karu .. Anyway that place is horrible ppl with unsatisfied wife roam to get young gays to take them home . I told him is not good . please we have to stop coming but I started visiting that place every Sunday with I hardly made any friends all u know are. I told him cuz I cared about him yeah one and half year younger I don't want him to do stuff through fake accounts and but he carried away ..we spend many good moments after three months he started saying u keep on getting angry . I was then bit u r pyscho  . he started explaining me then some bad words came out of my mouth slut . gay and mny other stuff .once he invited me there he is about to reach actually he was there but left me abondond in may summer so hot I was waiting for one and half hour crying over there he just left.</p>
<p>I was like blocked him he knows I can't do this forever blocking thing he started apologising . but after  some time we started fighting on reason what u don't treat ppl there right everyone knows u r this that . this is not my friend speaking because he knows what I am .  finally he silently before his birthday month he broke it from his side silently I was like beggar and tailor sewing our piece of friendship .I cared what I got . he cared about me too when I told him u r getting defame and stuff about such place and wasting money for such purpose I got loneliness . this is world see he came got me attached and shit .fucked up now . is nt see if anybody out here lile me emotional moron . u can visit me in hell . cuz I am alone .</p>
<p>I don't trust ppl easily I did him now .he said u r pyscho mad sorry I turned into this 
 See he is feeling pity.   frown emoticon . I am the one who used to gave willpower to emotionally weak ppl   .I laaughed with him not laughed laaaaaaaughheed .</p>
