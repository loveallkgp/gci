<p>Hey guys,
I have written confessions before and this is one more confession which is more of an experience than a confession.</p>
<p>I am 27 years old nd looking for a steady relationship. I have always been single coz of many reasons; so now i am looking for someone who can love me and be with for life.
Now if write similar lines on any gay social networking website say a PR or Grindr, i will be considered as a fool coz what majority looks there for is sex.
I happen to chat with a lot of guys, have wasted so much time on chatting or talking over the phone but somehow have never been able to take it to the next level i.e meeting them.
I am a little heavy as far as my weight is concerned and my pictures in PR showcase that and i have always made it clear with the guy that if he wants someone who is muscular, they can stop and move on; but still a lot of them hang on for some time.</p>
<p>Now the deal is how much time one should chat with someone before actually meeting them bcoz random chats for weeks not only waste ur time but it raises your hopes that he is the one. I have faced it many times and now it really pisses me to the core to chat with guys...</p>
<h1>GCI- Now onwards stop using gay dating apps and start to meet real gay people in real life with a lot more openness  and yes internet is the start but not the end of gay people available on earth for u!</h1>
<p>Still Two things from my side-
1- U don't need to feel incomplete just because the society says so.
2- U need to achieve the level of self-sufficiency through indestructible self love. 
P.S- Read the comment of ours on post no 6587 for additional advice.</p>
