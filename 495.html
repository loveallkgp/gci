<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>What had we done to deserve this life of such being? God made us Gays and made the society against us. If we don't take being Gay is normal, why wud v choose to be Gay and hated by the society? I am so much confused. I am from Bangalore looking for friends of my kind.</p>
<h1>Viv- We haven't done anything wrong to deserve this. Being gay does not mean that you are "less than" others. If you look at history, gays ruled the earth, gays were big confidants of royal houses, they were artists, musicians, engineers, war planners and God knows what else. Put it this way we are just simply above the so called mainstream people. We are as normal as everything on this earth. Nothing unusual, nothing different. But yes, we got some awesome swag. Eat this.</h1>
