<p>This is something many of us in FB do face sometimes .... u get a guy who keeps pestering you for your pics and number.... It happened to me few days back. I fell bad for the guy and gave him my number and pics. He started to madly msg me call me and asked me to be his bf. But I had read his profile which was full of sex posts. So I rejected, and he started threatening me by saying if i didnot have sex with him,  he will post my pics and number in FB .. and i will be doomed ...  many of the young guys get scared here in india and submit to diz ..... but i am not lyk them ... I said Fuck off buddy ...... I make the society not the other way around ..do whatever you want to..... blocked him and he hasn't dared to do anything after that! I feel so proud and happy   My suggestion to young guys dont ever agree to such cheap people, fight them and they will run away eventually. 
PS: Admin I love you </p>
<h1>GCI- Exactly! Try living scared and your life will be hell. Love you too confessor, for sharing this.</h1>
