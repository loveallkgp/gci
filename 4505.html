<p>Need some suggestions...
From childhood I liked guys and girls both... I thought that I was bisexual.. Bt after 18 I only attracted by girls and have sex with 2 girls..
Then when I was 20 I meet I guy actually he was my roommate.. (He is bisexual )
And we have sexual relationship for a year.. And I fall in love with him.... Now we are saprated from months due to some reason.. But I still love him....</p>
<p>problem is that ki Now less attract towards girls sexualy.. And I case of guys I attract toward them bt can't have sex with them ( I feel disgusting have sex with some other guy but if I got a chance with my roommate with whom I was in relationship then its okay to me).
I confused what going in my life..??
What the f**k I am?? Gay, bisexual or straight??</p>
<h1>GCI- Let me tell you about a mass spring vibration system. In this system a block of mass m is attached to the spring from both sides and the springs are attached to the walls on both sides. When the force is applied in either of the direction, the vibration of the block takes place.</h1>
<p>Now imagine that the walls are heterosexuality and homosexuality and you being the block vibrate between them.</p>
