<p>Am a 25 yrs old sanadya  brahmin gay and doctor as well , and I am not open right now , in 2-3 years family will start pressuring me for marriage of course , now assume your self in my position . if I refuse to get married , questions will be raised , even if I take my family in trust that I am gay and it will not be fair to ruin a girl's innocent life , but still relatives will not let live my family peacefully . "kahi gay way toh nahi hai sharma JI aapka ladka "  "illaz willaz karwa lo yaar agar kuch problem ho toh ".  these remarks would be made. And if I decide to come out of closet to world , what kind of treatment I will receive from my fellow doctors and patients , because every one is homophobic , it will practically ruin my career. People might advice me to marry a girl and leave behind every gay thoughts ( that just might happened in dr. Kamal vedi's case ) . and I might end up marrying a girl . so if I married a girl , and realized later that I am gay and marrying a girl can't change who I am. I will not be happy in my marriage , extra marital affairs would be unavoidable because of emotional and physical needs , and one day my wife finds out that I am gay and I ask her to give me divorce but plz dOnt disclose my secret as it will affect my carrier , but no she is of very traditional poor family and divorce is still a social stigma still in our society and everyone blames girl for that. So she instead try changing me , I get frustrated , I started torturing her so at least she would leave me , but no she would not take divorce , instead she suicides and leave me , my family , her family with all the troubles behind .  and no one from doctor priya vedi's family neither she herself accused dr. Kamal vedi for dowry , its police that made case with extra dowry section.</p>
<h1>GCI- Yaar....how much u overthink!!!! gawwwdddddd ...agar sab kuch hi pata hai toh yahan pe dil ka gubbar nikalke kya milega??babaji ka thullu??</h1>
<p>Sarcasm apart....what is the problem u being gay or u being closeted??If there is any (according to you they are endless) then remember three main things-
1- When u are truthful to urself u don't keep it with urself instead u share ur truth with someone u can trust ..this is how u come out....bcoz in that way it purifies our soul and our insecurities disintegrate..
2- When u dont even know that u r gonna live tomorrow or not then y such a halabaloo of your sexuality???Were u born to give explanations to each and everyone??
3- If you think that being closeted can make ur career bloom then pls be my guest and don't ever make a fuss about it...ur career is marked by your professionalism and not by ur sexuality..
Rest my fellow mates shall put it for you!</p>
<p>P.S- U will be blowing trumpets of ur sexuality to ur patients ????</p>
