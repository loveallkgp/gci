<p>Okay! So this is pretty fucked up, keep an open mind.
I'm gay and in my mid teens. So while I was sharing a bed with my brother(older), things got a little "handy". We smooched (EW,right? I blame hormones.) And one thing led to another and nothing much happened. Things were just a little "handy". Hands were literally involved and a bit of my mouth on his foreskin and a little below it. (Ew again, right?) It just happened twice over a period of a year and it was sort of, revolting.</p>
<p>Confrontation isn't my strong suit and I was equally responsible for whatever happened. Yeah, it sounds so WRONG. Restraint should have been maintained but the momentary impulse took over and I hate it.
Incest is just, ew. But there wasn't much of actual sex. Not justifying anything. I'm just conferring. And it sounds so fucked up. Glad to get that off my chest.
Now that it's out of my system. I guess I can go about being a little less dysfunctional.
P.S.- No judging, even you, admin(and especially no foreign language of any kinda, specifically French)! Everybody has deep dark secrets and messed up things and the anonymity of the internet just saves the money and will required to see a shrink. </p>
<h1>GCI- No one is judging you, boo. Atleast I am not. You both did it and only you.</h1>
