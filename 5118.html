<p>This is not a confession per se. But I just wish to thank to the Admin(s) for his suggestions. I have just recently started following the page and after all the posts, I realized life is not too bad actually.
So good luck to admin(s). You are doing a wonderful job
and to our community, I would like to say that Never lose hope. Be Confident and we all have it in us to be independent mentally, socially and materially. It's your life and if you can't love yourself, no one ever will and Remember, No one stays in your life forever, so you have to be your best friend.
I know it may sound too philosophical and at times impossible to follow, but at major times this independence will get to joy you can't achieve from anything in this world.
and After all this, I believe that our gay world in kind of mean (majority) and on dating sites, our most or sometimes only source to find 'partner', we find that in abundance but then if you are good, it does not mean you are alone, there are many others. Time and Luck will turn in your favour some day but till that time, do yourself that favour and Be happy. </p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks for the appreciation baby! And Amen to your words!</h1>
