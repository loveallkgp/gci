<p>hi everyone!
i'm 22 yo guy..I used to think I was 100% gay, and had very difficulty in accepting the same. after 7 years of mental struggle and hiding from society I almost accepted myself. I was attracted to guys, met few guys, had fun but nothing below the waist. I also fell in love with a straight guy and the last year was very difficult for me. I told him, he ignored me. everything was going fine, i was recovering from my "unrequited love". but lately i have been having dreams about girls, also i can't stop staring at boobs. it is all so confusing! is it just a phase? now gay porn repulse me. what is happening to me?
I sincerely hope i get my solution here, with you people doing such amazing job!
thanks</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, gay guys do have this phase of fantasising about girls for a brief period in their lives.</h1>
<p>U must understand the basic notion of being human first.
YES, u might be gay and fantasising or dreaming about girls in dreams or liking boobs because of entrenched patriarchy or simply because of ur mind being saturated of seeing gay porn...
Just like straight guys have man crushes, gays have them too and if it sustains for a longer period of time then u might be sexually fluid a bit.
U might have lived with a denial in ur life, and maybe now u don't want labels for the time being..its all natural and normal....
But remember 3 main things-</p>
<p>1- Sexuality may be fluid, rigid or maybe partially fluid at any given point of time in our lives.
2- Our basic sexual attraction remains the same during our entire lives....i.e If u like men entirely, u will not deviate from it, if u like women u will stick to that, if u like both then it is also alright.
3- But its not wise to take decisions about our sexuality when we are saturated, depressed, weighed down by patriarchal thoughts and notions and lastly its not ok to feel guilty if u r not gay, strt, or bi or whatever the tag is....</p>
<p>P.S- Once u understand what constitutes a phase and what constitutes reality on a long term basis, u will get ur answers accordingly.
And yes Boobs or dicks..whatever they are..they are good!</p>
