<p>My confession was 1508where I discussed about my feminine behavior . Most of the comments were not in my side.They think I can be bullied, can be tortured just because I am feminine. It's justice to do injustice on me.Same mentality like girls can be raped because for their apparel.Most annoying messages I got were ....he is a boy how can he act like girl?or another one recommend me voice therapy and some tips for walking. List goes on..I get to know there is so much hatred present in my own community. Someone recommends me to hang out with girly gays..Why can't I hang out with a straight acting gay guy.?what's the difference between me and a manly gay?..why am I untouchable in my own community? If my own community can't accept me..should I ask for other acceptance? .......I want to thank Abby for his kind words.....my english is not good </p>
<h1>Viv- I read your confession thoroughly and let me tell you one thing, never let ANYTHING or ANYONE treat you in a bad way. Let it be your family or your teacher. Learn to complaint about the injustice right in the face. Do not care if they are your elders or teachers. If they were any understanding they wouldn't have done those deeds.</h1>
<p>Moreover you must not depend upon anyone for your acceptance, You have already seen enough of it. But you must accept yourself the way you are. ANd as far as some people in the community are concerned, discrimination will always be be there. you cannot change it at all. Just accept the fact and do not go with the wrong sort. Say like, "Yes i am girly. If you have a problem with that just go away. Don't waste my time." When you show this much of confidence, the person will himself feel that he can't ridicule you. Just like abby said there, make a career and get settled successfully, then no one is gonna care whether you are girly or not. People still like karan johar and go to see his movies. Lastly, know that you are an amazing human being and you have seen the ground level. Rise from the ashes like a phoenix and show these people that you cannot be hurt anymore by anyone.</p>
