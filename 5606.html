<p>hii
A weird thing happened to me today. i was waiting for a bus suddenly an old uncle wd a kid was there stairing at me .uncle was very strange he kept on laughing and making some kind of faces i ignorned i went away he followed me. suddenly my phone rang i picked the call . that uncle at midway holded my hands pushed me towards itself i was shocked i cuted the call i said whats wrong with you . he said dont get scared off me i said uncle get off me he replied abe gandwe koi na i felt so bad that bloody uncle used such harsh words for me without even knowing me i pushed him away and said tera baap hoga gandwa and i ran. after 5 minuted i realized that uncle did bad to me and i didnt have the courage to retaliate. i moved towards the uncle with intention of kicking his testicles but he was with his friend i again lost my courage but i abused him twice mene use punjabi style mein gali di bari bari. he got panic and ran towards me to beat i ranned away from that place .god saved me today. i got so scared . i didnt even know who was he and he tried to pushed me towards himself and literally tried to do something with me .wish god had been more kind towards us. but god always shows his kindeness towards cruel people. i wish that bastard uncle shuld get punished one day</p>
