<p>Hey GCI...
You guys are doing really a great job... 
Here I want to share one problem hope you guys will help me...
I tried alot to keep the things on their places however cuz of my life's more problems I was unable to tackle with them any more so thought of getting a help from you guys... hope you guys will help me.. </p>
<p>Its like me(20 years) and my BF(19 years) went in relation and I asked him to deactivate these fake accounts but he said he will not as his friends are here...
I trusted him and agreed and we started to live a happy life... </p>
<p>then one day he told me that he have crush on a guy and that guy is straight and know everything about my BF(that he is from LGBT) and that guy wanna have sex with him, and as a BF I asked my BF not to meet him however still my BF went and met him and my BF told about the casual meeting after 2 days of their meeting. we had a quarrel, I asked my BF to quit talking to that straight guy he quit and we were living a happy life... </p>
<p>then one day I asked my BF about that straight guy and my BF sent his one pic(he kept it when I said not to keep) and I got angry I asked him for all his pics he was having and then I uploaded all his pics on my fake FB account just to check the reaction of my BF... </p>
<p>and my BF's reaction was: according to him that was the cheapest stunt I ever can do and he broken up with me...
However I expected that My BF will be with me no matter whatever happens but he was with that straight guy... :( </p>
<p>and we started to live our lives separately... </p>
<p>I begged him for relationship one day but he kept a condition that he will never ever trust me again and he will never ever let me touch him, and asked me if I agree then he can continue, this made me think again about my relationship with him that he really love me ?(as he was keeping such conditions)</p>
<p>however we were in love and we use to talk as a friend but use to say I luv you to each other and Love was their between us.
as we were in long distance relationship and because of our break up I was feeling very much broken and I met a guy in between and we became very good friend and we had sexual relation..</p>
<p>but now when My  BF want to be back, with my purest heart I told him that yeah I did a Mistake and will not repeat it and He said okay if at all we had a quarrel again and then he will do the same and I will not say anything rather I have to accept it, I said okay I will do... </p>
<p>Then I asked him to deactivate and then we can start again(as already this account have fucked our relationship very much) but still he don't want to deactivate his fake account... </p>
<p>what should I do??
Is this love or just an attraction as We are not thinking of being together rather we are having a cold wars keeping different conditions.</p>
<h1>GCI : do you guys really think you two are in love . NO !!</h1>
<p>he wants to have sex with straight guy and you had sex with somebody knowing that ... what your relationship has gone through .</p>
<p>i think you guys like each other as friends and like the company but that doesn't mean you two have to be couple . </p>
<p>i mean come on .. you have found a guy in gay world ( can you believe this) but still you are banging other guys . and its not about fb accounts ... you can have relation and keep fb too.  but trying to bang other guys during relation isn't love. its insecurity or just a formality .</p>
