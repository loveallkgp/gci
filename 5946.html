<p>Some preposterous arguements put forward for legalising homosexuality-
1. It is observed in animals as so is perfectly acceptable. ( Cannibalism, predatory behaviour and forced sexual behaviour is aslo seen in those cases would u want the same to be applied to humans? Are you a human or an animal not in strict taxonomical terms)
2. It is perfectly acceptable in Indian culture as paintings and sculptors in some temples endorsed it. ( well the morals of society and indian cultural sentiments cannot be decided on a sculpture.)
3. It was the british who made banned so the ban should be lifted once they have left. ( the British banned murder, sati, and a million other crimes would you legalise them too)
I understand your bona fide concerns people but just think of better and sound reasons </p>
<h1>GCI- Uh uh honey now listen closely. these arguments are given when straight people come up with dumb reasons to ban homosexuality.</h1>
<p>1) Even animals know who to do it with and we are smarter than them.
2) It's not a part of our culture and it never happened.</p>
<p>This is what you illogical people say at first.</p>
<p>Now you can have a whole chain of questions and answers and arguments and other blabbity bleh over and over, the fact remains that we are here and your ignorance cannot push us in the closet again. Forget the animals, forget culture, sculptures and paintings, do you really think that making someone's life miserable and not letting them live is very human of you? What good does it do to you? </p>
<p>And as far as what british banned, the latter practices were inhumane, whereas homosexuality is not. So next time you come up with some arguments, make them logical and get the analogies of the same level. </p>
<p>We don't have to give the reasons for our existence. We are here, that should be enough for you. Moreover if you had really understood the concerns, you wouldn't have come up with such lame points. Think of better and sound reasons and please, don't let them be about reproduction. It got old, wrinkly and is lying in the coffin.</p>
