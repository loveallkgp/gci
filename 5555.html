<h1>5546 confession Further question GCI The guy always intentionally try press my moobs he abuse me with his friends what to do I want to take this matter to teacher or authority I want to solve this with them u tell me how to go ahead plz</h1>
<h1>GCI- Agree or not but that is a serious sexual assault on you. Just go to your HOD or any other higher authority and say, "i am having a problem with one of my peers and the matter is a bit big solve on the same level. As a student who pays for the education to this esteemed institution, I expect a safe study environment."</h1>
<p>If he says anything that you can solve it with him by talking, "I am a guy, that doesn't mean that I cannot be helped. If something like this had happened with a girl, things would have been different. Immediate action would have been taken." Be confident in whatever you say and do not victimize yourself.</p>
