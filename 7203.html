<p>"This isn't a confession..  so, don't read..<br>
This is for every readers here who are feeling alive but is dying inside..<br>
I find it so weird actually why its difficult for others to be happy and live their life so simply as how they want it to be..  We're all challenged. all of us experienced heartaches.. all of us we're betrayed.. judged and misunderstood.  It's life! what's important is how we learned, grew and lived..<br>
Try to think that not everyone is as lucky as you are. That somewhere out there someone is looking up to you and is inspired by you. That someone is wishing they are in your position. Hoping that they are like
you. Dreaming that one day you are together..  That YOUR LIFE really MATTERS to some people..<br>
Coz I for one is dreaming to have a life which all of you have lived. A life with friends. A life with parents. A life with a sort of freedom. Crushes thing, love lifes and nightouts..  I may not experienced love related problems but you just couldnt tolerate the psychological and mental effect of knowing that every day could be your last day on earth. 
Lovingly yours,
A happy Blood Cancer Patient
Thanks admin and you are doing a great job
God bless you.</p>
