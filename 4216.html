<p>I have a very peculiar problem. Actually I met one guy from Pakistan in UK 3 years ago, we soon got into a civil partnership and my study visa was then converted to a perenant settlement one. He said to me that he was gay and had no interest in girls at all. Everything was fine and I even bought a house for him in Kent. However one day I caught him having sex with my sister and was completely heart broken. I tried to resolve things with him but he was adamant on breaking up and now wants me to
leave the house that I bought for us. He is dragging me to court and wants mandatory injunction. Although I had paid all the money, the loans were paid from our joint account and so he wants to claim his rights in the house. </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, what does your sister thinks about you both? Anyways, this is really sick. Try getting a lawyer there and then work on it. All the best.</h1>
