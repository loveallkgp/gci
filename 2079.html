<p>disturbed Mind~
sometimes I think that being gay was written in my destiny like a stone carving...
I am closeted guy;I behave  Litte girly sum times ;I don't like sports Bt I play lil bit; I even watch some reality shows along with 1-2 tv serials..isn't it too girly even for a gay?
Bt m gud enough that no one can easily detect m gay;I get teased with names of many gals from my frnd;
the things is although I always tried to run from this world I catches me further.
At present ; I have started getting symptoms of low testosterone,not proven medically though,
I just don't know what my future is gonna be??? arrgh totally disturbed:\  ;</p>
<p>u ain't got balls ;fag; nobody uses these words on me Bt whenever I see such words it hurts :(
huh a pretty long one:D
Bt there is more to say and ask ;
maybe I have to make other one other wise this one will be freaking long...</p>
<h1>GCI : you know you are anticipating too much . ...  and if its not medically proven how come you can tell your testosterone level is decreasing . and even if it is that doesn't mean your estrogen level is increasing. testosterone level decreases due to many reasons , like depression can cause it or illness can cause it too.</h1>
<p>watchng tv shows and not playing sports doesn't make you girly or manly unless you are watching ' saas bahu' . that is complete girl stuff :P ( jokes apart ) :P . </p>
<p>darling in which age are you living ?? we are in 21st century and forget the worries coz sooner or later we getting rights . and don't be afraid to man down those bitches who ever call you names ...  stay strong ...</p>
