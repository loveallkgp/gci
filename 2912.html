<p>Ah well!!
An year ago I wasn't worried about it because I knew I was gay and infirtility didn't mean anything to me but now I'm concerned..
Umm, my testis are of different sizes and I guess they are bigger thn the average size.. Length approx 4 cm and the other one aprox 5 cm.. My bf came to my city and we went to a hotel. We didn't make out, we were just lying on the bed hugging each other tightly for hours.. At night I came back to my home, he still was in the hotel. When I was changing I touched my balls and they were hurting. The pain went away in the morning and they were fine.. I told this to my bf and he said 'it might be because of your jeans 'cause you had a boner the whole day.'</p>
<p>My cum isn't white. It looks a little translucent as if urea is mixed in it...
Is something wrong with me. Reproductive tract cancer or some infection? Or something like that.
PS :- I'm serious.. :/</p>
<h1>GCI : see i firstly thought it to be normal thing as so many men actually have bigger balls but when you mentioned that it hurted to touch it took my fair attention .</h1>
<p>i suggest you to see a doctor as soon as possible and talk to your parents too, if you aren't comfortable talk alone with your father , he can understand a man problem . these are some serious signs and should be treated . testicular cancer has signs like that but i am not doctor so see a doctor .</p>
