<p>Hi guys i am in relationship wd guy fr 3 yrs we love each other a lot i have told abt this to my family.they hv accepted me as a gay but are not happy wd the fact that my bf comes to my home and stay wd me at night.sometimes when my parents are out he comes and stays wd me for 5-6 days.my father is very society conscious and is not liking this thing at all but i want that he shd come to my place so that my parents accept him.my neighbors also suspect a lot abt me.So guys pls help me out in this regard.my father also says he will commit suicide if anybody in society questions abt my relationship wd my bf . I cannot leave my father also because there is nobody to take care of him.so staying wd my bf is not a option for me.Guys pls help me out in this regard</p>
<h1>GCI- If they accept you, they have to accept you fully and be proud of you. It shouldn't be 50%. Talk about your dad and your bf at the same time if possible. You can make him watch satyamev jayate also because it says a lot about parental accepting situation. You are family with him and with your bf as well. Its high time your family takes him as a part of family and be proud of you both. Your dad clearly care more for the society than his own family.</h1>
