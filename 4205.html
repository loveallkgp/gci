<p>I feel that porn should be banned across India as it is disgusting and grotesque. It also goes against the Indian culture I mean none of u guys really care about Indian culture but still. Apparently I have been award that a special category of pornography called BDSM exists which simulates violent behaviour and sexual gratification simultaneously. That is so fucking ridiculous.
Secondly i know this is irrelevant but Indian Society, Government and People are such fucking retards and scum's that on one hand they most deferentially accept a slutty porn star who does unnatural sex with a goodly number of men and women { Sunny Leone a bitch who ought to be relieved of the burden of her crown} and at the same time persecute a large number of transponders and homosexuals for not doing any felonies. I mean how silly is that serving an actor a legal notice for his meritorious and noteworthy actions and offering legal contracts of mercenary nature to a bisexual porn star. </p>
<h1>GCI- Stop using the world called indian culture for promoting bullshit. Indian culture gave us the biggest sex book called Kamasutra. So fuck you on that retort. Yeah, I am going personal. Problemo, el senor?</h1>
<p>Its transgenders. Ugh. Transponders are the combination of receiver and transmitter in radio communication antenna. </p>
<p>What a troll!</p>
