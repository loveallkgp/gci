<p>So people talk about gay equality, Tell me how much we respect each other? We alll are fake here including me ( not fake with ids) but fake with heart and nature :) .. So i send friend request to this guy , n jst after touching on button my cell got hanged and i thot req has not been sent :) i send him bcz he seems friendly with my mutual friends n m open to know new friends and we all know we gt very less friendly guys here n from his posts he seems to be really genuine and caring bout friends :/ thn i saw his very beautiful comment on this page and i gt impressed that guy is so caring so i check his profile n send him request wd a message hii. God swear i did nt knew that yesterday request was being sent to him n he ignored that! And he does not hv even his pic on profile so i did nt send req only bcz of his looks.So he replied hellow..i : can u accept my request if u dont hv any problem :) He : Cant u get it i hv ignored ur request yesterday . why u r sending it again and again? I : m really sorry i did nt knw request has been sent yesterday. chl bye tc He : u r so vella n u dont hv anyother tasks to do in ur life rather than sending me requests . I was dumbstruck .i mean its first time someone said me all this wdout my mistake . I said just sorry again n left the convo. but it was so disturbing for me that too in early morning .. bt one lesson i got that guys who try to be genuine or friendly are rude no. 1 while rude guys hv pure heart &lt;3</p>
<h1>GCI- Dear lord! Why you had to apologize? BTW, is it just me or other people also think that Indian guys throw their egos unnecessarily?</h1>
