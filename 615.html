<p>hey admin, hw r u?
i shubh malik
let me post my realstory too...
i m living in my colg hostel and one person spoiled my colg life.
there is a seniour who started talking to me and flirt wid me, he told me dat i look cute and sexy so he wanted to date me and hav fun wid me..
chatting went on fr few weeks bt lustly he said les hav hotel and hav sm fun. i denied and said i had to go fr my classes.. he asked me dat hw many times i hav done sex?.. i lied to him to dat i dnt feel amateure in front of him and said i hav done many times , wid boys too...
now turning point came. he stopped talking to me. he blocked me. he never answered me n worst thing he did dat he showed our conversations to his friends who bully me now by saying me gay in front of all. all of his friends make cmnt behind my back..
its very torturing
bt i still like him
but i hav promised myself i will not talk to him ever in my life and will nt see him ever...</p>

<h1>Viv- One thing you could do is that you ignore them. Do not feel ashamed and do not pay heed to what they say. The other thing can be done is be a bitch. You may have the chat history. Take screenshots and put them up online for everyone to see that how he wanted you to go to a hotel with him and have fun. Then his face will be worth watching.</h1>
<p>PS- Its not shameful to feel amateurish. And stop liking that douchebag!</p>
