<p>I have started to wonder, what kind of world are we creating for ourselves! We want ourselves to be called and treated just the same as any other human being but our actions betray and disgrace our community the more. We are becoming sex addicts...nothing more than age,preference and location people ask...wondering are we left with just body to caress with...or still have the heart to ponder upon!!!
We communicate on social networking sites just to find ourselves on someones bed. I have observed a change in myself..may be some of you might have also noticed...when i am not thinking of sex , i am most creative! We all have so much to offer to the world but we start resorting to offer just our skin ....
So many talented souls are wasted in the name of sexual ecstasy which turns out to be an addiction and ends with frustration. I love to read , i am a trained dancer , i sketch passionately , i love to elevate myself spiritually, i want to start writing , i want to explore new places , learn a new language , make people smile and so on...but there is one hurdle in the way ! Thats my extended sex addiction.. i have come out of that phase where i wanted to have sex...its the phase where i am just clinging on to think about sex when i dont even gain much pleasure!</p>
<p>Here, i was just trying to unveil what i felt for myself in the most honest way....Its harsh to call yourself a sex addict but i want to take things as they are , bang them and get out of them!</p>
<p>P.S. We cannot always be oblivious to our demons!!!</p>
