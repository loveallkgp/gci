<p>So here is my confession.
Gay 26 Bangalore.
Most of the straight guys that I have come across in my life, My college friends and my colleague likes me as I friend. They like my company. I am tired of this comments "You are cute" from my colleague. I have a bf and even my bf said many straight guys will like you. I ask him why ? He just said you are cute. But before I met my bf I tried to date so many guys.(gays) .But I didn't meet their criteria. So I realised later that I am not really cute. Or maybe too many hot gay guys so perhaps I am out of competition. Now the most funny part is,one of the guy whom I met randomly from Pr for coffee long back was hired as a manager for my project. Yesterday before I left office he ask me "Hi today is Friday what's your plan for weekends"? I said " going for friend's birthday party " Then he asked "straight or gay"? I said "straight". Then he ask have you ever tried with straight ? I said " no". Then he said " oh come on you are cute all straight guys will like you. Just get drunk and seduce them. Nobody is 100% straight ". So in party after lots of drinks and cutting cake most of them left. 5 remains. Me,Deepak Dhabi married guy,bday boy and his gf. Married guy went and slept off in one room. Bday boy and gf on the other room and Deepak went to sleep on the other room. Bday boy the sweet guy ask me to stay back . He ask me to sleep with Deepak on king size bed of his guest room. Deepak was hot , already drunk and fast asleep so I went and sleep next to him. Bday boy off the light ,on the fan ,closed the door and went off. Suddenly I remember my  manager's advice.But I couldn't do it as I was too drunk. Morning when I wake up hot Deepak was still beside me. This is the first time that I met Deepak. We didn't know each other before. So my heart was beating fast. But I build up my courage and my hand reach out to Deepak's dick inside his tight jeans. It was OMG moment. His dick was not hard but it was big. I guess it will be around 8 inch if it got erect. Huge long soft non erect dick was inside his tight jeans. I started playing with his dick. Suddenly he woke up. Look at my face and he get out from the bed without saying anything. Nor did he react. I respect him for that. So I book the cab, my cab arrived so I went out. Deepak was sleeping on the couch. I feel so bad and embarrassed so I we t out quitely. Now Saturday eve- Deepak got my no. From bday boy and he call me and invite me for drinks in a pub which is near my house. So I ask him how many of them are coming to pub.He said Bday boy and his gf you and that married guy ? I said no to him as I was scared that he might disclose the incident while drinking. He said OK. But just now he text me again can I stay in your room for tonight. Admin batao kha karun ? Subhe to nashe me the isliye kiya. AAP me hosh me hoon. What should I do ? Batao jalti batao ? I have a bf.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm..OMG..Large dicks are so overrated...how can one even suck them???</h1>
<p>Dear u did a foolish act but remember never to ask for such embarrassing PR marka suggestions from some Tom dick harry!
For the present situation just act as if nothing happened and even if the guy tries to bring out the issue privately o publicly ...try to find out about him as a person then go accordingly and yes even if you have a bf u did nothing wrong..but u did nothing right either..</p>
