<h1>Viv- Dude, as simple as it could be understood, he is ignoring you. He talks about a girl to divert the you-proposing-him topic. DING DING DING! He is straight and he is not comfortable to talk about gay stuff thats why he ignores you and divert the topic. Maybe now you could think about what to do.</h1>
