<p>Hey all. I am a doc here. I have a very close doc friend whose boyfriend (an IITian) has left him and now dating another guy. My friend is depressed for 5 months, i have not met him but i chat with him and the conversation leads to tears. Few days back he came to know that his bf is dating someone else, after that he is totally down, not even talking to me. And he still loves that guy and keep saying that if he is happy i will be happy single. I want to tell his ex that what you have done to my friend is very bad, i have known him for 4 years but he has never been in such shape. You can not make a family once you have broken someone's heart. My friend who is such a nice guy, has come to such a bad state because of you and that moron still finds it fine if you are happy with someone else. You will have to suffer for your deeds.
Admin tum bhale hi mujhe gaali do par mai apne dost ki aisi haalat karne wale ko kabhi maaf nahi kar paunga.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well I don't blame you at all for it. You are standing for your friend and that is really a good sign of a very good friend.</h1>
