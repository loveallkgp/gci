<p>I'm just a normal guy. I mean I ain't sissy type. I know Every gays ain't sissy(It doesn't mean that sissy ain't normal but I know you guys got it what I'm trying to say). I'm not even sure about my sexuality whether I'm gay or not. I'm having a very complicated life now because I'm confused. I've done some oral with some few men which I like it very much but I've never feel love for those men. One-time a guy, he's good looking men, I admired him a lot and he loves me a lot, he was very manly and he even propose me but I denied because I didn't have any feelings for him. Not only him but every men which I had met. I don't know what I'm up to. I really need help on this.
Thank you</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe you are just after sex, who knows. Maybe you are not able to accept yourself fully that's why the thought of being in relation with a guy scares you internally, and that's why you are not thinking about having relations. If you are attracted to men physically, mentally and sexually, you are gay. What are you feelings about girls? Do you like them as well? If yes, then you can be a bi as well. It's really upon you to figure that out.</h1>
