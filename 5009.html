<p>19 gay mumbai
guys wanna ask u a question ..
guys if u get a chance to become a straight male person.. then will u continue ur life as a gay or would u turn into a normal staight male ..?
im a versatile guy .. in my locality i have a crush on my bestest frnd.. his younger brother is a gay n he(d younger brother of my crush) forces me to have sex with him.. my crush knows that i love him ..but he simply says that he is a straight male person n cannot get into a relationship with any gay guy! instead he ask m to get into a relationship with his younger brother. which is not very possible for me..
i think im a gay for him .. n sleeping with any other guy is not my cup of tea!..
errr what should i do.. first a fall i dont wanted to b a gay.. because being a gay v have to endure a lot of things!
n i seriously dont like having sex with anyone neither guy nor girl.. ill only have sex with my crush n if he doesnt agree's then ill stqy single forever n will not indulge in any kind of hanky panky with anyone..!
n do answer the question ..which ive asked u all in the intial lines of d confession!</p>
<h1>GCI- Ehhh nope. I came out of the hole once and have no interest in going back in another one again.</h1>
<p>BTW, you really cannot force it upon anyone. It's good that he didn't make it a big issue like some guys do. He took it in a good way. So calm down, get over him and start with something new.</p>
