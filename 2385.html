<h1>GCI- Mutual masturbation in public? :o Bleugh! BTW, do not worry about such guys. Yes they do have guts to approach strangers, ask handsome hunks out for hookups on streets or facebook but one thing that they lack is the guts to stand up for our rights. These people think that this is just a phase, that being gay is just about having sex with boys, and then they will end up getting married to a girl but at the end of the day they will still visit the washrooms to get hooked up with boys. Yes, this does sends a wrong image as getting our rights is the primary motive. We should be focus towards send out good stories.</h1>
