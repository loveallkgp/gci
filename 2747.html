<p>It was almost two years go i came across this book 'fifty shades of grey' ...i don't read such books and now they have made a movie on it and just today released it's official trailer (yeah, do watch it on youtube) after watching it i feel what if 30 years from now, people start writing gay porno books and release movies like 'fifty shades of grey' in gay theme, what if such movies are released and made in india, i guess by then censor board will be liberal and people (both gay and straights) may line up in theatre to watch it...what are your views? Do you think such sexual gay themed movies (highly sexual like FSOG) should be released in india?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well I wouldn't mind if it happens! :D Not porno themed movies as of now but we need good stuff to deal with the changing mindset issues. Moreover, India is far away from such situation. You say 30 years? I'm gonna say it will take more than 50 years for Indian cinema to have such sexual themed movies released here.</h1>
