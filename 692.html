<p>just some hours ago I confessed that "should I commit suicide"
and wao I got so many positive responses . special thanks to vishwas aggarwal.
last night I told my parent about my sexuality. I tell you how it did it -
me - mom ! would you have accepted me if I was born handicape ?</p>
<p>mom - sure after all you was only son of me and when you was born I got the reason for my life.</p>
<p>me - mom! I'm dying everyday. help me out of it.</p>
<p>mom -- pls tell me. what happened</p>
<p>me -- mom! aa aa actually I'm gay.</p>
<p>mom-- gay ? what does that mean ?</p>
<p>me -- I'm attracted towards boys only nd I have no control over this feeling. now u tell me, should I leave your home.</p>
<p>mom-- I am happy that my boy who always use to preach other about living the life happily has finnaly found his way to be happy. don't care about society. live your life the way you want. I will help you to find a handsome man for you.</p>
<p>I cried n hugged my mom. so guys u all have taught me a lesson that there's nothing wrong with sexuality. god has made us like that . accept yourself and help the community and do the revolution with your success.
thanks and love to all. a real humanity is just here.</p>
<h1>Viv- Awwwwwwww.. that really gave tears in my eyes.. a real motivation you are for many people here on this page.</h1>
