<p>When you apply Western standards to define
what being gay is, Bollywood men often fit the
bill. Not by choice but often because of the way
they are directed, the clothes they are made to
wear and the dancing they are expected to do.
The most masculine of actors are required to
wear flashy clothes and jewels, shed a tear, and
break into song and dance around trees! Is there
more to be said?</p>
<h1>no_offence</h1>
<h1>GCI : in past this thing could be applied like in 70's , 80's , 90's ..but that was the possible fashion in those days .blings , floral prints , colorful pants and ties ...  be it hollywood or be it bollywood or be it anywhere in the world .. every hero was dressed up as a gay guy .</h1>
<p>but not now . normally now bollywood heroes wear nothing but plain suits or t shirts or jeans . ever seen somebody wearing jockstraps , short shorts . </p>
<p>some movies are exception but indian singers or actors don't fit in fashion today . they aren't experimenting and they can't pull off anything . tell me how many heroes are their that can be actually called as fashion trend setters . don't say amir khan .. he just did it once in gajni . but indian fashion industry has improved and has so much of things to offer .</p>
