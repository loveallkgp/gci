<p>guys, post it plz</p>
<p>Well, my first post from my real account.</p>
<p>From Kolkata. Male, 28.
Last month, one NGO dealing mainly with Transgenders organised a carnival, and I wished to go, finally I didn't go fr sum reasons, but I did tell mom dat wat I was going to attend, n wen she asked 'why, are you one of them? You are not, then?' I smiled and said 'No, I am not'
When the Amir khan episode was aired, I made sure my mom n dad, specially mom watches it.
So, today I was getting my clothes arranged, n baton baton main told mom dat M going on a gathering on 31st, agenda Ipc 377.
Then had to explain her abt 377, dude, it was weird n I was smiling, pta nei q! N yep, the book where from I was explain abt d law, did mention 'homosexual'
N finally she asked me 'are you homoaexual?'
n I, after a lil pause said, 'yes'.
Tried explain to her with my limited knowledge.
My legs shook, I felt funny coz this was not the situation I thought in which I would 'come out', like a girl has lots of dreams about her first sex! I do had planned,dat me n mom, sitting somewhere, like Nayna and her mom, from KHNH, N we shall talk. Mom was shocked, first she thout I was lying, some kinda prank may be, but den she undwrstood, tried explaing and giving examples, wont say my best coz I was having a lot of thoughts coming into my mind.
Her response was, it was not normal, it's I who need counselling, not she, and society wont accept me, and I am not efiminate enough to be gay.
She is not fully aware, and dats y she is saying this.
I do understand wat my mom must be going through, no, actually I don.t, coz I don't have a son.
I know my mom loves me a looooot, n she wont be rude to me, no matter what.</p>
<p>Reaction from my two close friends, who are also gay, n well educated.
1st: 'I am proud of you, get a job asap, and give ur mom time'
2nd: ' You only think about your happyness, m sorry m saying this. You didn't think abt wat your mom will feel.
One day you will remorse for what you have done today'</p>
<p>I needed a relief, so came online, fought with the friend who calls me 'drama queen' and cried.</p>
<p>Yes, I did it.
I told my Mom 'I am gay'.
Dono wat waits fr me tomorrow morning, but I dont think I have done anything wrong by not lying to the person who loves me more than herself.</p>
<h1>GCI- It's not about happiness, it's about the truth and by suppressing the truth you seek temporary happiness. That friend of yours will face the music one day and then he will look back at his foolish self in remorse. You did a good job at coming out. Like your other friend said, give your mom some time. As this is new for her, it's difficult for her to digest it.</h1>
