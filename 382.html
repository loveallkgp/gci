<p>M in love with a friend of mine.I don't know whether he love me or not but I love him so much.....the way he speaks, looks and the way he smiles is mesmerizing. .... I have fallen for him so badly....One night at a party both of us drank so much that we got drunk  I could hardly walk n he carried me back to his home....That night I did oral sex on him n he accepted it... but the moment I finished it....he went to the couch n sleep there..... This made me sad bcos he didn't sleep with me..... after the incident I couldn't face him well... is he in love with me or he did just for pleasure I don't know.....plz help?</p>
<h1>Viv- That was just drunk sex and nothing serious, and you both went guilt. Clearly he did a bit more. Looks like he is straight so i would advice you to not make any moves which can harm your friendship and your character in his eyes.</h1>
