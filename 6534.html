<p>people its gonna be a long one. So I proposed to the one after a waiting period of 1.5 years. I am really proud of myself. I dont know whether he is gay ( come on, you like some one so much, wonderful person by heart, but he is too busy in his work and never sat with you for a lengthy texting, nor I know Hindi to speak fluently with him. I am a south Indian and he is a punjabi :/ ), but all I know is he is a wonderful guy. I asked some times through the page to help me propose him / finding him gay or not. Thanks all of you for that. So here it goes, my love proposal after more than 3 years to someone with 1.5 years of waiting:</p>
<p>Dear <strong><em>*</em></strong> sir,</p>
<p>I was thinking to tell you something since quite some time. I know you for the past 1.5 years. I know you are a wonderful man, with kind heart towards wild life and your career is so damn interesting, which I have never thought about. May be since last December I was thinking to tell you this. I know literally NOTHING about you except you are good man. And, I think that is more than enough, i don't know how to say this, but I am in love with you since last year. I mean it. I wish every second of my future life could be spent with you. I am sensible, matured, I completely know what I am speaking. I don't know anything much about you, your character, whats your plan,whom are you in love with, a girl or a boy, or a single, nothing. I don't know anything except you are a man with a beautiful heart. And I will be fortunate if I get the privilege of living with you soon here after. You disturbed me too much in my thought these days and today I couldn't stop myself from telling this to you. Seriously, every single night, I dreamed of being with you. and I felt its enough, as I couldn't move past this by hiding all this from you. You might have got some idea from all my earlier texts, but I really could not judge you. so I just wanted to say it today to you. "I am in Love with You Dear <strong><em>*</em></strong>" I am very extremely sorry if I am hurting you by saying all this stupid things to you. I know I am suddenly sounding stupid, but I am just hiding this from you since last year. So I analysed it 1000 times, thought about it a million times, I even planned to make a visit to see you to think more about it, before speaking anything to you. But today I just cannot contain it within myself. so letting it out. You are much more than a bro or a friend, I wish myself to be a half of you. Am sorry again sir, to disturb you with message of this sort. I know you will feel bad, but I couldn't help it. its not some stupid teen speaking out of hormonal drama. I am well matured to understand what I am speaking and to whom I am speaking.</p>
<p>Now you can either 1) say yes or no and proceed to be still a good friend of mine 2) you can unfriend me 3 ) you can block me and insult me. But being with animals and a lover of wild life, I feel you can understand what is this all about and handle this in a matured way. Take your time to reply. Its completely okay and glad even if you say no. I just wanted to say what I am feeling for you since August 2014. Nothing more. Hope what I have told you is just only between you and me. I will just be unfortunate, if you say no. and its okay :) Take care sir. I love you so much <strong><em>*</em></strong>**** Singh. Take care.</p>
<p>Best regards,
XXX</p>
<p>I feel so relieved today ! :) Thank you !</p>
