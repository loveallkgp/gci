<p>Hello friends. My nephew told us hes gay a couple of years back. We all slapped him and asked his dad to stop his internet and american movie access. Since then he has forgotten this bad habit and never brought it up again. I must say I am deeply disappointed with todays youth. During my time in 80s there were no gays in india. You didnt find them on roads tv or anywhere. Only some hijdas were there. You know why? Mainly bcoz youth were not exposed to western culture. They were hardworking and loved their families. Nowadays kids, they see hollywood movies where they show men kissing and want to act like that and think its normal. I was shocked to see some people protesting against 377 to have such kind of sex. You are our countries future. Please dont ruin your lives and our great culture by falling into western trap. Americans must be laughing at us now how they destroyed our culture and made us like them.</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, you all should be sent to jail for beating your kid. Secondly, you talk about culture? I can give you and your dead generation a lecture on whole Indian culture. What you are calling as the Indian culture is nothing but the follow up of Mughal and British colonization beliefs. Homosexuality existed ever since the dawn of human beings. So does stupidity in conservative people like you.</h1>
<p>There were no gays in 80s, you say? Sir, they existed but only because people had no knowledge about it at all, you ignored the stuff. But now as people have more knowledge and want to live as we are, why should we even bother to think  about what you think? Fuck the culture, it's about human rights. </p>
<p>Why do you drive cars? They are a product of western culture. You should be happy with bailgaadi. Why do you go to fancy dinner parties? Visit mandirs or whatever place you worship for a get together. Why wear western clothes? Wear dhoti and kurta as they were a part of Indian culture. Why use technology as well? Your mere gadgets come from west. </p>
<p>Stupid people. Aa jate hain culture ka jhanda lekar. Kuch seekha nai zindagi mein aur dusro ko batate hain ki kaise jeena hai. I will only care for your words if and only if you are paying for my expenses. Otherwise don't even bother to spew shit.</p>
