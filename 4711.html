<p>My story is pretty plain, pretty much like the rest of the other stories I've read. Im glad I found this Page. Okay, so I never truly understand what it really meant to be a gay person eventhough I knew I was different way back when I was a kid. But I was just a kid and I was busy being a kid and I ignored that feelings for a long time till High school pretending to be straight and waiting for the day the feelings would go away, until one day I found an old 1980s magazine( from my grandfather pile up old News magazines) there was an article titled 'Growing up Gay' about a Canadian gay student who struggled to keep his relationship with his family after he came out to them. It was the first time I read something that finally relates to who I am( except the coming out part) and then it Hit me ' this is me.. this is my story '.. it was emotionally painful but I was relieved at the same time because my doubts were cleared and I realised I'm not going to be gay for a temporary period but for the rest of my life and I have to find a way to accepted it. But it wasn't easy and that was the year I was in the 9th class of my high school years and it was also the most depressed point of my life and the worst thing was not being able to tell my parents. But I somehow found a way to deal with it because I have to passed out high school which I did (Thank God) on an average result and then I moved on to my higher studies and here I am in college. I think now Im so much stronger and smarter in dealing with my feelings and with the people I met so far then who I was back in High school. I grew up without all the things that people took for granted like being in a circle of friends, being in a relationships, I missed out re-union dinners, picnics, parties etc because I was a shame of who I was. But now I'm not, because I met so many gay people on the net which is really cool and 'accepted' is a big word and for some people it took a long time to truly understand and accepted themselves depending on the person . And the feeling of being gay still depressed me every now and then because im still a closet gay and the everyday people of my life still think im straight' its a struggle I have to lived with and I chose not to struggle with sadness and complains but with hopes and appreciation of the presence( every dark clouds has its silver linning). Never looked back to the past trying to find reasons nor worried to much about the future, its a waste of time. I know my story is a random messed up but its true and I just wanted to let it out. I will always stand up and support gay people just because I'm one of them and because the world is too busy trying to fixing its own problems.</p>
<h1>GCI- And I loved your story. But one thing that you have to change yourself is about feeling depressed about yourself. You cannot do that. If you feel happy, the world is a much more happier place. Everyone of us has had a struggle full of life. Use that struggle as an experience and not as a negative thing in your life.</h1>
