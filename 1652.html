<h1>Viv- That straight guy expects your friend to make the first move? And he showed your friend his pee pee too? And your friend is in love with him and he basically wanted to have sex with in him in a room. Yeah I remember that confession. The point is that if someone loves you, he won't resort to such cheap measure of attraction like flashing of dick. Now, if your friend has any self respect he should stay the hell away from him. Period.</h1>
