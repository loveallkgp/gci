<p>Hii all.......m 20, an undergraduate, i have a boyfriend which i don't value much as he is not exactly the guy i wanted as my partner but due to his consistency...i said yes.......initially i took him like a tom, dick &amp; harry.....but he proved to be such an amazing person.....he is playing one of the best people and a best friend i have ever found....now the problem is that in spite of all this...i am not able to love him.,......its just i don't want to take a step forward but neither wann hurt him at any cost as he is a very genuine and good guy.....plus he has become a very good friend of mine....i don't wanna loose it all........i have confessd my feelings to him and he was ok with it....hr even said that he doesn't seem expect me to love him back the way he loves me.....all he wants is me beside him and some care.......which is not a big deal for me as i am like this only with rest of my friends as well.....i am in final year of my graduation and he has started his masters in the same college which means he is gonna stay back oje extra year after i leave the college......... I don't wanna hurt him neither wanna commit a relationship as i know even if i do...i won't be loyal......n i can't do that...</p>
<p>.
.suggest me some way out of it </p>
<h1>GCI- Look at it from a different perspective. If he, God forbids, dies or have to move somewhere else or chooses not to talk with you again without giving you any reason, how would you feel? You would miss him like anything and you'd miss his love. You would then say that there would be nobody else who would love you like he did. You may not feel it now but if he goes away you'd definitely feel it. I know this because there have been confessions like yours in the past and people did feel what I just told you. Anyway., if you still don't feel anything then finish it off. It is not good at all to keep him on hope where there is no future of you both from your side.</h1>
