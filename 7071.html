<p>Hi this is my 2nd confession.
I am fat. 
I posted about the hot guy in our office, whom I have crush on and one fine day he started talking to me. 
So slowly friendship grew from jhi's to few conversations, funny ones. But is very unintersted in chating online. 
Ones I pinged him and he was like "Pagal! go and work out! ". 
My reply was "mujse na hopayega! "<br>
he: "hahaha"
me: "you are not supposed to laugh. I expect you to motivate me :p"
he: "No one will motivate you. Its your body. You should be concerned"
Me: "cool"
me:"why arent you uploading any pics these days"
he: "why shud I? not intersted"
me: "Are you irritated by me or FB?"
He: "By you"
me:"sorry I didnt know that"
he :'' I am kidding bro"
after a while.. when I again pinged him..
he said"Buddy i dont talk much on fb/ dont text me." 
me: "cool"..
this was on friday.
 I was so depressed and stopped talking to him. The next monday he came to me and asked me why I wasnt pinging him these days. I was totally blank. He said sorry. 
He then started speaking about weight loss and started motivating me.  He also suggested me come to gym with him." He said you are not even that fat. You just need some workout.
come to gym I will make you slim."
again I ping him on FB he wont reply.
the problem is my team is shifting to a different office location. I will not be able to see him there. He will not reply to my messages atleast.
Basically he seems unintersted in me. He is the one who started friendship. Why should he disturb my peaceful life? </p>

<p>Honeydew u need to understand that life is not DDLJ or Dilwale so as to say!</p>
