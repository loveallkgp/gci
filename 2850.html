<p>hey all... i m straight nd i saw a confession here about proud gay and achievements..if u people want equality then why u have parades and rub your sexuality in our faces????? We dnt have our straight parades nd we dnt luk for gay allies. Why do u ppl do that?</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, lemme write some points here..</h1>
<p>1) When straight people have to live under a burden of being alone then I'll be there to take a stand for you guys.</p>
<p>2) When straight people will be bullied by their peers and driven to tge point of suicide then I will think about joining the so called straight parade event.</p>
<p>3) When straight people will be thrown out of the home just for being straight, then I will think about taking a straight pride flag and march down in my awesome dress to support your cause.</p>
<p>4) When straight people will be taken to doctors and psychiatrists because they seem to have a certain mental condition, then in your name, I will pull the beard of baba ramdev because he is fool as it is.</p>
<p>5) When you straight people will be beaten up by total strangers or even murdered then I will march my awesome ass in your events.</p>
<p>6) And lastly when you straight people will have your country's laws which would declare you as criminals even though you work for the country and pay taxes, I will join your sorry cause.</p>
<p>So don't rub your foolish views here. Your thoughts have just been flushed. Enjoys yo' day. Ciao.</p>
