<p>I dont know why i feel unsatisfied with my life these days. It is not at all a good feel and I no more get any interest in anything ... its like i am living a dumb life with no purpose and no reason. a goal less life. aim less life.  how can i get out of these feelings.
I really want to get someone in my life who is really understanding and with whom in my life i would share my feelings... but i know its not possible for me. i know i dont look great, not very good personality that i've got, and no taste for humour.  always trying to be serious and emotional.
  FEELING LIKE HELL.<br>
unable to concentrate on anything. not even on studies these days. One more thing i've missed out to tell is i feel good when i see north guys sharing their thoughts of love and affection more that i miss here in hyd. Dont know if iam at a wrong place and searching for love but i know that there are atleast good guys here who are soft-spoken.
I go to college by bus and feel excited to see good looking guys and innocent looking guys around but at the same time i feel sad that i cant approach any one with love. I think ones mates love is a wonderful feeling for one and should never miss a chance to feel that but unfortunately i dont have any bf.

<p>oh it's not that much of problem you know . nobody ( well mostly ) here has somebody by there side . find your interests in nature , music , art and literature . and if you think you don't have good looking face then start gym and good looking body ( believe me it works..... today nobody cares what you look when you have those steel abs " mamma mia ... by the way everyone is beaurtiful ... but it takes someone special to figure it out . so till that person comes ...wait . !!! and to share your life you must ' get a life ' first :) :) .</p>
