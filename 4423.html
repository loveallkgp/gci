<p>Hi admin how, r u am a frequent reader of the post on ur page and today am here to suggest me or show me a path.</p>
<p>I am basically aboy from a middle class family and have been brought up in a locality where people r not free minded ir r not aware of whats gay and all. The thing is i have been dating an american guy for the last 6 months (we meet through an online dating site) now we r deeply in love with each other and am trying to come out to my parents about it. However, i have just started attending master degree....... and the distance between us is killing me everyday, but dont wanna leave my studies at halfway..... He cries everyday over phone that he want me their with him and i get emotionally weak..... Pls suggest me what do i do am so depressee......</p>
<h1>GCI- Think about it this way, if you leave your studies, what plan do you have? In a country like India where the society is already homophobic, can you really have no financial future just to carry your relationship? On the other hand, if you continue your masters, you can work after that, collect some money and then go to US to be with your guy. I know that love is sometimes intense to be kept so far away but still you have to think on the situation which can benefit you both.</h1>
