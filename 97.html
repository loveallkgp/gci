<h1>AdminViv- He needs some good suggestions.</h1>
<p>I am 18 and i am new in delhi. </p>
<p>i am not gay but don't know why , how , i think i am turning in gay sexuality .... so problem is this.</p>
<p>i was in punjabi from last 5 years thats why i dint know i have a cousin brother and he has son whose age is 17.
his house is located next to our house like neighbour.
so his son stays with us at night and i share my bed with him. he became very good and frank to me.. </p>
<p>when i saw him at first time i dint feel anything like love or any attractions. but nowadays i have started feeling very good when he talks to me , spend time with me..  he sleeps holding me tightly.. and even i do.. we are like best friend..<br>
 from last 2 days he is not here .. he has gone to his grandmaS house for 1 week. but i dont know why i am missing him like hell , his hugs at sleeping time.. his talks. i am missing everything of his behavior. </p>
<p>i am not gay coz i have never dated any males or talked in gay topics to them. i have dated many girls more than 15.. and my nephew also has same number of dates with girls. he is handsome and  even i am handsome becoz of the complements i get from girls. i have got many messages like girls have crushes on me.. and even i have crush on many girls. </p>
<p>but dont know why i am missing my nephew.. is this a sign  of gay??</p>
<p>and even we both are not virgin ..</p>
<p>admin what should i do?</p>
