<p>Hey ppl, I'm a medico and abt to finish my MBBS in 2mths.. Seriously I must be busy preparing for my ms entrance ryt now, but wat I'm really doing can probably ruin my life. I'm in a one sided relationship with a guy from my class, used to be my best friend and roommate too. We were so happy and joyful all through these years in MBBS but now he has a girl friend, our junior. I'm suppose to be happy for them, they're so perfect but instead I'm dying with all the agony since then. I came out of that room to live separately and get over him but its not happening, I miss him so much. On the other hand this is the most important time for me to focus on academics, I planned to leave the city once I'm done with my MBBS for coaching but my bad he said he's also moving to the same city and institute. He says he wants to be with me but whenever I see him being more happy with others than me and when I picture him being with his gf I totally go into depression.. I tried all self motivations to forget him and move on but here I am, God I feel so lost and ruined. I used to be a happy and ever cool person but now ppl look at me like I'm a psych patient with all those depressive disorders. Its like some kind of system virus, I really want to get it out..</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, one thing you have to understand that gay-straight relationship thingy. One more thing, did you pay attention to any gay guy? If not, then go for it and let things happen. Maybe you will get out of the feelings for him.</h1>
