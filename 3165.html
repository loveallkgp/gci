<p>When I realized I was gay, I was scared. I still remember those nights i spent crying. But now I started coming out. As of now, my close friends know about me and they are all so supportive. When I look back and think about what happened in my childhood, I find it stupid. But it also makes me think about those who just realized they are gay. I remember couple of Indian guys coming out of closet video that helped me accept who I am. Hopefully more people will do that encouraging more guys to come out of closet. Hopefully I will be out to everyone one day, And i will make a video about the wonderful experience I had. </p>
<p>But remember not everyone accepts, I did have few friends who are not friends anymore. But who cares they didn't stand by after knowing who i really was, I don't consider them as friends anymore. There was even couple of closeted gay friends who cut me out of their life. But at end of the day, I am happy with few who would stand by my side if i ever marry a guy.</p>
<h1>GCI- Now that is called some positive confession! God bless you!</h1>
