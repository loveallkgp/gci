<p>I'm 23 n still I haven't met anyone who is gay .. I guess I'm scared a bit .. I started working few months back n decided that I should finally meet someone .. I made a profile on PR, talked to a few guys n among them I found one guy who seemed like a person I can trust we talked every day for at least three weeks , to tell you the truth I just wanted a few good gay friends to start with .. I asked him twice to meet up for a cup of thecoffee or something but he declined he didn't gave any reason but it's probably coz I'm a bit chubby .. n I am so sad now that I'm back to that place where I don't wanna meet anyone ever again :(</p>
<p>Why can't anyone see the nice person inside me :( I just feel like dying now :( :( :(</p>
<h1>GCI- Well honey, I have been away from new gay people as well. Removed grindr, PR, Jack'd, Scruff, OkCupid and Tinder three months ago and I couldn't be more happier. BTW it does sucks that people have "expectations" for friendship as well.</h1>
