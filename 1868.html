<p>A illiterate stupid asked me_
"gay logon k sex ka feeling kayse hota hai?"</p>
<p>i can't make it out &amp; replied him back_"matlab?"</p>
<p>then he cleared_
"re gay logon ka to land khada hi nahi hota isliye gand marwate hai." He also said that his neighbour gay friend said so..</p>
<p>After chating with him, i was feeling like that_'abe itna log marta hai..tu kyu mar nahi jata?</p>
<p>Oh gosh! Such type of missconceptions about lgbt they have grown!</p>
<p>I've also noticed that talking abt lgbt they cross their limits &amp; used such cheap &amp; abusive language!</p>
<p>Total time waste!</p>
<p>Its better to ignore such stupids..</p>
<h1>Gic- Can I be the first one to say eww on the choice of words? First misconception that people have is they associate homosexuality with sex only. There is another reality about homosexuality which people are completely ignorant about. And honestly, its better to not waste time on people who won't even understand. Second misconception is that apparently some people think that gay people can't have erections. One of my gay friend also said that passive(bottom) people can't have erections. When some misconceptions exist within the community why the hell should we even blame heteros for being ignorant?</h1>
