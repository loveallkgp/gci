<p>Hi #GCI
I wanna confess something
actually I hav posted earlier 3 tyms and this tym something real bad happened.
actually I m in love with a friend of mine.we talk. ..We share ...We watch movies together. ...We walk together. ..he even hold my hand while walking. .he cuddle wid me when we watch movie...he even tried to kiss me sometimes....
But few days ago we got drunk and I was a little upset about him... so he tried to comfort me.... then one thing led to another and the next thing I know that we were making out(kissing and a bit of body play).
The next morning he was all freaked out and I mean I was too..but he wasn't even talking to me...he was like maintaining a distance more lyk avoiding me....I asked him why r u behaving lyk this...he said nothing wrong...and what happened was a stupid drunken mistake. .and I ll never drink again. ...and nothing is wrong ....but I know there is....
so #GCI plz tell me what I m gonna do...I'm don't want to loose a best friend. .. :( :(</p>
<h1>GCI- He is asking for a time out, have that time out. I guess it can do you some good to forget whatever happened if you give space to each other. He obviously has some issues with himself and his identity. Let him figure that out himself.</h1>
