<p>I may be wrong but I have a question in my mind.
Being a gay if u marry a girl you may be called a cheater as u r hiding ur reality and doing so for the sake of ur family and society.</p>
<p>What can you tell a guy who is a bi and falls in love with a guy who is gay and later refuses to be with him and marry a girl.</p>
<p>I am saying so because I have a friend who is a gay and fell in love with a guy who is bi.They love each other very much but the other partner refused to be with him life long and married a girl(I mean how can u kill ur feelings for the one whom u promised to love the most in the world).The reason he gave was that his family is his priority and he can't go against their will.(I know its India, but u should have decided earlier).</p>
<p>I would like to add that bi people get their desires fulfilled from guys before marriage and from girls after marriage.Don you think in either case only bi are benefited.
Only gays who are in deeply love are suffered.</p>
<p>If someone loves you truely care for him, love him, respect his feelings and make him feel special.If only we respect each other and not take gayism as an option to fulfill our sexual desires would make us acceptable in our society and we can lead a respectable life.</p>
<p>N.B:-exceptions are always there.If the decision is mutual or if they both can continue even after marriage is a different thing.
Guys no hard feelings for you whether u are a gay or bi and moreover I am not trying to discriminate u all in terms of sexuality.I very well know that we all belong to the same LGBT family sailing on the same boat loving,caring and sharing our emotions.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well not only bi's, but some gays also do this. Many try to hide behind the fact that they are truly guy by calling themselves as bisexuals. I know of a guy who is a bisexual but he is clear upon the thought that he will be with a guy if he truly loves him. So as you said that exceptions are always there. But one thing that can be done is that if some people know that at the end they are set to get married to a girl, they should only have NSA fun. My personal thinking because playing with feelings is not at all right.</h1>
