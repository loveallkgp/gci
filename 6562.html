<p>Hello I need some idea.</p>
<p>I am a guy who usually dont hide things unless its absolutely necessary or its dangerous to tell it. In many places what I actually hide is my orientation. everything else is more or less completely transparent about me. so men being men ( i am 24, studying out of india ) at this age, keep on asking about girls girls and girls to me. So i try to change the topic and make up a random story ( some times systematic, sequential lies ) but i will come to the point of telling them at their face "I am gay, now what ?" But I fear of people bad mouthing and tell about me to other people and spoil my image. And thep erson who is my neighbour is a bangladeshi religious homophobe. He was spitting venom on gays. He is the one bugging me daily about girls. No he doesnt know i am gay. How to fix his mouth, shall I simply say i am gay ? but I did try to come out to may other indian friends but they are far from understanding about it and I left coming out. what shall I do now ? help please. </p>
<h1>GCI- How close those friends of yours are? If they are more like acquaintances, then its upon you to come out. It will hardly matter of you do or do not. If hiding your identity and continuous lying is being a mental pressure for you, then come out. If you think you can carry on like that, then don't. Your first priority should be your financial, physical and mental safety.</h1>
<p>And for that neighbor of yours, he is just a horny bastard. Just say to him, "For a straight guy, you seem to be obsessed with gays, even if you hate them. Why is that?"</p>
