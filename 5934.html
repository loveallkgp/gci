<p>I am 21 year old. Studying BSc. I am bit stressed. actually I have a younger sister, we share a quite strong bond but off lately I think she has a doubt on me, that I'm gay. She keeps on saying "mujhe sab kuch pata hai, Teri puri history" and when I ask she smiles wickedly. moreover she keeps suggesting me WhatsApp statuses referring to straight relationships or girls. I am tensed and I feel like she is doing that on purpose cus might be knows about me :(
what should I do? I want to loose her, and honestly I don't think she would accept me whole heartedly as gay. everything will be torn apart. moreover I am still studying can't afford to come out at this point. suggest me something that could make me calm down. :( #Tensed</p>
<h1>GCI- U R GAY...NOT A DEMON...U R BEING PARANOID..SNAP OUT OF IT!!!!</h1>
<p>Ok if i go with as to what may happen-
1- U might get exposed, humiliated, ostracized, outcasted or maybe even shunned. But wait did it happen?????</p>
<p>Y THE HELL ARE U WORRYING OVER THAT THING WHICH IS TOTALLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND REACTION???
Now if you go with what I say-
U must be ready to accept urself if u get exposed- but only to the ryt people, otherwise keep ur mouth shut.
U must be self accepting and must not be a spineless coward for whom life would be finished if anyone knows ur truth.
U must be super confident and calm- and that comes by being truthful to ur soul and being knowledgeable for the questioners.
IF U CANT HANDLE HOW TO REACT..THE LEARN THAT FIRST!</p>
