<p>okay the confesser of confession number #174 again and this is last one...</p>
<p>my ex wife isnt single now . i have heard from my near known fellows.. that she is married with a guy whose wife died at the time of delivery.. so he needed a wife to care his child and he got my wife on matrimonial sites.....</p>
<p>so i am happy atleast her life and my child life got saved .</p>
<p>and again one thing i haven't mentioned before that at the time of divorce .. i had to give my 40% property to her (according to law)
which was aproax 4-5 crore along with 6kathas land . so my question is did i left her by destroying her life??</p>
<h1>Viv- Its raining confessions about judgements. Haha. All of this would have been avoided, the heartbreaks, the kid watching you, the divorce etc if your parents would have understood and not blackmailed you emotionally. But for the time being when she wasn't married, her life would have been hell. It wasn't your mistake though. Your parents are the one to be blamed. But next time buddy, learn to close the doors properly.</h1>
