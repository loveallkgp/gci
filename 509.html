<h1>Viv- Put it this way, those guys are just too much materialistic and their vision is obscured by the veil of too much shine of the world. Many of them can never be at peace because there will always be some more hot guy on whom they can get their hands on. Every type of person can get their desired partner. There will definitely be someone who will love you for who you are and not for your looks. I have seen no so good looking gay guys getting into a relation and living happily. So don't get yourself down and know that you are beautiful in your own way.</h1>
