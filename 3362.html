<p>"i moved to Bangalore one month ago for job reasons.
i met a guy here who was joining the same company with me. initially i did nt lik him at all bt recently he started to notice me(a gal frm my group in my company told ds) n dn i too noticed the though being in other grp, he always wants to include me in his plans. n when ever v talk(which happens rarely) he always tries to hold my shoulders or some physical contact. which he never does wd any other guy or gal. i think he might lik me, is dr any way i can conform it??
admin plz i need a solution if possible. otherwise ur sarcastic comments will also do.... :)"</p>
<h1>gci- Hmm the next time he grabs your shoulders, you rub his side abdomen with your elbow in a sensual way. If he smiles at you then you are good to go, or if he is taken aback then just say you masturbate too much so you arm is not in your control. :)</h1>
