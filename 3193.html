<p>Hi #Viv &amp; #Abby.. Greetings for you both! I'm of a very listening nature, respect people and their views, soft spoken. Nowadays, instead of just looking for sex &amp; hook ups, I had came up with an option of making friends from platforms like PR, etc. Thank goodness, got few gud friends with whom, I feel like spending time.. Getting bit confused bit as one of those guys says that I should just have sex and forget people whom I get from these websites, groups. He justifies his saying by stating that its hard to have friends from such things. And another guy says that he feels relaxed and comfort spending time with me. But at times, he says that I'm impotent, doesn't have sexual desires, won't able to have sex, or I'm not getting hard.. Initial days I never minded his words and thought that he is just kidding, but his each conversation has these words.. I would just like to know, whether it is casual and should I go ahead with his friendship ignoring his such statements or should I have to Piss my feels on his face, that I get when he says so.. FYI, I never had sex with these stated people, even though they looked for sex during our initial days... But not now.. Good day to All!!</p>
<h1>GCI- You know sometimes its not bad to be rude to put out your point. You can justify yourself on their faces about what you think but in a good way that they can understand it and not argue back. Its never too bad to have some good friends. I have very good gay friends and I can never think about having sex with them. Never. Being friends with a gay guy or just being gay doesn't really mean that you have to sleep with anything that walks with a dick. It is indeed hard to get friends from such platforms but if you do get one, why to indulge in sex or such talks even if you don't like it? Make it clear to your friends and make sure they don't come up with it again.</h1>
