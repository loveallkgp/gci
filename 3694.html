<p>When I was studying in a different city, I met a guy online. For a few weeks, we messaged back and forth on Facebook. He seemed like a nice guy. So, I decided to meet him at a park one night. 
When we eventually met, we sat down and shared a long conversation. We talked about our likes, dislikes, hobbies, our families, friends and about our life. Time flew by. And before I realized, it was almost 10 pm. So, I decided to excuse myself and leave. 
As I was getting ready to leave, the other guy asked if he could drop me to my place. He told me that he wanted to see where I lived. As he seemed trustworthy and I lived nearby, I said okay. 
When we arrived at my house, I felt obligated to invite him in. He accepted my invitation. Soon, he was in my bedroom and I was serving him tea. 
I offered him to sit on my bed. But he chose to sit in a far corner of my room. He seemed distant and quiet all of a sudden. I thought he was just nervous. There was also something odd about him. I didn't know what it was, but I began to sense a weirdness from him.
Minutes went by... He still remained quiet. So I switched on my laptop and began to chat with my friends online. 
After a while, I looked up and saw him staring at the blank wall in front of him. He just sat there motionless on his chair, looking at the wall with a blank expression on his face. It was then that I realized what was weird about him. The guy was talking to HIMSELF! He wasn't talking loudly. But you could see his lips moving, murmuring and slowly whispering him to himself. At one point, he even smiled... at nobody!
At that moment, I was so scared I didn't know what to do or say. But somehow, I found the courage to make up an excuse about having to get up early the next morning, and I offered to drop him to the taxi stand. Luckily for me, he left and I heaved a sigh of relief.
But that night, I could not sleep. I imagined the guy standing outside my window and just looking in. It gave me the creeps!
And well, after that incident, I was more careful about inviting somebody into my home. Lesson learned. :-)</p>
