<p>Hey!!!
All the awesome people out there
I just had a thought
Ummm
Why don't we all come out of our closets
I mean every day I read stories of queer fellows getting married nd being miserable about it
Nd i totally understand their pain and dilemma
But living a LIFE of regret is not good for u or your wife or ur kids or your society
I mean I've heard of ppl going real sour after marriage ... They hit kids hit wives hate the world in general cuz it was cruel to them
Why not avoid it all ?
Being out will make us more " visible" so to speak
A kid who is discovering himself will not hate himself cuz he will know there are ppl like him nd its totally okay to be gay
The decent kids will not fall prey to sex seekers
Cuz in the dark both wolfs nd princes look the same
Society will see how normally boring we are</p>
<p>I mean see if I'm out
Nd someone around me says shit about being queer I can stand up to him
My friends nd family can stand up to them
We can for once have a chance to grow as a society
I know its very difficult to
Backwardnesss
Illiteracy
Prejudice
But we have an advantage
We don't have a "gay culture" yet(I personally don't count fucking around in the dark some culture)
Those illiterate ppl are ignorant anyway we can show them who we actually are
That we are human
Ppl who are normal
their regular doctors nd engineers and artists
Honestly I think being gay is special
Noone ever gets a cance to actually think about who they are
What they want and fight for it
We (except sex hounds of course) are so much more compassionate nd thoughtful</p>
<p>Can't we show our beloved countrymen that ?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm being too impractical nd not so sensible
But personally I don't think I can live in the shadows my whole life
I love the sun too much :) </p>
<p>Hey admin its me the Come out guy
Plz plz plz plz plz DONT POST THAT</p>
<p>I just realized how fucking stupid nd careless that confession was
With that criminal rule still on
Someone can get hurt ya know bulliyin n ol
Besides I don't want to read about a hate murder nd feel guilty that maybe I pushed someone out</p>
<p>Plz plz plz
I'm very stupid and stupid and stupid
Sorry won't bother you again </p>
<h1>Viv- I could have not posted it but the content was good so I had to. People do need to read this. Its all true that a lot can happen afterwords but better face the world by being true to yourself. At least you won't be a puppet to society then.</h1>
