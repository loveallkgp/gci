<p>Am in Long Distance Relationship  with a guy since 3.5 years, its going good, no complication, complete trust, everything is perfect. He is serious about our future. But the problem is am moving out of India for my studies and am kinda worry thinking should i let go off him so that he can be with someone whom he can meet n date everyday or should i continue about our relation? Perhaps i might not be able to meet him for another 4yrs. But again moving out of India could be a boon as we can get married in future n settle outside India. He is not even thinking  about all these, i tried to tell but he said all he wants is me n he is ready to wait forever. Even i too love him deeply But i know its not that easy to maintain LDR. Lots of issues may arise in our relation n may lead to a disaster. </p>
<p>$ABBY :gosh you love him and you want to leave him for a pathetic reason such as going abroad . come on . if ur relationship worked for 3 years ( that's a long long time ) then why taking steps back . think of the guy who is willing to marry you and who has no problems about u moving abroad . but think of it .. he might as well can come to abroad later and you two can happily marry . problems come but a good relationship survives everything</p>
