<p>Hi,
I am straight guy and want some advice regarding a friend who is gay. He is my colleague and is my junior as well. He is very likable and very talkative. I have to literally tell him to shut the fuck up. Our morning starts with him bringing coffee for me and over some breaks or whenever he gets time gossiping about the entire office. He is cute and innocent and to me he is like my younger brother. My gf leaves me to go for shopping with him 'coz his taste is better than mine(as my gf put it).
Few months back, he came out to me as gay. I was shocked to learn that. I was in denial tbh. That this can't happen. It was like he has died for me. I started avoiding me. It has nothing to do with LGBT. But something inside me was disappointed in him and was not willing to see him. So I started avoiding him until I could figure out how to deal with it. I asked my gf and she said that she already had a clue. I was like WTF? He works with me and I never had any clue and how could she be able to figure that out. Because he doesn't fit the stereotype for what most Indians have about gay guys.
Recently, he did something that I could never forgive myself for. I was out on a project in rural area in North India. The day I came back, I received a call from hospital. Mostly a call from hospital means someone from dysfunctional family has gone crazy. But that was not case. My colleague had tried to commit suicide and one of neighbor just got in time to save his life. Before my arrival cops were there. I was the first one to get that call from hospital because he has listed me as next of kin in some insurance form. Later I learned that his family had disowned him because of his sexuality. And I was his only best friend and he cannot bear the pain to lose me as well. His suicide note broke me into pieces. He is recovering well. I came to terms with all this but I was too late. I wish I could undo all this. He is very talented fine young man with his whole life ahead of him. Me and my gf are now his new family. I asked him to move in with us. He asked, "Kya baat hai sir, hamdardi dikha rahe ho?" And I told him it's not sympathy but it's love. I always wished for a younger brother. We are good now.
But I wanted to tell all the gays out there that suicide is not an answer. Be brave. It gets better. We all have to move forward with our lives. Please seek some support. And to all the heterosexuals out there, open you f***ing mind for once. They are humans just like we are and just because they are not attracted towards the opposite sex doesn't make them any less than us.
Live and let live.
Regards,
Manu</p>
<h1>GCI- My god! I really have no words for what you did for him. You are a really good human being. Be each other's best friends or family as you put it. All hope is not lost in this world. I wish I could stop my tears of happiness right now and give you both a hug.</h1>
