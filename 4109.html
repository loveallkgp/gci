<p>Hey Everyone!!! This is not a confession but just a thought occured to me.
Lately I am seeing a lot of confessions about being lonely and sad, and most of them state that the reason of their loneliness is not having a bf/gf in their life. Even my fb frnds say that. Some of them get so depressed that they started to have suicidal intentions.
I know that having a lover will be a great thing but there is something called LIFE. We must work hard to make a gud future. If u think too much about something that u don't have, then u'll not be able to enjoy the things u have. Having a Lover is nt everything. Having good and supportive frnds can also keep u going. :-)
Here almost everyone belongs to LGBT community and at one point or the other we will have to come out. And after that there will be a chance that our parents won't accept us. If this happens then we will have to take care of ourselves.
And for that we must be qualified enough to survive without depending on others. Having a lover will surely make u feel alive but unless u get one never lose hope. Till u get ur special someone concentrate in ur life and work hard to make a good career. Gud things takes time to arrive. I am sure when u will find ur soulmate u will realise that he/she was worth the wait. :-)
look at our admin(the one in Cannada). He is single but not seeking relationship. He went to Cannada so that he can fulfill his dreams. I am sure that if he find his soulmate he'll keep him in a heartbeat..... Right?? ;-)
Similarly we must all concentrate in Life and Studies and fulfill our dreams. And fight for our rights. Make frnds and enjoy ur life.
Thats all. Sorry if it didn't make sense. :-)</p>
