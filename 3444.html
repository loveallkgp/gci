<p>Admin post this else gay-lord is gonna ruin ur sex life for next 3years :D :D :D
Feelings i get Regarding some confession in GCI esp those regading child abuse.
There were days when i used to think that m gay because i was molested by my uncle when i was a child. But today i have accept the fact that i was a born gay. it would just be a mere excuse if i say such. Hoping some post in GCI where people would be claiming they r gay because they wore their sister's dress when they were a child. Or they were touched by eunuch who attended attending their birth for asirbad; hence so they are gay. Lame excuses. People need to accept what they r rather than projecting their suffocation &amp; anger, being specialist one into lame-excuses :D</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh Hell no! The Gay Lord Talks through me! These days He is being silent because He is partying and stuff. He will be back soon.</h1>
