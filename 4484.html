<p>You Know,
some secrets are really devastating when they get exposed in front of your family,friends and close ones ... For an emotional, sensitive and thoughtful guy like me it's been always of tooo much pain whenever I have to think even unintentionally about my sexual urges ... I love my religion and my society ! and I also have been within the belief that religion and society is only for the betterment of of their lover ! then why will they consider me as a sinner ??? if the almighty god knows all the deepest psychology about his creation then why the religious view is acting like this to me ??? There are sooo many questions that I need to be answered !!! may be I m getting weaker by the gradual severity of fight with my thoughts ... may be this is the only reason of turning down all my happiness into sadness !!! may be I m really confused that very soon I have to surrender myself to my painful thoughts by giving my valueless life which doesn't have any meaning in the eye of my religion and my society !!! :'( :'( :'( ...</p>
<h1>GCI- Blind trust in religion and society is the very thing that is keeping the world away from peace in this era. For a day just practice this- Denounce your religion and think that the society doesn't matter. What will you feel like? Happy? Joyful? Light hearted? Now compare it with how you feel everyday with this conflict? Sad? Melancholic? Always under stress and depression?</h1>
<p>Which one would you choose to make your life better? </p>
<p>The choice is yours :)</p>
<p>PS- One last thing. When you are dying or you are in the dire need of money or you are hungry and have nothing to eat, no religious people or no society people will come there to help you out. This is our society.</p>
