<p>Hello to all lovely people here ! smile emoticon amazing page ! smile emoticon but admin ji u r being a bit rude aajkal ! colonthree emoticon tongue emoticon (personal opinion ! Ignore this tho admin ji tongue emoticon ) so coming to the point ........its like I am mohit , a 16 year old gay guy and as u all know about the "agony" ( tongue emoticon ) of not being open ..... I won't go on wid my dukh bhari dastaan .....the thing is that day before yesterday I went a bit bhaavuk while talking to my sister on phone and I told her that I have a secret to tell which if paa comes to know he will kick me out of the house ! tongue emoticon and etc. Etc. ......so I gave lots of hints and created lot of suspense ! And she is now left being tensed and thinking that m depressed ! (Crazy me ! Always making blunders ) ...... So she gave me deadline that I got to tell her everything up to this Sunday or else she would tell about the convo. To maa and paa ...... I want to tell her but as far as I have analysed ..... She is like not so gay friendly and laughs on gay jokes and all that .......so her reaction is not really expected to be positive ..... M super scared and confused ! I want to make the coming put session kinda emotional or else its gonna be weird and funny ( squint emoticon squint emoticon ) for her ! I have told my best friend about my feelings for him 2 weeks ago and he blocked me and now whole of my old school knows m gay ! so m even more nervous ......Tips needed ! ....... In short if I say ..... "Tell me how to come out ! " _/\
One more thing ......I followed this page from august 2014 to march 2015 and then the page disappeared smwhere ! how come ? Its like  I found the page again just 3- 4 days back after lots of mashakkat ! Why so ? O_O</p>
<h1>GCI- O m f G...Holy shit u have so many shits multiplied but don't worry there is nothing to panic about the snake, its just a fucking rope.</h1>
<p>Calm down honey its gonna be all lecturing all the way from here-
1- Don't involve your sister and make up a hoax story and get rid of her.
2- There is no need to COME OUT as you are NOT independent.
3- U must ignore your school friend at all possible costs.
4- Be at peace with yourself and start this with unburdening your truth to YOURSELF only for the time being.
5- Don't get carried away in the flow of the teenage hormones. THEY are high on every front so learn to discipline them by being expressive in other ways(sports, craft, hobby or any other interesting activity).
6- Do not masturbate over the situation, as it will lead to health problems only.
7- Be your own Atreyu and now act diligently and very cautiously and stop following the norm of 'coming out' as all fairy tale shit. Real life has different scenes individually.
Good luck and stop burdening urself, the more u will pressurise urself the more unstable outcome u shall face. BE YOUR WON HERO NOW MY BOY!! ONLY U CAN MAKE OR MAR UR LIFE NOW!!!
Keep the 'atom bomb' of coming out detonated and drop it with full confidence on the day when u will create ur favourable conditions accordingly. 
The page was banned by FB and came back only after we(admins) protested via mails against it and raised the issue on GSN after which the page was restored with a new name as the option to run the page smoothly.
We both are rude because we are among the rudest of people and we are sorry for being blunt at times because people forget we are humans too.</p>
