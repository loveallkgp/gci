<p>To all those guys out there who are scrolling through this page because they have had a hard day or are very bored right now.
To all those who are fed up with life and don't want to face another scary day or another annoying day.
To all those guys who have gone through a lot of shit in past and now dislike everyone because your hard can't help but wither at the cruelty of this world
To all those guys who haven't smiled in a long time or have never smiled,
To all those guys who have never been appreciated for what they are</p>
<p>Guys,
I love you.
There is someone out there who loves you.
There is someone out there whose life has been touched by you and they would be really sad to see you sad.
There someone out there, who has laughed, even if it was at your expense but a laugh is always healthy.
There is someone who will always think of you once in a while.</p>
<p>I dunno what made me suddenly say this,
But hug someone who means something to you, if not a lot,(or something if you are a loner like me, lol)
And thank them.
And smile.
And bring a smile on their faces. (Or draw a smiley on it's face if you're like me)</p>
<p>Take a moment out for yourself, slow down because the world around you will never slow down, but only you can stop for a few seconds and take some deep breathe. And appreciate something about yourself and comment below what you like about yourself and the person who means something you to. I am going to read you comments, and I could be the one commenting too ;)</p>
<p>Peace! :* Love you, GCI!</p>
<h1>GCI- Much love to you too confessor! :*</h1>
