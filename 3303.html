<p>"Hi admin, your page is awesome and really helpful. From some of the confessions and comments I realised that many gay guys think that it is inevitable to marry a girl and have kids to fulfill their parents wishes, to fit in the society and to protect their image.</p>
<p>Parents want the best for their children, but they often make mistakes. You can satisfy your parents but you will defeat their true purpose by choosing a life full of compromise. One day your parents wont be, but you would still be sufferring and in a part of your heart you will blame them for your sufferring.
And as for society and image. I truly am sorry that our society is so regressive, but one wrong does not justify another. If you are ready to destroy the happiness of an innocent girl to protect your image, you are not a victim, you are a deliberate asshole. You dont want to come out, dont. But you can come up with any excuse or simply refuse to marry."</p>
<h1>gci- Exactly! That's what people fail to understand. Idk what crosses their minds that they say that getting married to a girl is an option but in the long run it never turns out to be good. They can get married but after a few years they will regret when the truth hits them. The truth always comes out. There is no suppressing it.</h1>
