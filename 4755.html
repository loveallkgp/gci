<p>Hello Admin,
Need your advice and help, the situation is that i have a friend and we are very good friends. We both like and care each other alot. The problem is that i dont whether he is physically into me or not because he got a G.F also, but it seems to me that he also want get intimate physically. Is there any signs from which we can know. Like while lying down in bed he shows me his belly by raising his shirts, is it a kind of sign. Plz help because am almost sure that he loves me too but is not willing to confess directly, and i really want to get more intimate with him.
(p.s. we have slept together before but nothing happen, just close physical contact)</p>
<h1>GCI- You sure that it's love, honey? It seems like he just want to rub the bellies and the thing beneath that. Let me tell you one thing. You are in a kind of a situation where things will happen if you don't talk about it. If you discuss them later after happening, things will be awkward. You will still do it but then he will feel bad and then he will curse you one day will be left crying for him. Too much dreaming from my side but yours is not the first case I have heard.</h1>
