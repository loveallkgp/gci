<p>I am always very careful with clearing cookies after net browse. But you know how our cell keyboards have predictive text. Once my younger bro was using my cell to urgently text someone. When he typed g it showed gay. He asked about it aloud and my parents were also there. All hell happened after that. They didnt belive my excuses. Mom started crying and dad slapped me. After few days dad tried to console me. He said many foreigners with this perversion have died due to aids and now they trying to trap indians by showing its normal. He said once i have sex with girl i will not get gay feelings and he will get me married soon as i complete studies next year. My mother is a bp patient and he doesnt want her any stress. Since then i have accepted that i cannot act as gay anymore.</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh My Gawd! Not the wrong Talk. Bleh. First of all, this is not a perversion that the foreigners are trying to trap Indians. They have other thing to do as well. Its not a western concept that we are applying. Homosexuality existed in our original culture. The homophobia that exists today is because of the British law. And if you keep your actions clean with other gay guys and be careful, you cannot have aids. My God! You have to learn so much before making any silly decisions! Having sex with a girl will not "cure" you. You don't have a disease. And pffff do not fall in the trap of your parents saying that they will get you married. It will be too late to accept the reality. Think about your sexuality in a mature way and not like a kid.</h1>
