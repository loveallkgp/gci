<p>Male : 22 , Gujarat</p>
<p>Hey Guys, Need Your Help..</p>
<p>I am Straight Guy , Actually I Need Your Suggestions For My Gay Frnd ... He Is Kinda Mad For His BF Who Is Much Elder Than Him i.e. My Frnd is 23 and His BF Is Around 40.</p>
<p>But The Problem Is My Frnd Is Blindly Running After Him, Though He Knows Some Facts Abt Him Which He Is Ignoring...Which Are As Bellow ,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He Is Merried , He Claims To Love Her Wife Much But Cheating Her As He Is Having Affairs With BOYS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, You Read It Right...BOYS...He Puts His Nude Pics On PR And Invites Guys To Have Rendom Hook Ups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He Promised My Frnd To Get Settled In Canada Leaving His Family(Even His Kids) , But When My Frnd Reminds Him The Same He Ignores It Or Changes The Topic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I Evaluate These Things This Way,</p>
<p>1) If He Can Leav His Parents , Wife , Kids...He Can Anytime Leav My Frnd Too...</p>
<p>2) I Dont Think He Will Leav Family , He Is Neither Loyal To His Wife Nor To My Frndz...He Is Hawas Ka Pujari.</p>
<p>Uska BF Rich He , Vo Apni Zindagi Apne Hisab Se Ji Raha He , Jab Ki Mera Frnd Dukhi Rehta He Ye Sab Dekh Kar , Mera Frnd Jagde B Karta He In Baaton Ko Lekar Lekin Uska BF Kaise B Kar K Mana Leta He Usko (Jab Ki Vo Red Handed Pakda Gaya He Bahot Baar) , Mera Frnd Uske Liye Itna Pagal He Uske Liye Ki Vo Sab Kuch Dekh Kar B Usko Chorh Nae Pa Raha...Mujse Uski Ye Halat Nahi Dekhi Jati.</p>
<p>Maine Apne Frnd Ko Bahot Samjaya Kisi B Relationship Me Trust , Honesty , Understanding , Loyalty Ye Sab Chizen Bahot Zaroori Hoti He ...Is Insaan K Sath Uska Koi Future Nahi He...</p>
<p>Vo Meri Har Baat Samjta He Lekin Maan Nae Raha Kyo Ki Uska BF Usko Chorh Nae Raha Jab Ki Muje Nae Lagta Vo Mere Dost Se Pyaar Karta He..Yun To Vo Bahot Strong He Lekin Vo Is Baat Pe Strong Decision Nahi Le Pa Raha.</p>
<p>Muje Ab Ek Hi Rasta Dikha Jo Ye He Ki Me Aap Logo Se Suggestions Lu Aur Janu Ki Aap Uski Jagah Hote To Kya Karte? Aap Ki Baato Se Shayad Vo Khud Ko Jod Payega...!</p>
<p>Shayad Aapke Comments Usko Koi Guidance De Sake...!!</p>
<p>Thankz In Advance...</p>
<h1>GCI- This is a very serious matter indeed. If you really care for your friend, like really really care for him then you have to take control of his life. Like add restrictions on him like a parent. Do not let him call his so called bf, do not let him talk to him, do not let him meet in any sense. Its YOU who have to hard on him for his own sake. Agar zarurat parhi to 2-3 thapad bhi laga diye to koi baat nahi. And if situation requires, confront his bf or even tell his wife. He plays with people, you play with him. Its only fair and square. Afterall karma has to pay.</h1>
