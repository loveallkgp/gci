<p>I ended my tenure at one of the IITs as the research intern. I had fallen in love with a lab assistant there(as I had confessed here earlier). The last day, before coming , I gave him a small gift. I went to him and told, today is the last day of my internship here. he gave that beaming smile. he offered to shake his hand. I touched his hand. I had expected to feel so much on his touch but sadly, felt nothing coz I was too tensed. I gave him the gift ,shook his hand and rushed away. Can you tell me, why do I fall in love with only straight men? I tried turning asexual but seems that ain't gonna work.</p>
<h1>GCI- You have tried knowing gay guys? I mean if you don't try it, you cannot say you like it. Give it a shot and stop feeling for straight guys.</h1>
