<p>once I had a discussion about homosexuality wid a person whuz mature and learnt, he says every person has a percent of homosexuality in them, ppl may behave as homophobes especially in a country like India but in the core no one is totally against it, coz even homosexuality is a nature's element and its all proven that nature never makes mistakes. But many of us use this gayism only for easy sex and that's the reason I think our ancestors made it a social taboo. sometimes in my dates I feel like ppl think we exist only to have sex, I know nothing is more fun than having hot sex with a gr8 guy but still we have a whole lot life other than sex. we deserve to have a normal life just like the straight guys, and we are spoiling it ourselves. we all know straight guys also can be horny but they don't usually have regular hookups as we do. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, noted. But how many guys do you know about who don't have regular hook ups? I have straight friends from college who have friends with benefits thingy with girls, friends who had sex with girls and then left them, friends who hired prostitutes for sex etc. My room mates in delhi used to go to GB road to have sex. Most of the time they were in dance bars. So, straight guys don't have regular hook ups, you say? They are not saint, you know.</h1>
<p>PS- Nature makes mistakes, please DO NOT use it against homosexuality. I know how the mind of some people works. They mold words according to their own needs.</p>
