<p>Hi admin and all my dear friends. I am Arijit. I want all of you to ask yourself and the so called indian society a few questions. (This issue is not related to LGBT community)
I can't help myself to control my anger when I saw the video which GCI posted, about the thinking of men and society.
Who gave you the right to treat women as sex object?
Why it's the women who should leave her home after marriage?
Why should the women change her surname?
Why it's only the women who should look after the home?
Why it's only the women who should wear things(sindoor,mangalsutra etc.) to declare herself married?
Why it's only the women who should wear white clothes after her husbands death?
Most importantly why the surname of the child should not be after his or her mother?
Commonly both the partner have sex but it's only the woman who keeps the child on her womb, only the woman is who feeds her child through her breasts. A MOTHER HAS ALWYAS MORE RIGHT ON HER CHILD THAN THE FATHER. (I have promised myself a thing that when I will stand on my feet I will adopt my mom's surname, I don't care it will hurt my dad or not but I will give my mother the right she deserves).
Do you all know a WOMEN ARE ENOUGH TO RUN THE HUMAN RACE. Ya, sperms can be created synthetically but ova and uterus can't be created artifically. FEMALES ARE SUPERIOR THAN MALES.
I would like to question the Indian laws and constitution:
Why do adhar card, ration card, voter card, passport etc. needs the identification of father, why not the mothers identification is enough?
Why does censor board have problem with the scenes in which females are topless whereas the board has no problems with scenes in which men are shirtless, is that just because she has breasts or boobs. They are 'matrisudha'.</p>
<p>Aren't these things diareapect to women?
I want to ask questions to those moral police and dharmgurus:
Why women have only the responsibility to preserve your traditions and cultures? You don't have any problem if men wear western clothes but why you question women who wear western outfits?
You have no problem with guys bathing in underwear but why you feel its against our ethics if any women wear a bikini?
You say that women who show skin provoke male sexual desire which leads to rape.(In 90% rape cases it has been observed that the girls wear in burkha) Don't you think those shirtless hunks can also provoke female sexual desire? Bloody double standard.
I want to ask you all why gali's are on 'maa' ,'behen'? Why not on 'baap' 'bhai' like- tere baap ki aankh.
Why you kill a female child?
Why should only the females pay dowry?
Aurat ko ganga ka roop agar kehtae ho toh yaad rakhna, ganga mae paap dhone se ya kachra girane se woh apivatra nahi hoti.</p>
<p>Jiski devi ke roop mae puja karte ho, kyu usi ko insaan k roop mae kuchalte ho?
KYA YEH HAI TUMHARI SANSKRITI?</p>
<p>(sorry for spelling and other mistakes). Please let me know your views and if my questions make you to think and you wanna change, then please spread awareness . Please</p>
