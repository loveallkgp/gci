<p>$ABBY : darling don't change your life decisions just because your parents want or siblings want you here . see as ur one sister is married and other will get married too .. and parents aren't always going to be on one's head . then what !! then you will be alone here thinking ' if i had gone to abroad ' .. remove that if.  decision is yours .. afterall when you will go abroad and just when you will be done with yours studying there your bro might get pr by that time so he can call parents there till you settle down .</p>
