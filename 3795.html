<p>Hey friends this is om from canada so last month i posted my confession about my family wanted me to get married so here is the story continued </p>
<p>i called my father and told him i was gay and he hung up on me later my mom called me and did all the melodrama and stuff. Then i called my sister and told her that i was gay funny thing is that she said she knew it all along and could tell that i was in love with ace the way i looked at him.
.
For next two weeks i recieved calls and miss calls  -_- of many relatives whom i had not spoken in years all telling me that i was a disgrace to my family and how homosexuality is unnatural and how my mother was visiting  a tantric so she could pull off black magic on me. Meanwhile my dad had three heart attacks  which were fake (my sis told me). 
And i am going to propose ace to marry me wish me luck. Plus a  cousin of mine supported me on fb. I am sorry but i cant love those people back who cant even accept me for what i am. </p>
<p>And ace please will you marry me.  </p>
<h1>GCI- I don't know why people start being moral police all of a sudden when they don't even know a person fully and they are not even morally correct most of the times. You are doing great. Carry on with it! :)</h1>
