<p>Hello,everyone I'm anik from kolkata, 21 yrs old, 3rys ago i met a guy through fb we chat for 3weeks then we met at a public place, after meeting he started staring me ..but he talked with me very politely, but i noticed he feels kind of hesitated.... I couldn't understand what was going..he left after 1 hour ..then after returning home i called him,messaged him ..after he didn't reply for a very longg time, i became like a mad, then a sms came ..&amp; it was him he wrote  " i really like U, i think it's a starting of love BUT i can't make a relationship with U cause U R girlish (don't mind I'm saying this) i couldn't understand before, actually my family doesn't support this ,so im sorry please forgive me ," 
I was shocked..really i really didn't know that being a girlish gay i don't have right to love someone, it was my 1st experience to the reality, , after that i delete my fb account &amp; detached myself from every kind of social media, but now after 3yr im back on fb again..firstly i searched his profile..he is in a relationship..really feeling happy for him .but i really love him till now, in those yrs everytime i was thinking about him, i really missed him, the one pic of his i had was my support for those tough days, I'm back on fb bcoz i wanted to see him, i downloaded all of his pictures for more another yrs, 3 yrs ago i was thinking :im gay &amp; i love a guy ..that's ol but i learned that just bcoz I'm girlish i don't hv right to love,nobody will be there for me anytime, everyone just see the outer looks but no one don't even try to see the heart , i don't know what future brings for me but for sure i will love him till my last breath love U.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Find a guy who is broad minded enough to be with a feminine guy or prefers guys like u...simple!</h1>
<p>And don't be disheartened like this, we all have unique problems.
Hug from our side.</p>
