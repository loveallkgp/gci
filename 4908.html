<p>yet another confession here!!
i m so much in love with this page</p>
<p>so here it goes...
i m 19 studying in Delhi... live at a hostel...
generally i stay awake late at night coz there are hell lot of projects n submissions to be submitted.....
it was about 4 in the morning...i had just finished my work and Du Di.... theres a message on PR... i open the app...its from a guy from gurgaon...he had asked me for my whatsapp number.....generally i dont share my number so soon coz i dont trust anyone on PR...but dont know what drove me that day n we exchanged digits right away !!
we exchanged our pics n the show began...
Boy we chatted from 4 in the morning to 12:30 at night straightaway! we shared many virtual hugs n kisses ( i was being so stupid) we shared voice messages n lots of pictures....though he had to leave for office the next day but still he texted me whole day!! that was so sweet of him...he would ask for a picture each hour...i would click it and send it to him with all d compassion in my heart... and suddenly it dawned upon me...that i loved him truly...that all those butterflies in my stomach were trying to signal my heart something!!
we continued our chat for next three days(...in the meanwhile he got transfered from ggn to a nearby industrial area...) when he suddenly said he wants to see me...i knew that he would have to travel for 2 n half hrs just to see me...but to my surprise he was determined to do so!!
we planned it out...he would stay with me for d weekend n we would go for some shopping the next day....he had asked me to come to rajiv chowk metro to pick him up but i could not make it in time coz i was busy with my friends.... but he didnt uttered a word at this
By now i was out of my control....we reachd my hostel....i still remember how worried he was that if someone would ask who he is what would he say...
anyways we reached my room...finished a pack of kurkure n chocos over gup shup!!
he was a bit tired as he went to his office n then travelled quite a distance....we were off to bed soon!
as i layed there silently mu heart thumping a thousand drum rolls....i felt the warm n wet touch of his lips on mine....n boy i was in heaven for a minute...i had warned him earlier that i am not interested in any sort of sex dates... he joked that he would rape me !!
but now i knew that this is d guy with whom i woyld love to watch the setting sun of my life...
hey mr. rapist if u r by any chance reading this i want to tell u that whatever might come in between us i am still gonna love u forever... i know we will always be best buddies...even after u get married..
<em>sigh theres a girl in his life</em></p>
<h1>GCI- Oh! Apart from the use of the word rape and Mr. Rapist and the girl in his life, everything was good in the confession.</h1>
