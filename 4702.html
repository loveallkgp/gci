<p>My mother found out I am gay bcoz of a whatsapp msg. After lot of drama and tears, she made me visit a shrink. My bhabhi found her and seems she has cured a couple of gays in past. After torturous 3 weeks of sessions and mind exercises including very sexual questions, the shrink is saying I am not gay but have turned gay as some senior had groped me in high school. Shes saying I have no feminine habits of born gays. She has promised to cure me within a year bcoz I wasnt born this way and then I can marry and lead a normal life. While I am not sure this will work, I dont want to disappoint my parents who really have high hopes from this shrink. My mom said shes fasting every week and goes to temple daily till I become normal and get married.</p>
<h1>GCI- You know what, you can complain against that psychiatrist because Indian Psychological Association has given the decision that homosexuality is totally natural and not a disease. So how can she cure if it is not a disease? And tell your mother to calm the hell down. Will she be happy if she sees you getting married to a girl, not performing and then breaking up? Is this happiness she is looking for? Rather than making frequent visits to the temples and praying, she should atleast take some time to educate herself or even listen to you and try to understand her son! You cannot make everyone happy. The hopes of the family and the society will keep on rising.</h1>
<p>First hope- Get good marks.
Second hope- Get a good job.
Third hope- Settle down after getting married.
Fourth hope- Have children.
Fifth hope- Have a male baby.
Sixth hope- Make enough money to take care.</p>
<p>You are normal. You just have to be calm and give them some time. Stand to your ground and do not let anyone take you down.</p>
