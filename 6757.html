<p>Hi GCI. I'm a regular reader of confessions here for almost a year, though this is my first confession.
I'm 23. Basically, I'm an introvert and I'm gay. A very hard combo to live with. I used to have casual hook ups earlier but stopped after I came out to my family recently. I chat with guys on fb but beyond the general stuff and exchange of phone numbers, I find it hard to keep up a conversation. Yes, I flirt but never too much. I keep myself busy with other activities at home and thus haven't been able to build a strong relationship. People tell me I'm sweet, I return the compliment but really have no more interest to chat after that. It's like I'll spend hours or days continuously chatting to get to know a person well but can't keep it going after  a week. There's really nothing to chat about. Someone suggested me to join Grindr since it will show guys near to my place with whom I can have a face to face relationship instead of these virtual ones. I tried that but found a lot of creepy people and gave up. I'm actually quite content to live in my cocoon but sometimes when I see others having fun, I feel bad. I thought I was an introvert because of my closeted sexuality but even after coming out, it's continuing. I feel like I have to work with extra dedication to keep a friendship going and it's tough for me.  I love writing short stories, poems, like to listen to songs and write down lyrics but I don't talk about these much to others. Though my family has just about accepted my sexuality, they don't want me to socialize with gays in person. I can lie to them and go out but somehow I don't feel comfortable so end up staying at home most of the time.
Can anyone relate to what I'm saying or am I just plain crazy? Can you give me suggestions to overcome this? Gay+Introvert I really hope no one is born like this anymore.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you said that you like living in your cocoon, that's where the problem lies. You have to get yourself out and put yourself in some situations and be more talkative with people. One more thing that causes it, is the fear of vulnerability. When someone is scared of being vulnerable, they don't talk much, and just keep to themselves. Its not about blabbing something all the way to a new person but being intelligent about social interactions. To some it's natural, while to some it's acquired.</h1>
