<p>Holds me in the rain</p>
<p>It was the first day in my college hostel that I met him. He was from my city only, but we didn't knew each other. At first we didn't talk much. But eventually due to some circumstances we were made roommates by our warden. That was the turning point in our relationship. I still remember that night when it was raining outside. He touched me on my waist. I was dumbstruck. I thought he was straight. But he explained when he looks at me something happens.... He couldn't explain.... Just stammered and said sorry if I didn't liked. Sorry?? I was like....such a handsome guy....wow! Falling for me?? I knew many of my hostel mates had crush for me...but I never expected him! That night he proposed saying I am the most beautiful thing he sat in his entire life...and gave me a chocolate bar. I accepted then and their. We shared the chocolate. Coating each other in chocolate and being naughty. And now after four whole years have passed.... He hasn't changed a little bit. Same lazy guy with a laid back attitude but never forgetting to kiss mean in the morning and at night in the bed. He never used me....and frankly speaking he never ever went into physical with anyone else... Only me....even with my consent....he's the best thing that happened to me.....he's the best life partner one can ever expect.</p>
<h1>GCI- Ah! Goody! So you guys are officially boyfriends?</h1>
<p>PS- You wrote many of your hostel mates had crush on you...I still cannot digest this statement. Was your hostel full of gay guys or just horny teens?</p>
