<p>" #MyLove@16</p>
<p>Hey I'm Rohit from Delhi n my story begun when I was at a tender age of sweet16. </p>
<p>Mujhe apne school ke pass wale college me padne wale ek boy pe big Walla crush ho gaya tha. Wo aur mai ek local store pe milte the. Wo mujhe chotu bolte the n mai unhe bhaiya :-P 
Wo aur mai hum dono me bohot achi friendship ho gae thi. Wo meko apne ghar le jakar pada te bi the on weekends. Mere parents ko koi problem ni thi. </p>
<p>Ek din jab hum pad re the tab mene unse pucha ki bhaiya aap ke college ke friends ni hai kya n aap chup chup kyo rehete ho. Unhone kuch ni bola. N then mene pucha ki unke ghar me koi bi kyo ni dekhta, neither mom nor dad. Unhone thappad marke mujhe n rone lage. Rona toh mujhe bi aa raha tha but mene unke aasu pouche. He told me to go away, but I didn't. </p>
<p>Unhone force Kia toh mai chala gaya. Road pe mai chal he raha tha ki mujhe yaad aaya ki I've forgotten my phone. I went back n saw that he was crying Loudly. Mujhe kuch samaj ni aya and I didn't knock the door n went back to home. </p>
<p>Next day we met at local canteen. Mene sorry bola n he didn't said anything, he told me to go away. I refused. Unhone fir see thapad Mara, mene reply back dia n zoor se hug karlia. Mene unko bol diya Ki I love him. He took me to his home. </p>
<p>In his home I sat on his bed with him. He said that he has bought me here to tell me he has feelings for me 2 but he can't love me back n he started crying again. I asked the reason. He said go away. I said agar door he bhejna tha toh pass kyo aane diya. 
He cried very loudly. He said,""Rohit I'm sorry, I can't love you back because I love you a lot""  </p>
<p>Now this was weird. because we both loved each other a lot, I gently kissed him on lips and asked the matter. In a shivering voice he said, ""I'm having #AIDS."" For a second I thought maybe he's kidding, but he wasn't. My mind stopped working, I pushed him away and ran to my home crying. Because of my illiteracy about AIDS, I thought maybe now I'm too having AIDS. I went back home in my room, cried for hours thinking that I'll be dead tonight or maybe tomorrow or someday soon. I cried alot. But thanks to Google baba, I googled late night at 3a.m. and found and read everything about AIDS. 
Now I starTed crying again. What an idiot I'm. I wanna shit on myself. Then I wondered how could my love be so weak that just because he's having AIDS will I leave him? He has done so much for me, taught me, been with me always, so how could I be so mean. I cried for another hour. It was 4:30 am and I googled about how to be with AIDS people and everything. I didn't slept that night. </p>
<p>Next day with a lethargic weird face I went to canteen and waited for him for 7 hours and bunked school. Then I rushed to his house, knocked the door. He opened, his eyes were swollen and tired. I hugged him tightly that very moment, shut the door with my back. I asked,""are you having any cut inside Your mouth?"" he said no and I smooched him.
[10:13pm, 24/08/2014] RJ: I told him I'm sorry for what all I did and I love him a lot and I can't leave him because of the reason he too loves me madly and its his love that will never let me go away. 
Then we sat on chair, he with an apologetic face and low tone said that, "" being a gay I was very found of having sex, I once fucked a stranger and got AIDS, when I told my parents everything, they disowned me and since then I live alone.""</p>
<p>I was very touched by his story and kissed him, I told him that I'll be there with him forever. He made me promise him that, the day he dies although our love will be alive forever but he would like me to move on and find another guy. I didn't want to make this promise but I did because he don't ever wanna see me hurt. 
Since that day I take proper care of him, with God blessings he's all fine so far. 
Frankly speaking then in these 7 years our love has been unconditional, true and less sexual(but he does fucks me using condoms at times when he's fine) we masturbate and watch porn and spend too much time together.
[10:15pm, 24/08/2014] RJ: Now I'm planning to open up and tell everyone about our love hope this world understands that it's all about loving unconditionally someone who loves you too and not just sex."</p>
