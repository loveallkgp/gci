<p>hello ,,, I always think much ...I m 20 year old guy .... I have boyfriend ....I don't know why but I always feel jealous,insecure about my bf ....I am not so ugly ....i m somehow good looking ...but I feel that my boyfriend is much more good looking and capable than me ....he always says that he is v.good looking ...every girls like him ...and I don't knw y but something happen inside my heart ...I feel pain ..why is it so ??? it is making my relation weaker and weaker ..sometime i think that i should cut off my relation with him ..but i couldn't do so ..I have never confess this to him ...please suggest me ..why I feel so ???? I m in great tension ...:( :( :(</p>
<h1>GCI- BUCK UP!!! U NEED SELF APPRAISAL LESSONS!!</h1>
<p>1- The worst feeling is when u have insecurities about urself- CURB THEM!
2- The biggest disrespect u have for urself is when u compare urself to others- STOP IT!
3- The worst lies are the ones that are told to oneself regarding our capabilities- DON'T HEED THEM!
4- The biggest loss is when u lose ur self importance in ur own eyes- NEVER LOSE URSELF.
5- The first and foremost quality of love is UPLIFTMENT of the soul- have u felt the same???
6- Whatever u hear, see and feel in loving someone should make u grow WITH THE PERSON....R u falling apart???
7- In love there is no U or I...there is WE...have you found ur WE??</p>
<p>See sweety its understandable that u feel inferior ..but that ultimately kills the relation....trust me..my ex was of the kind...and we parted! Do wtever it takes to make u feel good, uplifted, confident and strong...but never whine or compare...IF U MEASURE UR SELF WORTH IN COMPARISON TO OTHER'S SCALE AND PARAMETERS.....u will ALWAYS FALL SHORT...</p>
