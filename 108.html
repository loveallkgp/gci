<p>To my best frnd,,</p>
<p>I have a confession to make. I think I am in friend-love with you. I don't want to date you or even make out with you. Because that would be weird. I just so desperately want for you to think that I am this super-awesome person,because I think you are a super-awesome person. And I want to spend a lot of time hanging out with you.
I want to Facebook-chat with you after midnight. I want you to text me to hangout. In a Platonic way,of course. I want us to @Reply to each other's tweets. And reblog each other's Tumblr reblogs. Because what you find beautiful,funnyand heartbreaking in this world is what I find beautiful,funnyand heartbreaking in this world. And when we do hang out,I don't want to swap saliva. I just want to swap favourite books. I want our hello/good-bye hugs to be longer than a casual friend hug but never so long that it becomes a lover's embrace. And if we were to be sitting on the same couch watching a movie,I might lean my left arm just a little against your right arm but never put my head on your shoulder or try to hold your hand. Because that would be weird.
So please,before I completely lose my mind,can you surprise me with pokes on Facebook? Can you e-mail me weird blog links that remind you of me? Can you text me when something crazy happens on the T.V. show we are both watching? And let me walk you to your favourite food truck? In return,I will laugh at all your jokes (even the unfunny ones) and find the best hole-in-the-wall cafes for us to have never-ending conversations in. I will make bad Photoshop drawings commemorating our hang-outs. And every single one of our internet meme cat jokes will be referenced to in the birthday cards I will draw for you every year. Believe it or not,I wouldn't be sad if you are already in a romantic relationship. As a matter of fact,I would be really happy for you. Because that's what friends are for. But if your super-awesome close friend quota has already reached its capacity,then that would really break my heart into a million pieces. Maybe you don't feel the same friend-love that I feel for you. After all,we only have so much time in this world to only have so many friends.</p>
