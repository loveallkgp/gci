<p>Recently, as I was driving around town with my cousin (in Nagaland, India), we saw a number of good looking guys.</p>
<p>My cousin is a very good looking young man. He is straight. But he knows I am gay and he has always been very supportive.</p>
<p>Anyway, coming back to my story, that day, every time I saw a good looking guy, I would tell my cousin. In return, he would also point and show me every good looking guy he saw. At that moment, I was lost in my admiration for all the good looking lads I saw. But later on, as I reflected on the events of the day, I was grateful for the kind of family I have.</p>
<p>I came out to my eldest sister (a theologian) when I was 18 years old.
Do you know what she said when I told her I was gay? She smiled and simply said, "Some people are gay, Some people are not. It's okay."
My other siblings, cousins and close friends reacted the same too when I told them I was gay.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I take things for granted because I am so used to the level of acceptance and understanding shown by my family and friends towards me. But every now and then, when I read some of your messages or stories (I am the Administrator of three pages for gay people), I realize that some of you are going through tougher situations than I am.</p>
<p>Now I don't know how I can help you or make you feel better... But I just want to let you know that not every heterosexual Indian is a raging homophobe. There are lots of straight Indians who are Pro-Gay people and are understanding and supportive of our rights too.</p>
<p>So no matter how hard or bleak your life may seem sometimes as a gay Indian in India, please don't lose hope. Continue to give your best in all that you do. You will eventually find people who love you and accept you as you are.</p>
<p>As a shy, quiet, chubby boy in school, I was often called names and bullied by others. But I survived.
I'm not saying I have a perfect life now. I don't. But most days, I am happy. And that is good enough for me.</p>
<p>So I just want you to know that no matter how tough or difficult your life may seem right now at this moment, take comfort in the knowledge that things change... and It gets better.</p>
<p>I wish you all love and happiness... Take good care of yourself...
Have pleasant hours ahead... &lt;3 (y)</p>
<h1>GCIL- I always wanted some admin of a gay page to post the stuff he said in this beautiful message. Thank u for writing as such.</h1>
