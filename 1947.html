<p>Confessor no. "1936" here.</p>
<p>I have read the comments, and it had dejected me badly. I know that straights find out hard to understand gays. But, "gays misunderstanding gays", it's unpredictable.</p>
<p>I had posted my confession for the belief that I can get some advices and tips, but you people had broke my trust by calling my confession a "fake" one.</p>
<p>What's so fake in my confession? The oppression that I am facing? The parents that are homophobic? The parents for whom family and society honor is more important? The brother who doesn't respect his brother just because he's gay? Can't I scream for help?</p>
<p>At least I had the guts to roar against what I am going through. Obviously you people will call it "fake", because you people don't have guts to do that. You will remain silent even after facing a lot of "family bullying". My sexuality is out to them, you people don't have courage to do this. And in return you are labelling my confession as "fake"?</p>
<p>Never before have I, as a gay, experienced this much betrayal, and that too, from the gay community itself.</p>
<p>What you expect me to do? Like you people, should I go back to closet? Should I live as a "fake" man? Should I live a heterosexual life though heterosexuality is no where in my nature? Should I marry a girl under the pressure of my family? Should I keep her in darkness and unknown about my true self?</p>
<p>Seriously, never before I had expected this type of response, and that too from the gays themselves.</p>
<p>If you people don't have guts to stand up for yourselves (even if you are standing alone), then kindly don't point fingers on those who can do, and call them "fake".</p>
<p>I am already depressed with my situation, and suicidal too, and currently fighting against suicidal thoughts. Please don't make me to take such a step so that I could end my life, by giving such depressing responses.</p>
<p>And lastly, for those who used words against me for standing against "family bullying", I don't respect people for their name, fame, relationship, etc. I respect people for their behavior and their personality.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well said buddy. People who called it as fake confession are the ones who are scared beyond means. There's one thing that my professor told me in college that "if a person tries to get forward by 4 steps, there will be persons behind him who will drag him 2 steps backward. This is the basic indian people's mentality." Now, those guys who called your situation a fake one, or sympathy seeking stuff, etc are the ones trying to pull your back. But at the end, why do you take the advices of those noobs? There were those who understood your confession and said some good words(Including me). Do not get suicidal and take a wrong decision. Do everything in your benefit now and be selfish.</h1>
