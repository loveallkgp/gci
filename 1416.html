<p>Hi...
22 new delhi, i hv a cnfession to make.... im laughng nw, even remebering tht moment.
i like this guy for about 1 yr nw. crush b hai.... but i thot kabi baat b nahi hogi.
i use to watch his basketball match alone for abt 2mnths nw, hiding myself behind the sides. Pta ni acchi aur ajib feeling ati thi uske liye, But i always use to walk alone...after his match n he wid his frnds. 2 days ago ... watta nyt !!.....
He was playing volleyball alone this tym , i thot aise to he will knw k... i was watchng him, bcoz  this tym noone was there to distract him. I just made my move back, slowly and he yelled from back said...''oye bore ho gya kya''.... i was stoned nervous . heheh i said 'kuch ni... bs ja ra hu'
he said 'aj accha ni lga kya ' ... i was shockd how he knew it , i ws here fr long tym.
I walked n said kal milta hu... he just laughed. Nxt day to his frnds i asked k y u guys didnt go fr practice, they say , he told thm not to cm 2day, n that he was goin to meet sum1.
I blushed, but i went away n thot it was my doubt , now in evening i didnt go thr.
It was awkward i always go there but wt i saw was tragic...he ws wid a gal thr.....
I hd tears n i ws going, i went to my way thr was a taxi so i took n went suddnly he came by n sat wid me widout sayin nythng . i ws shockd n didnt say a wrd ....he said she was his frnd. My stop came .... just then he said ''AAYA KRO YAR , PEHLE TO BHT AATE THE DEKHNE...AB BURA HO GYA HU ME KYA...?'' 
n he too came out of stop, me pay krna bhul gya he paid fr me, then he said 8 ko subah milo, kuch baat krni h .... shocking heheh thn he went inside taxi n gone........me to khada hi reh gya. Wat was tht !!
this ws an epic moment ..... kal kya hona h i dnt knw... bt ye bnda like krta h meko... i just loved it, abi itna hi kafi hai.... !!
