<p>I feel really very lonely . Yaar ... mere or mere parents k bich me ye generation gap bohot hai ... my parents are not that educated ... and I m the only son .... my parents lack hell of trust and faith on me ..... since m the only child to my parents .... and the only son to carry their legacy ahead I have to bear it all ... I have no friends .... no one to hug ... no one to underatand me ..... at times it gets so suffocating for me to live ... .. I don't know what m I suppose to do ... meri loneliness muje khai jarahi haai ... ghar ka mahol is not good .. mere parents se meri misunderstanding badh thi ja rahi hai .... life has become hell ... I m not a looser to give up ... of course I do have balls of steel to fight against this situation . But kiya karu .. kabi kabi .. bohot lonely feel kartha hu .</p>

<p>First of all a big hug to u dear....from everyone of us here....
Now listen what are u facing is not a unique problem...remember we are all fucked up....u just have to figure it of what kind of fucked up are u into. Honey u just need to focus on what are destructive thoughts and what are constructive thoughts u r having ryt now. If any of ur thought is bringing u down..DISCARD It...never encourage self sabotaging thoughts. And yes there is nothing to feel lonely about, u just need to be friends with urself first bcoz those who are friends of themselves.....the first &amp; last person they need is THEMSLEVES....just dont forget being lonely doesn't count  but being surrounded by people who make u feel empty affect. And yes if u want friends then don't roam with a manual guide....understand people and accept them as a part of ur life mutually! Rest people shall clairfy it further!</p>
<p>Goodluck honey! and godbless..</p>
