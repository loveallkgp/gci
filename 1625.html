<p>Hey i just want to ask that my bf wants to have sex with me but im not ready to have sex. Although he loves me but sometimes can be pushy. He kisses me and cuddle also but i just don't want to have sex with him. Im scared and he always say that if we don't have sex we wont have any intimate connection! What should i do?</p>

<h1>Viv- See, sex in a relation is a means to strengthen your relation and your feelings. The means of your relation shouldn't depend only on sex. Its should be loyalty and trust. He is kinda right about but at the same time he should respect your views also. If you are not ready, he should accept it. Also, relationship works on a 50-50 scale that means at a certain time you have to take care of his feelings as well to maintain the balance. Tell you what, why don't you get comfortable slowly and slowly? Like try reaching a new level after every 3rd day? it can work and you will also feel good.</h1>
