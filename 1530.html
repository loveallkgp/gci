<p>hello admins
sometimes i think about both of you, i think that how do you feel when you give suggestions to some stranger and do you ever get curious that what is the identity of confessor and sometimes i think, who are both of you? are you students or adults? are you studying and if not , what's your occupation? do you both love someone? what kind of lives both of you are leading?</p>
<p>it's not necessary to answer any of my questions, i am just sharing my thoughts and questions which my mind raises when i read confessor's confessions and your suggestions.</p>
<p>$ABBY : yes ofcourse sometimes when a confessor confess something which resembles my thought process ,... i feel like i should know this guy . but again who would be behind those curtains haunts me... lol. as about all other things ... i think it shall stay secret other wise people will lose interest and maybe behave arrogantly towards us. ( like when we told our age once and members were like aah you so young to give advice :P and all that shit i heard ) 
 i don't know about viv but  ... once gay relationships are legalised in india i will show myself for sure . :)</p>
