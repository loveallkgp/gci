<p>As a young child my father abused me and treated me like a sex slave shortly after my mother died. He abused me till my teen years untill i decided to move out of the house and stay with my maternal grand parents house in village. Now im 24 and a corporate officer. 
Recently one of long time friend proposed me. I don't know but im scared to open my heart and also I've said anything about my past. Thinking about my past makes me scare and vulnerable. Should i tell him the truth? What uf he leaves me?
Also I've not seen my father for last 8 years. Should i start talking to him, meet him? I really miss those days with my mother. I miss her very much :(</p>
<p>$ABBY : that isn't a father ... never talk to him.. yar a father or mother shall not do this to their own kids .. or to anybody's kids (without their permission ) . what was he thinking ..??? though this isn't shock to me as i have read so many fathers using their own daughters as for sex. and raping them from small age. !! </p>
<p>and you said ur friend proposed you ( and you haven't mentioned if you are gay or not ) .. see that was past and i think you shall not tell your partner about this coz it has nothing to do with him . and if you wanna tell him and if he leaves you for this then he doesn't deserve you . you were innocent and that wasn't your fault .<br>
and i would suggest you to forget all this and move on .. whatever happened was definitely very sad but just look at yourself now you have grown up good and doing a job .. everything turned good. just make life beutiful and leave past where it belongs .</p>
