<p>I need to talk to someone. I'd made choices and I don't know what results I might get, but I don't really care about results.
 I'm the kind of guy who is really really really concerned about himself. I made friends at school and I left them. I made friends after school and I left them. I made friends here and I left them. I came back made some new friends and left again. I have my own complexes, issues and flaws. But that's how I'm, that's how I think, things would change.
 I would make friends, they would get to know me and then I would leave. I always leave because I want to be unknown to them and I want them to be unknown to me. But that's not how things work out in life. To be honest, I do think, I'm doing it all wrong. But I just can't change my mind, I have to experience things to really change it. I still need to know what friendship means to 'me'.
  So, like most of the people here, I'm alone. I like it, I like myself. But you need to talk to people when that time comes. I guess, when you are weak.</p>
<p>I need to talk to someone, but how can we talk anonymously? Like the chat opens up with the name anonymous and you can't see their profile or anything, it's just blank. But you get a response from the unknown.</p>
<p>But anyway, anyone here to have convo. We would talk about anything and everything until we say goodbye. Spend time and then leave when done.</p>
<p>PS: you can assume things about me but then they would just be mere 'assumptions'.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmm....so there are weirdos like you also in this world...but i guess its fine as long no one is getting emotionally harmed in the process...I think u must find out more about urself and go deep into all the psychological aspects because ur case is really interesting!</h1>
