<p>Hola everyone .. I wrote #3994 &amp; #4043 .. In 4043 i read a lot of comments that said "FAKE" well trust me its all true .. I do like to tell my stories in a lot of detail but its all 100% true ... Now the story that i have never told before</p>
<p>When I was 14 (maybe) I was forced to change my school as my dad got transferred and this new school was a Boys school ;) . 1st day of the school and I met a cool guy he was my classmate my busmate. He was cute n all but i didn't feel any attraction towards him at all. Few months passed and then one day just the day before the exam he asked if he could borrow my notebook as he had lost his. He promised to return it by 5 PM and so despite the fact that i had the exam the very next day i gave him my notes. At around 4 PM that day it started raining cats and dogs, I went to my balcony and kept looking at the road ahead hoping he would show up. I was getting anxious coz it wa 5:30 and still no sign of him and then suddenly he appeared on his bike drenched in rain. I thought, boy, all my notes might have been washed up by that bad rain. I went up to the door welcomed him in my house, he lifted his shirt took out my notebook half buried in his pants and gave it to me and then left. That night i couldn't study one bit coz i was wanking thinking of him.</p>
<p>In the next few months I became his close friend. At that time it felt like I was madly in love with him. I was willing to do anything for him. We completed 12th and I got into a good college (not IIT but good) he didn't. He told me he is dropping a year and so I dropped too telling my parents its IIT or nothing and accompanied him to Kota. We became roommates, I was going to spend the next 9 months with him and i was happy as hell. I knew back then that he was straight but i thought that "if say i live till 90 it will be like spending a month of each decade of my life with him". During that time with him not once did I kiss him or fuck him (i could have taken advantage coz of the roommate situation especially when he was drunk) but the thing is i wanted us to be in love plus i was way too civilized to commit such an awful act. I never even told him that I was gay or I was in love with him but i did try to do things so that he figured that out himself. He probably understood that i was gay but never understood that i was in love with him. Towards the end of my stay in Kota he started to treat me like a dog (shouting at me abusing me) he only went nice on me when he wanted money. I became very sad with all these stuff and left Kota and him in the 8th month itself.</p>
<p>It has been 4 years since we last had a friendly conversation but I still sometime miss him.</p>
