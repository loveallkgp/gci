<p>Hey #Viv....
I have something to ask you...
Actually their is a guy who Love the guy whom I use to love before and he too used to love me...
But the guy whom I love now says that he had sex with that guy first time that is why he love him...</p>
<p>However now a days we talk 24*7 over phone and even I met him once...
Actually before I was not exactly in love with him his decency made me fall for him and now when we talk sometimes it feels as if he is ready to be with me and when I ask him would you be with me he says that He can't be in relation as its gonna hurt later on...
I am ready to do anything, Even I said I ll not even touch him if he don't want me to... but still he always says that He can't...
I asked him if he love that guy with whom I was in love... he always say I don't know may be...
then I said why are you spoiling your life for whom who don't love you...
I even tried to ignore him but I am unable to... :/
I really feel incomplete when we don't talk....
What should I do???</p>
<h1>Viv- Damn! What a love knot! its not even a chain  or triangle. He is clearly giving you the signal that if you two get into a relation, you will have a breakup for sure. Baad wali sadness abhi utha le.. abhi to fir thodi kamm hogi. Or, give him some time to figure himself out. Be there by his side and get him out of his previous love. Don't make him jump on the decisions that you want.</h1>
