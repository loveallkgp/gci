<p>I'm doing online dating with someone... We share nudes and all and when he's horny, he callse me up and we do sex talk. But as soon as he cums, he says goodbye and hangs up the call... Don't know what to do with him. Even i feel detached after ejaculating</p>
<h1>GCIL- Now let me clear the air.</h1>
<p>Male anatomy and physiology is not like the females. And unlike females we have an orgasm of not more than 6 seconds I guess compared to 13 of them.
Also, male hormones have the tendency to reach a peak during sex and then decline sharply after the ejaculation is over. 
Henceforth, the condition of feeling 'detached' as u say and feel after the sperms leave the body.
Its very normal if u sleep after sex and feel drowsy. Keeping awake after sex for a long period everytime is not healthy for men.
So yes! Men's body is per se selfish even if u r not one.</p>
<p>P.S- Keep a balance between health and psychological graph of urs. And no need to feel guilty about anything but don't turn into an asshole.
P.P.S- That guy is an absolute personification of the body and hormones before and after sex. He doesn't think much. No need to think of him much from ur side too.</p>
