<p>A follow-up for confession #3190</p>
<p>Dear admin,</p>
<p>For God's sake, please post this. My humble request.</p>
<p>In response to Aayan Mehra's comments:</p>
<p>I could only but pity you, sir. You hardly know me and the whole drama that's going on between me and my friend, and yet you use your words to make such bold statements that are evidence for what you're made of. I am least offended. I didn't even want to write back on this. But yes, I felt I should at least let you know that I read your comments, and yes they made me feel sorry for you. You're so naive!</p>
<p>Since I'm writing back, I want to talk to you about all those five points that you commented about.</p>
<p>Q: Firstly you did the sin of lying down with amrried fellow.. Y the heck aren't all single guys dead.</p>
<p>A: Please tell me is it not a sin sleeping with single man/men/woman/women? FYI, I've been sleeping with my friend when he was single too. ;) I loved him when he was single, and almost gave him away. But when he is back to me, I maybe absolutely wrong in thinking this, but it feels like maybe God is giving me something that I so strongly loved and cherished, and prayed for.</p>
<p>Q: Secondly because of you he might face problems in his married life with the woman who trusuts him like hell.</p>
<p>A: Baby, the reason he chased me was because his married life was at the verge of divorce. We both spoke over lots of complicated issues, and I am glad that he is now back with his wife and happy. And yes, I'm not so immature to ruin his married life just for pleasure of sex. Most off, it is mutual between us both. I never ever force him or manipulate him for sex.</p>
<p>Q: Thirdly you simply ignored the fact you are sleeping with a father a two lil kids supposedly if someone comes and boasts of doing the same with your father how you would feel for your mother.</p>
<p>A: I am fully aware that I am sleeping with a father of two kids. And darling, if someone is sleeping with my dad, why in the world he wud come and boast before me? FYI, I am not ever gonna go and boast before my friend's kids. I love them as much as I love my own kids.</p>
<p>Q: Forthly you a simply a mistake that your parents did because you lack the basic morals and ethics.</p>
<p>A: I can only laugh loud at ur foolishness to assume all that from just a confession I posted. Sir, in all due respect, there is more to me and my personality than just that piece of confession. I don't want to say I am a holy saint, but yes I am fearfully and wonderfully made by God. Please refer Psalm 139:14. You just made me cry, cheapo! I am throwing all these tears before God's throne. Reg morals and ethics, you don't have a hint of the traumatic experience I've been through to be what I am today.</p>
<p>Q: Fifthly dude if so ever i prayed for you i will definately pray that you might die of AIDS..</p>
<p>A: Please yourself. Although I don't need anyone like you pray for me. But I am glad that God in Heaven is not a psycho, naive fool like you. He isn't so dumb to give me AIDS just by hearing your prayer. If I had to get AIDS and die for what I'm doing, may it be so. But ur attitude of praying that I might "die of AIDS" is hellish, straight from the womb of Satan. Please refer Luke 9:54,55. May the good Lord rebuke you as well. Nonetheless, I would pray good for you.</p>
<p>Aayan Mehra, you seem so immature. Please use ur words wisely. I am afraid you'd have to swallow ur own words as ur own life unfolds. I really pity you! Peace be with you. :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Why don't you two just meet in reality and do wrestling only in undies with oil on your bodies and let all the members watch? I'm pretty sure that after this you won't have any issues.</h1>
