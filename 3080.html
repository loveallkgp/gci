<p>i don't know but i can't understand why no one wants to befriend with me, like you know what happened, i joined my college 2 days late and you know what i found that everyone in my class already made friends and plus total numbers of students are 61 (odd number) so everyone has their one special friend and in the end i am the only one person left, i tried to interact with them but they don't take a step forward and in my PG everyone have their special friends too and they are sp busy on laptops and mobiles that no one is intrested in making more friends and this hurts me, i am always alone so you know i just downloaded some apps and now i am watching dramas of china, japan, korea, thailand etc. and whenever i watch them , i feel so close to characters, like i feel that i'm related to them and i no longer feel lonely, i didn't that TV could be such a miraculous thing, now i understand why lonely people like watching tv, i hope my depemdence on TV is normal and me feeling related to fictional characters but whatever, i find myself the most happiest person on earth and i am thankful to whoever created TV , i love you inventor!!!!</p>
