<p>Hi friends am 23 year from Dehradun.. am a young guy with lots of dreams.. looking for special friend.. whom i can share my feelings, my dreams, my reality.. my life.. my fear.. my happieness.. my all day stories.. am looking for someone who can  understand me..( vise versa).. my only problem is am expecting too much from people.. now am changing my self day by day..  I know gay life is not that much easy.. Am seeker of love.. i want to go outside with him.. for a long drive.. for hills.. for beach.. want to write my and him name on sand.. ;) i don't want to spend my whole life with unknown people in secret rooms.. i want to do sex with my soulmate.. who first intimate with my soul..</p>
<h1>Lookingfortruefriend</h1>
<h1>Thanksforreading</h1>
<h1>GCI- One simple answer....STOP LOOKING START BECOMING.</h1>
<p>And for this too much romantic post-
1- If u cannot have a check on your expectations then try to understand the psychological reason for it.
2- Sex shaming may land u being alone for your entire life.
3- Try to understand that whether u will be ok with a polyandrous guy, a monoandrous guy or a person with sapiosexual or demisexual traits and where u can enjoy once in a while with a third guy with your partner.
4- Try to address your self issues and understand what exactly are you looking for.</p>
<p>P.S- Once u have decided the menu u would serve, u will get your customers accordingly and when u get the special one then own the cafe with him and make him the next partner along with u.</p>
<p>Goodluck sugarpie!</p>
