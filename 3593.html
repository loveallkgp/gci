<p>hahhaha......
the people from our community want to have respect in society in every form of life and this only can be assured to be obtained from "the society" yes only society the people only will give u respect,respect your job urself and you guys are obviously not seeking for respect form TREES PLANTS ANIMALS..........
THE FIRST COMMENT WHICH MADE me cry like hell the word  "JANANI" From the mouth (someone who said just siting next to me,my brother )after watching that guy on big boss.....what the hell?
i mean to say people here are challenging in a repetitive way that U DO SOMETHING U COME OPEN  U GET THE INTERNATIONAL AWARD THEN SAY SOMETHING AGAINST HIM, then i need to ask,criticizing him needs us a award and what some people admitting him ,needs  what : nothing but baba ji ka thullu...........
comeon how can he only be representing a whole community which is having different type of creatures and shades ,countless even more than uncountable gods in the whole universe.....</p>
<p>he is okay being whatever he is,but he should be sensible enough that the tag connected to him represent a set( :/ ) of people in india....
how can he be so shamelessly dress like a women yes a women only dress like that....just see the night suit of him...................  the way he say " abhi to aur bhi chotee hote jaenge mere kapde" so i want to ask people who are watching big boss what to see you as a whole ur mindset ur views or your legs.....is int "those" websites are enough to fullfill "those" desires.........
HELLL, NOW AFTER I WAS SELECTED AS P.O. IN A REPUTED BANK I THOUGHT TO COME OUT TO my parents ,my relatives but how can i will do that because my buaji,my chachi ji and my maa my brother my entire family friends relatives at some moments see the REALITY (HAHAH...) SHOW.....
seriously life sucks...</p>
