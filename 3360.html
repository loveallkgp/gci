<h1>gci- There is too much zig zag here. He was straight, then he fall in love with you and then he got a gf but he was still with you and now you are afraid of break up. Think practically as to where your future leads you if you carry this current arrangement. Do you see yourself happy and together or do you see separated? I guess it will be easy to figure out for you. Also, try having a talk with him about it.</h1>
