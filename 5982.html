<p>I don't understand one thing, why, nowadays people are pissed off at the Admins? You know, I used to worship this page literally. People used to confess (you know real confessions) until recently I find people confessing farce. Well Admins aren't any GOD so despite living their busy schedule they make time for douchebags like us and help us out. So instead of whining about, RESPECT it. -<em>- You know what? We just nag and do not put ourselves in their position to understand their problems (when a player performs badly we curse them, even worse, but we never understand them) So, for once even try to feel for the Admins and let us make this place again that old confession page which was admired by mane people all over the world. I'm not saying that you guys are pervert because if you read carefully you will see that everywhere I refer to "US" and "WE". It's my humble request to stop cursing the Admins because believe me they are here to help. They don't know anybody personally, our identities are also hidden, so no chance in knowing anybody, so what's the point taunting the poor guys. What they do is clearly help us out from any loopholes. And if you say that they taunt the confessors then please __/_</em> what do you have to say about Mr. Suhel Seth? Well I don't know how many of you guys are from Kolkata, but if you are and if you are a regular follower of The Telegraph then refer to the "SURVIVAL STRATEGIES" of T2. There he literally insults the halfwits and those who come out with "time-wasting" stuffs. To others who don't know who Mr. Suhel Seth is then please if you have watched ZNMD (Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara) there you will find him as Natasha's father. And to those who don't fall in any of the above categories then I'll just say one thing "GOD SAVE THEE".
So please don't misunderstand the Admins, they are one like us only. Try to understand them before putting them at fault.
PS-Don't think I'm Arijit Biswas or any Admin posting this stuff. I'm like one of you from your end! That's all :) ...</p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks dear for such uplifting words...this much empathy is actually too much we ask i guess???</h1>
<p>And when we treat them the way they treat others, they turn protocol police for the admins...
