<p>Hi,Iam 22 yrs from hyd.I met a guy on fb,then went for a casual meet.I liked him and he too.We had a date and he gave 500 kisses.but he had met 4-5 people.The problm is he never said i love u to any one when i asked him  the reason for love he says u look handsome,sexy,decent.Then afterwards i left city he use to call me daily ,msg me saying i love u .but i dont feel loving him bcoz my attractin towards him  is not dat much when i meet him,i am feeling  uncomfortable,i not happy doing romance with him nor with anyone,infact i can enjoy watching a gay porn but previously i used to enjoy watching gay porns want to meet guys,but now i have no desire in him or anyone,i cannot say him that i dont love him,in fact he loves my good looking nature rather then me but he is very hansome guy,i cant unerstand what phase iam in.</p>
<h1>GCI- Are you going through anything in your personal or professional life? Like is there any kind of depression, problem or something that is bothering you? Because these things can effect your mind and make you lose your interest in guys or girls. Figure it out and then come back.</h1>
