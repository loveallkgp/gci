<p>Hello, I am a student from Amity University, Noida, This is not exactly a gay confession but a message to all LGBTs</p>
<p>Just read her Suicide note, Feel like crying, literally
lazerprincess.tumblr.com/post/106447705738/suicide-note</p>
<p>I wish I knew her in real life, She is exactly what I want in a girl, She said she had no friends and no one loved her, I wish I could show her the bright side of life, well its all a wish now, isn't it? A wish that can never be fulfilled.</p>
<p>She's just too beautiful, an angel, hunted by evil Unevolved society,</p>
<p>Surely the scenario will change, If not in 2015, someday in the future, The world is moving slowly and gradually away from religion to a better open-minded system, its too slow but yeah its happening</p>
<p>If anyone of you belongs to the LGBT community, don't take ur life please, Its not worth it, Just don't give a shit and do what you like doing, If people hate you, let them, The harsh truth is- you can't change their mentality and thoughts, no matter what you say or do, they will still stick to traditional ways and will not accept new ways of life but you will definitely find people mature enough to understand you and love you.</p>
<p>I am not one of LGBTs but I love them all, They are my rock, because they do what makes them happy, Fuck with this world.</p>
