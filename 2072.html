<p>Well , its my 3rd confession !
Don't know how should i start . . K k! I'm very emotional , innocent (my friends says ) guy, almost i'm drowned in sorrows ! I'm really v unhappy in my life . Unable to standup ,totally broken ;( All around me , have no respect towards me rather i don't know whats the problem with me towards them? Neither i grew socially , nor i'm able to interact with people around me. I get hurt from them. Feels like i'm in illusion. Some times i feel to hang myself ! Who cares ? All my memories pinch me like hot sharp needle ! Now i feel this life is waste ,as i'm not social , unable communicate , fears , memories , confused , illusioned , ashamed ,insulted ! by many ! Now i feel to have full stop . . Just i felt , someone could help or understand , no boyfriend ! Life is slow poisoning ! Kill me guys ! I hate my life. I wish someone could undertood me. </p>
<h1>GCI- Have you ever done a good deed in your life? You say that you are pretty unfortunate. Well guess what, there are who are even unfortunate than you. Now who are those? The orphan children or the poor children. Why did I mention that? Here it goes... You need a positive feeling in your life. And you can get that if you try to help the really needy people. Spare an hour from your day and visit and orphanage to understand how blessed you are to have good life where you were educated and to have food in your tummy. You really need to see a whole new dimension of your life with a whole new chapter. For now, the suggestion may seem like a total gibberish. You may feel , "what the eff is this guy writing? Is he nuts?" But when you go out and actually practice it you WILL feel the difference in your head.</h1>
