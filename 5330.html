<p>hello every one i have a confusion please resolve it .
m gay , my voice is soft and i know it , but when i talk to gays or bi they ask m i girlish ??
m not but they say from ur voice it seems . on the other hand my straight frnds nd straight people whom i talk they compliment that i have a nice nd soothing voice quality nd they say surely m having two or three gfs .
i just want to ask why gays do this wid me nd wen i say m vers they say u r bot , but m not nd till now m i had no anal experience . i really hate gays for this widout watching me just talking me on cell they speak bullshit thats why i dont have nd dont want any gay frnd specially girlish guys (mujhe to darr vi lgta hai inse jaisi inki harkate hoti hai , why dont they get transformed in trans , i mean m sorry do not want to hurt anyone but i think its better for them na ) please respond yar. thank u alll</p>
<h1>GCI- You sounded like "I don't want to be offensive <says something offensive>." Even if you say something like this, it is still offensive. Coming to your case, do not let others define you. If they say anything about your character, tell them "don't be opinionated if you don't know me."</h1>
<p>It is true that gay people all over the world are very much opinionated and judgmental when it comes to looks, behavior, voice and the way a person carries himself. You cannot do anything about it because this quality is transferred from one person to another by observation.</p>
<p>Last thing that I want to say is that being girly is not equal to being trans. Trans is a someone who not comfortable with their biological sex. They feel like they are in a wrong body. If someone is girly, they can be comfortable with their dick and balls. Not every girly guy needs a vagina. Sex change is an option only for trans people, not for gays. Hope you got me now?</p>
