<p>India is a country of rich diversity so called "vibhintaa me ekta" during my childhood life i came across the physical relations with my cousins ;at that time i don't know what was that. but I enjoyed it with pain that thing knocked my mind oh aisaa bhi kuchh hota i started having physical relations at that small age both girls n my male cousins but as i grow i think that this is wrong (social stigma with it KISI NE DEKH LIYA TO KYA HOGA) after that i reduced the frequency to meet such kind of people n finally up to no.... but after some time again entered into this side there is an intense desire to be having physically with someone n keep thinking about that and than after having masturbation all things go away n start thinking oh that wrong what i am doing yaar now condition is like that i like it but i dont like it.......</p>
<h1>GCI- How does unity in diversity fit into the context of your confession? Anyways, do not feel bad about having physical relations. They will only make you go down on an emotional level. Maybe you feel guilty about it because you haven't tried a relationship yet. Once you are in one you cannot feel bad about having physical with the one you love. Do everything guilt free! Life is too short to feel guilty about having sex.</h1>
