<p>Many might not understand my situation, even mock at me and find it a useless issue but I really need help regarding this as I am in big big dilemma for last 4-5 years. I recently got attached to an spiritual organisation and started going there. They are of the opinion that intercourse even with female gender is a vice. Lust in any form is vice according to them. This thing has influenced and affected my mind very much, I mean very very much. I can't watch girls as normal guys and friends do, can't fantasize, that's why I haven't got physical with a girl even till now whereas friends of my age have gone into that thing many years before, I am 24 by the way. People are shocked and surprised when they get to know that I haven't dated a single girl in my life( I look good and smart, am well educated and decent enough (others opinion and feedback, not bluffing :-P ). But now, even if I sleep with a girl, I think I would never have that feeling and that lustful sensation, I think my Dick won't even erect if I sleep or get intimate with a girl. they have brain washed my mind completely, can you please suggest something so that I can regain the motivation and the zeal back in life? its hampering my whole life and career as I cannot concentrate on my studies, as there is no motivational factor in my life. Due to this ,I just spend most of my life within the four walls and I have stopped enjoying life, please help out.</p>
<h1>GCI : i am not very religious person so i will put my pint toward ..rest of people can put theirs. spirituality to me is ' finding yourself and having control on your senses ' . but these spiritual organisations or religious organisations don't teach you to control senses but they instead numb your senses .</h1>
<p>religion has declared all the good things which give you happiness as 'sin' thus puts seeds in your mind that god will judge you if you do any of these things 'sex ' being one. sex is natural . god has made everything for a reason and that is meant to be used . 
any feeling which is suppressed and isn't fed today will not die but instead will start becoming stronger and one day when it will burst it will do more harm . religion suppress freedom </p>
<p>its not like you have to have sexual feeling towards every women ..and having few intimate  relationships with few people with their consent is not a bad thing . go out .. do the dating and marry a girl you like , make a family . have control on senses but don't suppress them</p>
