<p>Hi. I'm from Gujarat. And this is my story till date. I knew it from 12th grade that I was more attracted to men than to women. But it was just a staring kinda attraction. I had no physical or fantasical fetish for men then. I developed gay contacts thru social portals thenafter. I was confused for the fact that whether I want sex from guys or a serious relationship. I didn't had much hookups though I've met many guys. And mind you, I haven't had anal sex with anyone till date. But, now the most tragic part begins. In 2012, I was in a so called relationship with a guy. He had even been to my home on my birthday that year. My parents had a doubt at that time as to why is this guy a friend of our son. This is because I was shy and introvert since I was schooling. I had a very few or let's say no friends. And I had been a home boy since years. So this was a good reason for my parents to doubt upon me. But that's not the only thing. In the same year I had naughty chats on fb wiht random guys. And one day, my brother read all the texts because my account was logged in. This was a storm for me. I was at the edge of a knife then. I controlled the situation anyhow. But then, again it happened in 2013. I was close to this guy and he was mad after me and he wanted me to text him 24X7. And our conversational chats were again read by my brother. During both these times, it was my fault that I forgot to logout. But this mistake has ruined my life completely. And I disliked the fact that my bro went on to my parents saying them that I was chatting such stuff with guys on fb. Instead he could have come to me in private, demanding justification. I swear I could have convinced him that nothing was wrong. At that time my family thought I'm mentally unstable. I don't want my parents to know about me. So I had to stick on to the fact that was straight. So these 2 happenings in 2 years have utterly changed my life like never before. I don't meet anyone now. I don't go anywhere. I don't hang around with anyone. I've so very went down into the closet. During this navratri, I was suffering from acute depression. I have cried all the nights long. This is my appeal to guys who are trying to come out to their families. I know not all families are overconscious and oversensitive like mine, but think it 100 times before doing anything. Because your silly mistake can change your life forever. Even today, when I have a minor quarrel with my mom or bro, they end up saying, "Shut the fuck up, you're a bloody gay and that's a shame." 
But never mind. Its my family. And I love them. Thank you. God Bless.</p>
<h1>GCI : HMM .. first thing i want to clear that when somebody confess here that they are gay or that they had attraction towards men as kid , i never assume that '' yes they must have had anal'',orhad sex with guys.  knowing that you are gay is not a physical phase but more of psychological phase . you don't need to sleep with guy to ensure that you are gay or not. you just know it. some kids know it even at a tender age .</h1>
<p>i understand you and your situation . see you brother is immature and without any doubt his stand was very kiddish . don't expect that he will stand by you if you came out . and your parents , see this concept is totally new , totally alien . even if they want to they can't understand . because they aren't aware , they haven't  done a research on it so they will always think it as disease or hormonal stage or medical disability or even a VOODOO ( yeas indeed) .</p>
<p>see only person who need to accept himself is you . you are grownup man , take the charge be yourself take a stand for yourself.  don't let your parents decisions or your brothers ignorance stand between your happiness , between your life .</p>
