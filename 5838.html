<p>I went through some confession of this page and i saw people asking or doubting on sexuality of their close person. okay then if you guys want to know or recognize if your friend/cousin is gay or not you have to do/know this things..</p>
<p>there are no definite physical
signs that prove a person is gay. Being interested in men does not mean
he's not interested in women and his sexuality is his business..</p>
<p>but still if you want to know then
pay attention how he talks about men.
Don't ask everyone you know if that
person is gay. Don't scrutinize the person's style. See how the person reacts to the topic
of LGBT people. See how the person reacts to the
opposite sex. see who are his friends..
check out his fb,instagram..</p>
<p>ask them if they know any gay person and see he reacts. Don't ever ask them if they are gay. Wait for
them to trust you and the answer will
eventually come out.</p>
<p>this may help you guys.. :) but it is very  hard to find out a sexuality of a bisexual guy as he's interested in both gender and he has maintained it so that none will know it..</p>
<h1>GCI- SIGH!!!! u wont find many bi-loving folks here!</h1>
<p>BUT who cares!!!</p>
