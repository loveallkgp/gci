<p>HI EVERYONE
Guys how does it feel when u just give a normal look at a guy and he invites u for sex at the very next moment...bcoz I face it every other day..I dont give weird or luring looks..but guys in groups or with their friend find it amusing to ask for a sexual favour by whistling or by chasing,its scary and creepy sometimes..feeling of safety is put to a question mark sometimes if it happens at nyt..opinions?</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh that is pretty creepy to even think about. That reminds me one of my incident when I was walking in a park in my hometown and two guy went past by me and scanned every inch of my body through their eyes. I immediately walked towards my scooter and went back home. I felt naked at that time. They have freaks like these everywhere. Mostly you ignore them and don't pay much attention. If they try to cross a limit, it doesn't hurt to create a scene at the spot. I did it once in my school.</h1>
