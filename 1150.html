<p>Admin! well i dont knw how to start.., i had a lover nd we were in luv for past 4 years! we were in same junior school..! now i'm in 2nd year of university education, i came abroad for my studies nd he's in chennai..! i stopped talking to him and we broke up few months before. he never ever got anger over me for anything, trusted me and loved me a lot, even i did too !!but the problem is he loves me more than his parents, and of course.. he's a straight guy! he loves me more than anything... as by profession and for family i would get married in the future! i dont like him loving me more than anyone sply parents1 so i ended up.. i told him many times, he didnt listen at all!
