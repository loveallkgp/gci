<p>well i was in 10th standard and our boilogy teacher was teaching a chapter on reproduction, that chapter, you know it's well written but it still lacks something, so our teachers asked us to ask any question, so many questions were asked, including flavoured condoms, i-pills etc. some questions were also related to transgender and she told us about that too, then you know it was me only in the whole class who asked about homosexuality and homosexual sex, it was quiet apparent that such questions were unexpected and everyone looked at me , then finally i was given an explanantion but that didn't give 100% information...sometimes i think when it comes to homosexual topic, even teachers don't want to discuss about it,  my dream is too work for shaping of education policy and if that happens one day and i think there should be a topic on homosexuality in sex education, plus students must be taught why people become homosexuals and it's not a fault to become  homo, education must play a role to destroy the LGBT-phobia  in students...</p>
<h1>GCI : good thinking and even i want to make effort . i wished when i was in school i also should have talked on these topics but again our teachers would only teach syllabus and won't talk on extras .</h1>
