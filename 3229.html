<p>hlww...want to share something.. actually last days I used to imagine a life where I would have a lot of gay friends n a special one for me then my fb made my dream partially true .. on d very begining on fb chat I got a friend whom I found may be somthing special...this special thing was may be because of my excitement to chat with a gay person..i was so happy but I think that person was habituated in such acts....day passed on we had lots of chat mess...one day he said he developed real love for me that feeling which was never going to be false I was also happy.... the main thing is do I really like him or thats my infatuation due to excitement???? oh god I dont wanna leave someone giving such kind of pain.....everytime I think abt him isuddenly I get a text or acll of him...what to do next???</p>
