<p>Okay .
This is my third confession in this page in a span of 48 hours.I am not jobless but the forum is too liberating.
Well the story goes like this.I went on an abroad trip with a random group of people,one friend of mine and a bunch of others who were friends of friends.Never met them before.
I remember spotting this really hot guy in the airport and I immediately felt attracted.Surprisingly he and i bonded amazingly well and connected at a different level.
He is straight as an arrow but as fate had it on the last night we went to a place where there was a dearth of rooms. We had to sleep in pairs.He and I chose the same room because we connected so well as friends.
During the night I had slept off when all of a sudden I felt uncomfortable.I woke up to find that he hugged me tight and he seemed to be sleeping.It never went beyond the hug but trust me I have never felt better in my entire life.
The trip ended.We keep in touch but sporadically.He lives in Australia now so we dont get to meet.
But somehow this is one incident I will really cherish.</p>
