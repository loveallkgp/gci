<p>I am "A" from confession number #6055</p>
<p>Consider this - I am out to my friends and parents. Have told my parents that I wont marry a girl. I know it is wrong to make hell of a girl's life. I love B. I love B more than my life. For 3 long years, I tried to persuade him that he should not marry a girl. He said, keep out of my life. He also said that he'll never forgive me if I ever let his secret out. He said, if u truly love me, then let me set up my new life. I dont even want to remember you.
I told him that what if eventually everyone comes to know. He said, I shouldnt bother about it. So I left him to his fate, and promised for the sake of my love that, I will go away from is life.</p>
<p>I came close to C. C isnt my boyfriend. And he cannot be. I would be cheating on him if I accept him as my boyfriend. He is a very good friend, who is very caring. And C's cousin is getting married to B. Now what should A do?
Is it still A's mistake that B is marrying a girl?
Please read #6055 before this one to get the whole context.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay I read the whole thing. Forget that there was a guy named B in your life and that you love him. Imagine that your sister or your cousin is getting married and the guy that she is getting married to, is gay. You got to know that through one of your contacts. What would you do? Would you let her marry the guy with whom she has no future or interfere?</h1>
<p>Now coming to your A B and C, whatever B is doing, he is messing his life up and in turn he is putting the blame onto A to lower his guilt. But as a human A cannot just let it watch. Letting someone's life getting ruined is most inhuman act ever. You know what to do now. I would expose that bastard if I were you. Being forgiven or not but if I cannot see my own sister getting married to a gay guy, I shouldn't see anything like that happening to any other girl. Girls are not the objects for gay people to hide their identity.</p>
