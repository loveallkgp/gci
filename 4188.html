<p>Hello everyone, I am from Nepal(le admin me connait bien haha) I just wanted to say, that Idk why I find this page intellectually interesting and more active than these Nepali confession pages I see. The admin seems to be a good counselor. I love all posts. Moreover, I have found very intelligent gay people on this page, which I have not yet encountered easily here in this fake id.</p>
<p>Everyone wants sex. I made this id, not so long ago. However, i have met few people who are different and emotionally comforting, many come up on messages with 'where are you?' 'Are you top or bottom?' 'What do you like?'. I am tired of hearing all this really. I am 19, virgin and I am glad! I think most gay people in South Asia are already desperately withdrawn. Someone said 'I will marry a girl but i will be in a secret relationship with guys'. What do you think? Will you come out? Will you marry a girl for your family's sake? What if your parents do not accept you? What strategies do you have? And I am so tired with these lines that sound nothing more than filled with hypocrisy 'Go live your life' 'Damn care what they say' 'it's your life' I mean it's not that easy as it is in saying these things.</p>
<h1>GCI- We are not counselors at all. We are just two guys who have life experiences and want to share it with the people.</h1>
<p>PS- No french. There is just too much french in Montreal. :'(</p>
