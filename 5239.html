<p>5103 confessor,i am 27,I had a crush on this guy when I saw his pic for the first time , he is a public figure(a well educated n a very handsome model) so I knew him but he didn't know me..after around 10 years I sent a friend request to him on fb n he accepted..I said thank u n he said welcome that's it ..n hvnt chatted at all for few years..i couldnt start becoz I had no idea about his orientation ..during this time I got into a relationship with this awesome guy who takes care of me n loves me like anything n I love him too ..but we were in long distance relationship but still very happy ...out of nowhere I got a message from this guy( model) on fb n started chatting n he invited me at his house..I paid a visit n it turned out he had this strong feeling of love n connection after our first meeting...tbh I acted on my infatuation so we kissed n made out on 2nd meeting..after one week I told him I already have a bf..he got a shock n got so mad n sad..so he decided to cut our connection...I felt bad for him n I cried seeing how hurt he was on our last break up meeting ..never thought he would be that sensitive considering his profession n his looks n all..I thought we are over but after 2 days of our break up he called up crying n telling me the pain is too much to bear n he felt like breaking his head coz the memories of us were haunting him..so he said he feel ashamed to do this( call me) but he can't help he misses me every moments ..considering what I did to him I m responsible for that so I told him I ll take care of you .I went n meet him n I consoled him after that he felt better...but after I left at nite time he would cry n called me that he misses me n the pain is excruciating n he is even worried if he goes into depression ..he even snapped at his mom and had fight with friends on petty matters out of frustrations..I m trying my best to console him n let him move on but my being with him makes him feel better n normal..that's the only way he feels good n he wants but I thought being with him will create more memories so I tried cutting of but he goes back to depression again, he needs me n ..so we continue like this for few weeks ..he has improved a lot but still loves me like crazy ...I don't know what to call this relationship but whatever it is helping him to be happy...m I really helping him?? ultimately I will settled with my bf</p>
