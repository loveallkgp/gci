<p>I was dating a guy online for 7 months and loved each other. We exchanged pics in which he looked straight. So i agreed to meet him in public cafe. But when he came i was terrified. He was skinny effeminate wearing tight tshirt and even voice was girly. People were staring at us and maybe even thought i was gay. I asked him to act normally since I was in closet at which he started abusing me. It was worst expereince and I had to leave as people were looking. I will never talk to a girly gay again. I hate them big time.</p>
<h1>GCI- It's good that he abused you. You deserved that.</h1>
