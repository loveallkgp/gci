<p>Hello friends ...</p>
<p>This one is for all u youngsters out there who are not just confused as well as depressed ...</p>
<p>guys have we ever thought the main reason of our depression ?? U all might have different-different complains about ur life which u might be depressed about . But u know what the real reason is behind depression ?? The only and the only reason behind pur depression is our own self . We are the root cause of everything . U might be really pissed off by now . But hey wait .. just know why are we all the only reason of our depression .. guys we always complain about our environment to be bad , pathetic and horrible . But havebwe guys ever thought of accepting our present forgetting our past and caring for our better future ?? Guys why do we live in so much of presure . Guys analyse ur self ..analyse ur capabilities . Analyse what u are mean of and for . Fear is not the end of our life . Infact our real world starts after fighting against our fears ... no body can ever snatch ur breathe away . Just live in ur present . Guys our present is our future . Belive in ur self . If u can't help ur self then even god can't help u .. we need to be strong . And we should learn to accept our self .. but never accept ur self for being wrong .... few people are depressed because they are being teased every now and then . Few are dperessed because they can't let anyone know who they are .. friends come out of it all .... breathe look at the blue sky man ... guys . Just be who u are .. only the sweetest fruits are hit by stones ... guys for any living creature his self respect , his principles &amp; morals lead him to the path of treasure no matter he is a gay or straight or a bisexual . Never waste ur life time on such a small atomic materialistic pleasure . Because life is like a long thar road to walk on . Guys ... never loose ur dignity or ur self respect just to make ur self look cool or to enjoy any sort of materialistic pleasure . Pleasure might be for a while but the regret of loosing ur self respect and dignity will always haunt u till the end . I m not against sex . I like sex too . But I like my self respect to , I care for my dignity . And I know I m not a product to be sold . But I m a human being to be respected for my exsistence in this world ... sex might get u to the 9th cloud but after u are done in a night i ll just throw u right down to the sea level ... .. when sexual desperation is being expresed in a public platform it not just make us look imoral . But we all have been seen as a whore .. ww are taken as an open invitation to get sexual frustration out on ....because of few desperate sex seeker we all are abused to be a whore . Guys having a sexual arousals or fantasices is very common but standing in the middle of the raod seducing straights with dirtu expresions make us look even worse for no reason ....hope u ll read it and imply it to ur self .... ur well wishers ..</p>
