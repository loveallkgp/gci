<p>Dear dev singh</p>
<p>Its me again, dude I agree that my words were harsh and you didn't even get what I wanted to say :p</p>
<p>So heres it for you another time in some soft words :p</p>
<p>See m not saying that you dont have the right to comment or anything, my point is when you write something please think once or research what you are writing, cos it might be your personal opinion but you are doing it on social networking site, which makes it available for others to read as well n affects others thinking, specially when you write so big as if you know everything, n we all are wrong sometimes please dont take it to your ego n as far as those asses goes, who are saying people cant take things, this guy has never commented bad on my posts, but my opinion is based on his comments on all the posts that I have read so far....</p>
<p>You can still comment on my post saying something blah blah blah or may be write one more confession for me or I HAVE GOT A BETTER IDEA, WHY DONT YOU JUST THINK BEFORE YOU WRITE,</p>
<p>Hope that you wil be able to take it in right spirit n wont get carried away by the comments of others...</p>
<p>with love :* </p>
<h1>Viv- Here's an idea for you both. Despite of sending confessions like this and arguing on a public platform to take your grudges out, why don't you both argue in the comment sections like mature men?</h1>
<p>And guys, if you don't agree with someone's comments say it then and there only. But then again, why do you expect someone to have thinking to the likes of you? Unless the guy is hitting your head with his comments engraved on the wooden block, you got nothing to worry about.</p>
