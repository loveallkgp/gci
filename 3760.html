<p>Dearest admin. I am Prateek here. Lots of sweet kissi for u on the lippi. I want to ask you one question ok babbu? My bff has both penni and vaggi since birth. The penni is very small and dont get big when he think of dirty things. He scared to kiss anyone or do dirty thingy because he think he will get a baby. Can people with both penni and vaggi get baby? He shy to ask his mama or doctor uncle. Bye. lots of love babbu</p>
<h1>GCI : hello prateek :D . lots of love to you dear .</h1>
<p>see your friend is hermaphrodite ( a person having  reproductive organs of bot male and female ) . 
there are so many questions you can ask  to your friend like?</p>
<ol>
<li>does your friend consider himself as male/female ?</li>
<li>if your friend considers himself as male then does he identify himself as gay man or straight man ?</li>
<li>secondly does his both organs penis and vagina functional ? from where he get orgasm ? can your friend get impregnated  or impregnate someone ?</li>
<li>do he got female physique or male physique ?</li>
</ol>
<p>as you said 'he' its obvious he considers himself as male . and his mother must be knowing about it . its impossible that parent don't know about their kids sex.  so he shall first talk to his parents and the go to a capable good doctor for further talks . he shall visit a doctor to consult for his sexual life . and there is no wrong in being a hermaphrodite , tell him not to be shy .</p>
