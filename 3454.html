<p>Need suggestion:- </p>
<p>I am 29year old .. while i was in school and college i never tried to have sex with any guy.. after completing college i did find some sex partners.. i fucked 3-4 times and enjoyed a lot. i lost interest in sex for around 2years and didnt had any encounter and just satisfied myself by hand. during this period I studied a lot about incurable STDs that transmit even after use of condom during penetration and about AIDS. Now after this break when i try to have sex with someone i don't get full erection and i am unable to insert it into my bottom.. i feel defeated and depressed due to this.. i am unable to understand is this my terror, or my Age or My excessive Masturbation habits, due to which i am not getting full erection.</p>
<h1>GCI- How can I say anything because I am not living in your brain. You have to figure it out yourself man.</h1>
