<h1>GCI- Oh honey, you are eating your feelings. That's the worst thing you could do. I do it but I still don't put on the weight. Don't let your sexuality be a negative aspect of your life. You cannot change it so better wear it as a crown. You are still not at peace from within. You have to know that it is okay. We will get to a good place in future. Don't just sit back and feel awful.</h1>
<p>As far as your weight is concerned, you can do some exercises at your home. Crunches, leg ups etc, just look them up and control your diet if you want to loose weight.</p>
