<p>hiii all
 there is a teacher in my class who is very sweet but  whenevr tuo guys are speaking to each other in the class the teacher always says to them bhai tum theek ho na .. as in  he hint towards gays and i dont like it  i guess its a homophobe comment by d way i had a crush on that teacher  though he is ok ok types but i guess can he can satisfy me . i send him i love you wala message through fake id i wrote iam a student of ur class but i didnt mentioned my name and he didnt replied  . if i would have been girl i would have directly said him sir u  r not that smart but iam attracted to u will u fuck me??</p>
<h1>GCI- Woah bitch....i was actually impressed at ur audacity on what u think....</h1>
<p>Listen if ur teacher is a homophobe..then find it out..its not rocket science...just try to bring any gay themed issue and u will get to know..and then act accordingly.</p>
<p>I still can't believe I used to flirt with my teacher and he used to turn pink...Gawwwdddd those were really the 'days'.</p>
