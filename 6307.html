<p>Hello guys! I am Prithvi, a 24 year old guy from New Delhi staying in Gurgaon for the past 4 years.</p>
<p>I have never been in any relationship with anyone so far. There have been 2-3 strong crushes but then nothing materialized. I have never wanted to jump into any relation because I want that before a relationship, I must share friendship with my guy which should sustain for good number of years.</p>
<p>Being very honest, i do make sexual dates about once in two months. About 3 and a half years ago, I met a guy Jai from social media who worked as corporate dance trainer for few companies in Gurgaon. Our chats made us friends even before we could meet. We liked each others talks n we often talked on phone.. like after any 2-3 hours. We really wanted to meet but we were busy with our work. And we shared an absolute good bond of frenship. After a month of such cute frenship, once I received a text "This wasn't expected that you'll spread my numbers with boys. Take care"</p>
<p>Thought he's kidding, but he wasn't. I had not reverted immediately, but when I received no further text for that entire day, I called him to explain that this is not true. He never believed me then and everything went beserk. He never responded properly to my texts and finally I gave up!</p>
<p>After about 4 months, at midnight 3 AM, I received a call from him. Waking up from sleep, I asked yeah say Jai... he said "Are you sleeping" I said yes... he said okay..gud night. After he repeated this excercise thrice, I asked "Dude..are u drunk?"</p>
<p>Thats when he said yes and he started requesting me to plz help him as he is scared and needs me at all costs. I got shocked...I had to work really hard that day in midnight to bring that drunk guy at my room...can't elaborate its a huge story. Once he came to my room, I asked him to sleep but he said he wants me. Despite my various refusals, he was reluctant to leave me. We then slept together kissing and cuddling. No make outs. In the morning, he shouts at me because he got late. Lol! What I could have done? I also got late to my work because of which I was bashed by my boss. After 2 days he sent me a text saying thank you and post that never replied to my text if at all I did.</p>
<p>I never bothered to contact him again but its been years and I cannot forget him. I always cherish that night....because that was super beautiful. All the talks we had..the way he behaved... the way he never wanted to leave me... He's a great guy and I think I really like him. One misunderstanding ruined my frenship with him. So guys, always express your feelings to the people you love...so that you don't have to regret it later...</p>
<p>I saw him today...he looked as cute as ever. Obviously I didn't walk up to him, but I really miss him</p>
<h1>GCI- You miss the guy who accused you of something false and created a whole lot of drama? What are you, like a 15 year old teenage girl?</h1>
