<p>Hi #GCI</p>
<p>I have been reading your page for quite some time now but this is the first time that I am actually saying something.</p>
<p>But before I go into the that, I want to say that what you are doing is amazing. I do not know what is the reach of your page or how many people view your page but I am sure that you reach more people than any other organization in India (I even remember a confession from Pakistan once).</p>
<p>I don't know whether you realize this it or not -I like to think that you do- but you are helping the LGBT community in one of the best ways. You listen to what they have to say and give them your advice. And I salute you for that.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are witty (and I love your sense of humor), sometimes you are serious (I also love the way you use the words of adoration like 'dear' or 'darling' to soften the blow and do not sound cheesy or creepy). And sometimes (less than 1%) you are down right asshole, but I have to give credit to you, it is not easy to read other people's problems and give them advice when you are dealing with your own.</p>
<p>All in all, call it hero worship or any other thing, but I really really love what you do and your work. Truth be told, I could never do what you are doing.</p>
<p>Now, that you have had a healthy dose of flattery(:D, Also for those who do not understand sarcasm I'd like to explain that I did not mean to flatter the admin) I'll continue with what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>I am not sure what I am i.e. in which category I fall. I know that I am not straight because man I like cute boys! But at the same time I have never had a crush on a boy before but have had one or two on girls. Also, I have never fantasized about a girl(I feel somehow its derogatory to them) but have had many about boys(yes, I know it is very hypocritical). As such, I 'think' that I am a bisexual. But this is not my confession.</p>
<p>That being said, in my fantasies(we all fantasize after all) and in a sexual encounter I visualize myself or see myself as a bottom. And in rare cases(and I mean really really rare) I see myself as a top, but that in not often.</p>
<p>Now, I am not most sexually active person and I am still afraid to venture too much in the world as a gay man but I have few experiences(The number is very very less, if I were to say it out loud, I am sure many would burst out laughing). And in all of them I have been the bottom.</p>
<p>Now, I don't know whether gay sex is all hype or not, but I did not like it much. I was surprisingly disappointing. So, what i am saying is that I do not know what I am now, if I were bisexual, then wouldn't I have enjoyed it as much as everyone who apparently 'loved it'?</p>
<p>So, my question is, does that happens with other people too or am I sole victim of this condition?</p>
<p>I hope I get an a reply(even if its not an answer) from you #GCI because sometimes you do not reply and just post the confession.</p>
<h1>GCI- Omg, your words made me wet! Thanks for the appreciation.</h1>
<p>Well sex is not everybody's thing. Some people like it, while some not. Sexuality depends upon your physical, emotional and romantic attraction towards either one or both sexes. Physical is just one part of it. It's entirely upon you what you want to do. Do not get confused by it much.</p>
