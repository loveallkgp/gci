<p>its already been 2 months since i had made my first confession here and believe me its going really smooth as i have thought of..now he (my-crush) and i have started hanging out a lot, have started drinking together , clubbing and strolling around streets. BUT just as friends..i still have a huge feelings for him but dont know if he feels the same for me. how can i figure him out? how could i know about his feelings? i just cant go straight and ask what he feels for me that would be kinda awkward ..HELP!</p>
<h1>Viv- You can't live on just speculations or dreams. You want to know about his feelings, first make him comfortable and then ask him. Know how he feels about gay people and then plan your move.</h1>
