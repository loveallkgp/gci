<p>hey guysss its my first confession.
I am a PTI &amp; 24 year old .Actually i dont know how to start .
Ok i am in relationship with my student. he is very sweet, caring &amp; ofcourse handsome . Everything was going good but suddenly my father fix my marriage. The reason is he is heart patient and want me to see settled. I have no choices.
When i told my lover about my marriage he just said OK and went away. The very next day i got the news of his suicide attempt. ( thank god he is safe )
I tried to talk to him but he refused . I just want to clear it all. Plz dont take me wrong but i love my father coz he is my whole family . What should i do ?
I want to see him happy also .
Help me guysss.</p>
<h1>GCI- Yikes. That's a complicated situation. Maybe talk to the girl and figure things out? Your father cannot do with shocks buddy. At one side you have your father and on the other side you have your partner. Maybe what you can do is break the news on dad in pieces. Or take some help from an NGO. That way your dad will not be much shocked if you come out to him. Yes it be a disappointment for him but all he wants his your happiness. Make him understand that you cannot be happy if you marry a girl. You are working, you have a nice job and you have a partner. If you easily say these things to him then his fear may go away.</h1>
