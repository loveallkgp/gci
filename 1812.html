<p>Hi admin,
I want to confess something. I am almost 29 years old and work in a permanent position. I have a bf and we are in a LDR sort of. 'Coz both of us live in different cities.
I live in a shared accommodation with three other people. Two guys and a gal. One of the guy, say Raj and the gal say Neha are in a relationship. That guy is like my younger brother. Whenever he drinks, he tries to hide it from me as kid tries to hide it from his dad. Whenever he had any problems in their relationship he would always come to me.
Few weeks before, he had a big fight with his gf. He came to my room and I listened to him. He cried in my arms. Then I put him to bed as he was quite drunk. Next morning was my day off. I was lying in bed late. He had to go to work. He came to my room and said something, I can't remember. Then he kissed me on the lips. And though i was very much awake I didnt make a move. I always had a crush on him but always parked my high horses. Now it seemed impossible.
I tried to kiss him on the lips one day and he moved away. And said that what the hell am I doing? What you guys think.
PS: I was not with my bf when all this happened. We got back together just few days back. I already told him about this.</p>
<h1>Viv- Maybe he was just being affectionate because you consoled him the previous night. Although I have never really heard about a straight guy lip kissing another guy as a goodwill gesture. Buuuttt, long story short, stay away from him. If you do anything, you are gonna hurt a lot of people.</h1>
