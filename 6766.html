<p>anyone who is working with lgbtq social organisations this is for u and also for the rest of the gay population ......we need to educate people that homosexuality is not a CHOICE OR A LIFESTYLE THIS IS HOW THE NATURE CREATED US AND HARD WIRED OUR BRAIN IT IS NOT RELATED TO OUR WILL POWER OR ANY KIND OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL INFLUENCE ....MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN INDIA NOW KNOW ABOUT GAYS BUT THEY THINK THAT ITS AN OPTION TO BE GAY OR NOT,OR  IT IS S A BAD HABIT OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE OF WHICH SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY STUPID THINGS WE NEED TO DRAW THE ATTENTION OF INDAN INTELLECTUAL POPULATION WHICH IS OPEN ,NEW AND EDUCATED.IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS AND SO CAN WE ....ITS SURPRISING THAT EVEN (NON-LGBTQ )PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT GAY RIGHTS IN INDIA USUALLY STATES THAT ITS ONE'S PERSONAL LIFE AND CHOICE ....BUT ITS NOT  ITS NOT IT IS SOOO NOT !!! WHY WE ARE FAILING TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT OURSELVES WE ARE NATURAL WE ARE CREATED BY NATURE THIS WAY IF THEY FORCE US TO CHANGE (WHICH NOT POSSIBLE IN ANY WAY) THAT  IS  AGAINST NATURE. MANY PEOPLE IN INDIA SHOW TREMENDOUS ANGER WHEN ANY COMMUNAL FORCE TRY TO IMPOSE RELIGIOUS BOUNDATIONS IN THE NATION MANY PEOPLE ARE AGAINST FEMALE DISCRIMINATION WHICH IS MOSTLY DONE BY RELIGIOUS AND SO CALLED CULTURAL  IGNORANTS .SO IF THESE INTELLECTUAL YOUNG EDUCATED PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED ABOUT LGBT PEOPLE WHAT ANSWER WILL THEY HAVE TO DENY OUR RIGHTS THEY ARE NOT THAT RELIGIOUS THEY ARE NOT THAT SO CALLED CULTURAL CUZ IF THEY ARE THEN FOLLOW RELIGION AND CULTURE 100 % AND IMPOSE ALL STUPID RELIGIOUS CULTURAL LAWS IN INDIA GOING AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION . I KNOW THAT THEY WONT AND CANT .SO IF THEY R EDUCATED AND INTELLECTUAL AND UNDERSTANDING THEN AFTER KNOWING OUR CONDITIONS OUR NATURAL NATURE THEY WILL CHANGE WE JUST NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT OURSELVES I AM NOT SAYING THE CHANGE IS GONNA COME SOON BUT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE STRATEGY RATHER SCREEMING RIGHTS FOR OUR PERSONAL LIFE/CHOICES WE NEED TO SHOW OUR TRUE SELVES .OUR BASIC RIGHTS NOT RIGHTS BUT THE BASIC RIGHTS THAT'S WHAT SUPREME COURT WANTS  US TO DO EDUCATE THE SOCIETY START CONVERSATIONS IN AN INTELLECTUAL SCIENTIFIC WAY PEOPLE WILL COME FORWARD TO SUPPORT US ....... THATS WHAT I THINK .</p>
