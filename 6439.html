<h1>GCI- Girl, he is overreacting? Really queen? You have to check on your behavior first and then say something about him. If you are in a relationship, the person will feel bad if his partner behaves like you. You have to figure out if you want love or lust. Then crawl back to him on your knees, kiss his pee-pee and apologize. You hearing me, boo?</h1>
