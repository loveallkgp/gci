<h1>Viv- That gay guy had a girlfriend? How? Like Hoooowwwwww? Of course he wanted to be the part of the mainstream society but the truth can't be denied. You can respond to him but maintain the distance. Don't get physical until he speaks what he feels about you and promises to not use you for pleasure.</h1>
