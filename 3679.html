<p>hello .. very good evening ..
i found this page very useful and good one to confess .
I just wanna say 1 thing that I have been here in this fake profile since 4 years.. Still i have not get anything what exactly i need. I have been searching n searching , but no use. 99% guys are here only for SEX... 99% of guys who use to massage me will ask whether I am top or bottom. I really hate this question . and more over I exactly in a need of true , honest, good, lovable, person who can give me a care and love till my last breath . I know its not possible but i want to make it possible. i just fed up by searching and searching.. I have got many proposals but no one deserve that position because all will stay a week and then asks for a sex.. Bloody idiots.. i Know its not possible to find a person like that.. I will not give an importance to beauty or money.. exactly a guy should be educated a bit and have to hold my hand till my death .. he should not marry any girl.. he should be with me... I also have a dream of marrying a guy .. but its not at possible to search a guy like that.. no one is ready for this.. I feel very disappointed when i think about me and my life..
Thank you dear admin... for such good platform to say my feelings. Exactly i don't want to share this but today i couldn't able to control myself.. </p>
