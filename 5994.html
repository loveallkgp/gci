<p>I need advise from the admins and other people. I m a 21 year old gay guy. At the moment i m doing my bachelor and will move away for traineeship/work to another city 600km from where i live. My childhood friend confessed to me when we were just 18 that he had fell in love with me. He is my first guy and the first person that i love. We have a secret relationship but my best female friends knows (she guessed). My parents are conservative and my dad is very old fashioned. I have tried to tell him but he does not get it. So what i want to do is move away and my boyfriend wants to get a job at the same city. When we are together and settled i want to tell my parents and grandparents but he also wants to tell his family. Now i have been told by a friend that i should tell now and before i go away. He tells me that i need to confess to my parents, sister and family. But i just need some weeks to finish my exams and then i will move. That i m gay and proud and want to be open who i am is not a discussion for me. I m just confused at the moment. If i tell now there will be a lot of problems in my family but also in the family of my boyfriend. Can i get some advise please?</p>
