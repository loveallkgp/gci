<p>This is my 2nd confession
I 45yrs am in touch with a bisexual guy 24-25 yrs old guy since 2mths. We hardly discussed about sex but rest other things like hobbies future past likings tastes interests n what not. I started falling for him as very few sensible n decent guys we meet in our life.. We both are in same city.. I proposed him last week but he wants to continue as friend only. bcoz he did not like my remark that sex is part of love. He says he has no interest in sex. Both of us have intimacy n respect for each other. That guy is not ready to reveal his name, sector, looks etc Now since he rejected me softly in diplomatic way, But i am unable to stop myself being fallen for him. and he keeps chatting with me whenever possible in day. Now my question is should i continue chatting long hours or frequently whenever he asks for? Or should i stop bcoz when i chat then i again start missing him But he is not emotional like me. He dont chats with anyone also on fb n neither he has any other gay account like on PR or grindr etc. what is in his mind?? what shld i do? i like him very much n he knows it.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, if he hasn't revealed anything to you, how can you say that he is not on the dating applications? You cannot even have trust on such a guy. You don't know what he is doing. He might be living right next to you. Anyway, he made his stand clear then you should stop paying much attention to him. People generally go for those who are out of reach because the grass is always greener on the other side. If you want to continue as friends, then okay. If not, then also okay. Either way stop expecting from him.</h1>
