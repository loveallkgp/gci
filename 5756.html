<p>They didn't say anything. Why would they? They were my friends.. But I felt that I was the odd one. I don't know, if they're still my friends.
 I was the quite one in our class but not so quite in our group. They used to be like me when we were kids. Then differences started to germinate within us. I felt I was still the same and that they changed, little did I know that nothing was constant but change.
 As we were growing older, I was drifting away from them. I had been growing complexes (the biggest one being- poverty), feeling inferior and stupid. I started pretending so as to fit myself and maintain the bonding. It's like chemistry, you gotta loose your electrons to be with some people.
 Things were going fine until they found out about my sexuality. I was bad at explaining things. I never  even tried to explain anyone not even to myself. Neither did they tease me nor did they support. They were mature enough that they chose not to tease but they and I were immature about not supporting me. I chose to stay away and be quite maybe because I didn't want them to feel shameful and so this way I lost the power to communicate.
 I am always looking for friends but then I hold myself back. It's hard when you know the people around you are different and that you won't fit in. But it's much harder when you know that the people around you (whom you love and hate at the same time) are different and that  even if you can't fit in there you have to because you have got reasons.
 Anyway, I know, It's a vague piece of note. But that's how I wanted it to be.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmm... for u i have quotes--</h1>
<p>1- The worst lies are the half truths which are said to thyself.
2- Stay true to you and u will end up being incredibly happy.
3- If u live with the acceptance of others all the time u will die of their rejection each and every fucking time.
4- Don't take someones negative attitude on ur personal self...U r not a garbage can for their shit.
5- Stop looking for happiness in the same place where u lost it.
6- U r the first and last person to change ur life the way U want.
7- Taking self sabotaging steps creates a void and makes u hollow.
8- Do more of what makes u awesome.
9- NOT everyone u lose is a loss.
10- Don't count what u didn't get by praying...see what u got as blessings!</p>
<p>GODBLESS U MY MUFFIN!</p>
