<h1>281 CONFESSOR:</h1>
<p>People PLEASE SUGGEST SOME EFFECTIVE WAY to approach my crush. I get chance to meet him only in the CAMPUS (rarely) and ON THE BUS and that too I ALWAYS FIND HIM WITH HIS FRIENDS AROUND. how should i start a conversation and go ahead when i find his friends around so that they do not get any doubt. ??</p>
<p>I only have two more days ... after that i may not be able to see him as our semester ends. PLEASE SUGGEST INTELLIGENTLY.</p>
<p>I wanted to WRITE HIM A LETTER but unable to decide how to hand my letter to him!! I cant bear his HATRED or MISUNDERSTANDING.</p>
<p>I thought I WOULD MAKE A FAKE FB ID ... but that may leave a WRONG IMPRESSION. and i want to be honest with him. I have no other way.</p>
<p>PLEASE THINK AND SUGGEST. ITS VERY IMPORTANT AND URGENT FRIENDS.</p>
<h1>Viv- Give him some genuine ideas. Personally, i think instead of writing any creepy letter just go and spend these to days with him like a next door buddy. Say that you really miss some good company and he feels like a genuine person. Get to know more about him. But do not creep him out.</h1>
