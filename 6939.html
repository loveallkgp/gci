<p>the most weird things i have ever faced.. not able to come out of this thought!!</p>
<p>last month..</p>
<p>i was surfing grindr.. then i found a man..  aged 36 ..(I'm 20)  he was cool with south Indian alike physics and appearances.. i always have fantasy about little weighty healthy guys like NTR( South Indian hero).. the guy was similar to that actor..
so i approached him.. he said he's versatile.. i said that I'm versatile as well.. he's in teenagers . and i look like teenager.. even I'm healthy and cute.. that i know.. so he liked me and we shared number..
he said lives alone.. so i can go to his room to stay a night...
 i went to his room.. he was much more attractive that those photos.. </p>
<p>at first it went normally.. we had dinner.. drinks.. talks.. and all till late night..</p>
<p>then around 1 am.. we started.. went kisses for 20-30 mins.. but then later he said he doesn't have any gender.. i didnt get at first..
then he said he lost his balls in an accident..
i was so sorry.. but he said.. he's bottom from then.. and he played all the bottom role with me.. from sucking to ridding on it..</p>
<p>then the main weird thing i got from last when i cummed.. 
he said he wants me to poop and pee on his face.. 
i was like wtf?</p>
<p>then he started insisting it..
i said no no no..
but when he became irritated with my NO NO NO!!</p>
<p>he slapped me .. that was too hard .. and he holded my hand and bended it from the backside that i couldn't even moved.. he was very strong..</p>
<p>he then tied my with necktie.. and and he lied under my ass.. and said to me to poop.. i was very comfortable but i had no option.. i did.. he swallowed all the poop.. after that i puked on his body ! and he agaib slapped me and said to clean that thing by peeing on his  body..</p>
<p>and all.. that nigjt was worst nightmare for me.. 
but at the morning.. he said to me sorry for yesterday nights.. he's so frustrated with his life.. sex life so he does this to satisfy him and all..</p>
<p>but i said fuck you madarchod.. and i left his house.. </p>
