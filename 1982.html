<p>its more of a problem</p>
<p>i saw one profile on pr and i messaged him blah blah....after few minutes he replied " did we see each other before". and after looking at his pics closely i realized he is my best frnds room mate.............FUCKK.
actually he shifted in his room recently and me and my best frn doesnt get to meet daily bcz of our uni and work. but i have only  met this person twice of thrice. i am hell worried bcz now i am not interested in him and he might tell all these things to my frn???.....when he replied me on pr at the same time my frn called me asking some lectures notes and assignments...how strange is this?????   i am really worried bcz we will gonna see each other now-n-then..and i have no idea how will i face this????</p>
<h1>GCI : come on .... he is also on PR .... and what on world he might be doing there... definitely not selling breads and biscuits. he has your secret you have his .... or  you can simply block him or make   a new pr .</h1>
<p>or hide your photos from public to hidden . 
seriously u need an advice for this situation ... this was a problem .... what are you ???? a  5 YRS OLD ...</p>
