<p>Hi all ,</p>
<p>I am writing this because I just wanna outlet all I am brimming with. So I work in Tcs Chennai , and there is this guy . I saw him like 6 -7 months back for the first time and since then I cannot lay my eyes off him. I tried to talk to him once , but it was just one sentence .Daily I try to look all around to catch his single glimpse if I am lucky .I tried to outgrow him , to not look for him , to not think about him but I can't . So i have given up trying , i sleep cuddling my pillow thinking i am embracing him and it feels so gooood.Lately I am having so many dreams about him like we somehow meet and finally end up talking eventually. I want to be in his life , to be a part of it but I can't ! Please help me move on.</p>
<h1>GCI- If u r really a mature person then u can understand that what are u actually asking and what are u actually longing.</h1>
<p>Getting attracted, falling in love, having a platonic bond or even having a hookup with the person is fine but its not ok when you are on a superficial level of maturity and ask stupid questions because then u r bringing the notion of maturity at a naught.</p>
<p>P.S- Ask yourself what u really want from that person, will he make a difference in your life, would u be able to live with him, would he be able to think of the way u r thinking for him..If you can answer these questions yourself then you need not ask us anything.</p>
