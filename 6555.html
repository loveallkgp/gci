<p>brkup with my ever best friend I was having some 1sided luv ............after he left.....I was lyk damn!
I have just lost it! He was,is,ll b my life..but after he left I was too frustrated coz said me on 2nd October at berhampur station DAT we never never gonna meet again coz his family gonna shift to shimla.
I was having a good relationship wit him from almost 1 year...no doubt it was sided luv n I was lyk too loyal!
From last 1 year I havent even seen a guy on  dat way ........then I called a bottom guy on 5th August 2 o clock n within 2:45 - 3:00 I have fucked him 2 to tyms lyk I was too frustrated n again I wanted to do but he didn't allowed.....then I called another guy to meet whom I have promised to meet n have no plans to meet.I was going to another guy only bcoz dis was not allowing me to have more sex,other wise I wouldn't have met the third guy.
N trust me guys jab mein uss bande se mila me sex wagera sab bhul gya...he was awesome.
He was having some kind of very +ve energy we didn't had sex he hugged me n made me feel special ...he was such a sweetheart I told him about my best friend (life) n he extolled me.
Dat guy was an angel yar.
Ajj fir milunga usse n whenever I meet him I never feel lyk lost he use to make me feel m not bad.
N hope someday my best friend(life) would come back 2 me chand I Luv u a lot!
Hope u ll b back soon</p>
