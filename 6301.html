<p>Hi, I am 23 gay from pune. I recently got the chance to visit my hometown where I met this 35 year old doctor who is also a medical officer. I must say for a 35 year old he had a good physique. I went to his house to have sex and was mesmerized by the beauty of his garden and the house. He had a golden retriever and a German Shepherd dog. I loved his house. Unlike the other folks he didn't rush to sex but offered me tea and some snacks. He told me stays alone. He left his house after his intermediate and prepared for medical entrance, his entire education was financed by his grandfather as he did not get along with his father and step mother . He did not get married because he knew he would never be happy if he did. He told me that his elder sister and her family often visit him and for the rest of the time he finds happiness in his work, garden and dogs. The entire narration was an eye opener for me as if he can live a happy single life so can us. First we must learn to be happy with ourselves then only can we be happy truly. After that we had sex which was also fun as I had never had it with a guy as old as him. I look forward to meeting him again when I visit my place.</p>
