<p>I used to confess on this page majorly cus of the admin's advise. but off lately I ve seen if a guy is depressed guy confesses here, he becomes all the more depressed by reading the admins taunt-like suggestions. This is to clear that, the page is successful because of its readers and not cus of you or your suggestions. tomorrow even if you stop giving suggestions on every confession it will not make a large difference. we confess here solely to get a solution from the readers here, who are definitely very clever. </p>
<p>(post it, n for heaven sake don't edit it) 
thank you!</p>
<h1>GCI- There, I posted it. And yes, the page is successful because of you people but we are putting in our time in it despite of our super busy fucked up schedule with our personal lives wrecking. Atleast have some respect for that. This is a page where we come up to relate with people. With some of them we do, with some we don't. And then you treat us like robots to do things to the likes of you. One sarcastic thing and everyone just jumps on our bones to suck on them dry.</h1>
<p>And not to mention some stupid confessions we ignore. If you are crying over them, I won't even give you tissues babies. Use your shirts to wipe your tears. </p>
<p>To others who send some meaningful confessions and they were not posted, I am sorry for that because we both take turns to post them and in between some of them get lost due to synchronization errors. Confession list is a damn fucking big thing. </p>
<p>In the end, we are here to help and have some fun. If you don't get the meaning behind a suggestion(even if it is humorous one), its not our fault. Why do people get offended? Because some people don't have the guts to accept the reality. Get above the ego issues and grow the humor bone. </p>
<p>PS- Don't make a chain of "If you have guts, then post it" confessions now. This was the last one that we'd be posting.</p>
