<p>I m a gay, I have no lover, and there is a least hope that I can get any, as I m growing old,, I m now 32 year old, when I was 17 I saw guise on the bikes and got attract, I thought k unme se koi to ek mere liye bhi hoga, par ye bhi problem thi ki kisi se kaha kaise jaaye, apne straight friends k beech straight hi behave karta,</p>
<p>though I made some sex relations but not many, when I came to facebook, I came to find a lover of my age, but I find here u can find sex only,</p>
<p>to maine socha k chalo aise hi sahi, jab sab enjoy kar rahe ha to ma kyon nhi,</p>
<p>than I met a younger guy, we talked a lot for so many days, aur mujhe us se lagaav sa ho gya,</p>
<p>fir hum mile aur ek dusre ko pasand bhi kiya, we had a fantastic sex, best of my life,</p>
<p>but suddenly his behavior changed, I asked again n again, he said I m busy,</p>
<p>when I asked him to meet, he said ok, but u have to pay,</p>
<p>I was shocked, but I agreed, kyonki wo mujhe bahut pasand ha, but his demands are increasing day by day, I dont want to loose him, as I feel he is the last man in my life</p>
<p>what should I do </p>
<h1>Viv- Honey, you were used for sex. These guys always talk emotionally and when they get their fill, they run away or make excuses. If you want to find love, have 2 month no sex dating policy. Trust me, the guy who wants to be with you will stick with you no matter what. And yes, kick that hoe's ass out from your life.</h1>
