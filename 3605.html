<p>Hey guys I'm Prateek heatbreaker here and before I start with my confession I wanna tell you that I'm bisexual n look like a straight guy. I am saying this so that I can get to level of some assholes over here who've been criticising Shushant over his appearance. </p>
<p>I dated a feminine gay in Feb 2013, I didn't knew he was feminine until I met him but you know what, the way he walked and talked never changed my love n care as a best friend towards him because you know what I'm blessed with an amazing mind and sweet heart which isn't bounded by walls created by society. I held his hand all over the way till we were together, I saw group of guys laughing at us about whom I didn't gave a shit and after which he tried to walk away from me but I kept my hands on his shoulder. n yup we guys are still best friend n it's my bad luck that he didn't accepted my proposal back in 2013. :'(</p>
<p>Guys I don't understand that why don't you get it that if you want society to accept gay love then you gotta first accept all types of gay people, even those Cadbury panda toys loving gay people too. 
and yup being a feminine gay doesn't means that a person is a slut or whore. change your mind then only society will change. </p>
<p>N this is the reason why America has accepted gay love n relationship because there people don't see feminine gay with disrespect. everyone is equal there. </p>
<p>Today I wanna ask one question from you that, God made you gay so you want society to accept gay, what if God blessed you with feminine appearance too, then what would have been your perspective about yourself!? would you have disrespected yourself? killed yourself? or wanted people to love you as a normal human and let you be what you're? Ask yourself buddy B-)</p>
<p>BEFORE DEMANDING EQUALITY, FIRST TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY!</p>
