<p>Hi . I am an South Indian and this is my view. I think Gay population is more in North den in South.
North Indian society are more tolerant and supportive to Gays and Hence forth North Indian people are more openly gay than us.I find North Indians gays are more Interactive in many Gay pages than South Indians. It is comparably easy to find a gay partner in North India whereas We need telescope even to search for a gay partner in South :( I appreciate North Indian Gays for there support for LGBT community . Not only gays , even Straight north Indians lend there support :) We South Indians must leave our reserved nature and be strong enough like North Indians. I wish even South Indians come out and support the community Please dont mistake me , I am not here to divide India.. I strongly feel the necessity of South Indian gays to stop being reluctant and Join hands with our Neighbour North Indians in celebrating the life of Gay. :) Then only Equality for love can be brought into force in INDIA. #GAY - Epitome of LOVE :D :)</p>
<h1>Viv- Umm I don't know much about the scenario of south india but over here the condition is not good either. Punjab and haryana are too much conservative, in jammu its a big no no(religious constraints), in UP, bihar and jharkhand not many people are aware about it and in rajasthan many people hold on to old traditions. The condition is bad everywhere. But there are people who are liberal. Its doesn't matter to which part of India they belong.</h1>
