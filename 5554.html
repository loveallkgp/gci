<h1>GCI- Honey, it's not in your hands until you don't know about it, otherwise you would have just considered it not important.</h1>
<p>BTW, if that's what you are doing, it's certainly not friendship at all. You are letting an argument destroy your friendship and you are not making efforts to repair it. Whenever my friend and I fight, we always talk about it and take a solution out of it because in the end our friendship means us way more than those petty fights.</p>
