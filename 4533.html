<p>I hope this love story might interest you. I want someone like this. How's it??? Don't forget to comment..........
It was always difficult for Rex to accept the truth that he might never be able to tell his room mate that he was deeply in love with him. He was desperately trying hard to get his mind rid of his room mate's thoughts. For Days his concern towards Arnold had made him realize that there was something beyond friendship that Rex was hesitating to admit. And then One fine day, Arnold held his hand and began:-
Arnold:- I want to say something.
Rex:- Speak fast , I have to rush to my office (lying).
Arnold:- I could never realize how my life would have been without a person so special who is always there to care for me. I have never felt that it was the same from my side too. The only difference was I could never realize this fact and its high time that I must admit this in front of that person.
Rex hardly took hold of his tears.
Rex:- Then you must rush to that person and confess your feelings. I think its better to do that instead of wasting your time in talking to me. Am much less important than that lucky person.
Arnold:- Ok then, I will do that.
Saying so he moved closer to Rex and kissed his cheeks and then gave him a warm hug. He whispered in his ears, "Am in love with you My love. And am aware of this fact that you love me too. I have clearly seen your care and concern for me. And i think you will be safe in my arms. I love you dearly. Will you accept me??"
Rex was dumbstruck. His mouth fell open. Pearly Tears were shining on his cheeks. "I....I .....mean yes....I can't". Arnold stopped him in between and kissed his lips. He wrapped him in his hands and tightened his embrace. And finally the night came to an end with a sweet celebration of the love that the two were longing for.</p>
