<p>Hello,
How are you all?
My name is Praful and I am from Punjab. Recently I was transferred to Delhi. My office is in G. Noida and my colleagues are of my age group, so it is very easy to work. We party together, play pranks, etc, (you got the idea). I am in a shared accommodation with one of my female colleague. She is very nice, DTE, friendly. Recently, she proposed me out of the blue. I was shocked and was speechless. I am gay but haven't told anyone at work about it. She is beautiful and all, but I am not attracted to her in that way. I asked for some time to think, for now as I do not know what to say. I don't want to hurt her. But the truth is that I can't tell her the truth either because I hang a lot with one other mutual male colleague who happens to be bf. He is way too deep in the closet. And if I tell her the truth then she can easily put 2 and 2 together. I don't want to out my bf. I am out of options. I know, I am in a shitty situation. Can you guys think of anything?
Any advice??? Please help.
Thanks</p>
