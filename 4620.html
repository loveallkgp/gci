<h1>GCI- This happens when people are not given their freedom. Everything behind the doors. Everything is so much entwined. A person doesn't gets his freedom, he is scared to admit it, he takes the wrong decision and then lives his another life in secret. I am not taking the sides but the stupid law makes a lot of victims.</h1>
<p>I really don't know what to say. His truth will come out one day. If you are involved in that, the betrayal will be more. Better stay away from your brother in law.</p>
