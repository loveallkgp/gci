<p>Hey bro pls help me, i dnt know wat to do.     im in good post in airforce,   in love  with my bf, we both loves each other a lot.   yesterday his elder sister read out our all chats  in whatsapp and copied in her mail.  now we both r in a big problem , we cant able to contact eachother.  she says she will complaint to my higher authorities.  i often goes his home n many times stayed there at nights also. Now  my job also in problem , i  cant face anyone, imstraight acting closet gay.   god</p>
<p>We r frm differnt states, i work here in jammu, he is frm jammu. We met thru fb.    im frm kerala</p>
<h1>GCI- I don't know much about the army process, like what do they do if they know if someone is gay. You have to talk with him about all of this and see on what grounds he stands. Try talking with the sister and tell her to mind her own fucking business. You both are adults and it should be the business of anyone to direct your life. Not even his sister.</h1>
