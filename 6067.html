<p>Hi guys
I am in relationship wd guy fr last 4 yrs we love each other a lot.we are emotionally very well attached to each other but sexually he is unsatisfied wd me.But one thing that bothers me is dat my bf is not 100% loyal to me.He has been phyically involved wd his few gay frnds even after we are in relationship.Good thing is that he himself told me abt all this.At initial stages i used to get angry at him so he started hiding these things.Gradually I realised i cant take away his freedom frm him.He is ok if i too hv sex wd somebody else.He always says expecting 100% loyalty in present world is not possible we need to move wd time.But i am not able to do so because of love fr him.I really cant make love to anybody else he is so much into me.
Will things work between us still if things go like this.Is this a practical relationship.</p>
<h1>GCI- This is kind of a complicated situation. If I take my case, monogamity is something that I hold close to my heart, and I expect the same from my would be partner. The line "expecting 100% loyalty in present world is not possible we need to move wd time", is the personal choice. Not something forced by time and the mindset. Maybe your boyfriend is polyamorous. I didn't know much about the practicality of the term until quite recently. I met some polyamorous people, who are gay, and they just cannot do monogamity.</h1>
<p>In the end, if you are not comfortable with the idea, then just move ahead.</p>
