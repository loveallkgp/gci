<p>Hi,
Yesterday on you tube i saw a video made of honey singh actually it was a prank played by one of the vj that he is gay. It was an april fool prank to see public reaction and people are so bloody homophobes  they have such hatred against gays. One of the comment was i will never watch or see his song coz he is gay. I mean its disgusting and humiliating  even in my class, teacher makes homophobic comment  and i give horrible reaction to him after his comment and he knows that and that he started laughing  this is damn disgusting..</p>
<h1>GCI- The next step would be Honey Singh filing a case of defamation against them and asking for them to be sued and to pay a compensation!!! Damn our country is so fucked up and still people say 'MERA BHARAT MAHAN'...Btw homophobes and illiterates don't come with a tag on their head!</h1>
