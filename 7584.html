<p>Once I was at a Chennai's local Railway station ...while I was sitting right there at a platform bench...there came two transgender people towards me ...the person who was sitting near me just got away.. Thinking that they gona ask for smthg frm him... I don't knw why these people get weird about them.. Actually when one Transgender sat next to me ..i leave another one sme space to sit...Even they hv helped me finding the route for a place i was searching for...After a while when the train cmes they moved on.. ... I can still see sm people are starring cse I was sitting with them.. They were nice to us... Ohh..plss...Don't act like this.. behave normal to those people they are just like us..Humans... I don't know wat to say abt this....</p>
<h1>GCI- Good thing you did! We need more people like you!</h1>
