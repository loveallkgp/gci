<p>I want some suggestions from you, people. Especially the couples. Me and my girlfriend, both in their late twenties, have been in a relationship for the past seven years. She loves me to death and so do I. I have a balanced life with time for both work and leisure. Unfortunately, my gf has to work really hard. The only time she gets off her work is on sundays.</p>
<p>We haven't had sex for two years. I tried to stir up the things between us during the first year, but she got really displeased at all my advances. It sometimes led us to fights and even, to her crying and blaming me that I don't understand her.I gave up trying after those episodes.</p>
<p>I understand her and her professional obligations. She gets just one day off, so I do the work around the home so that she can rest without worries. However, I also believe that I am not a sex maniac or anything. I love her so it is natural that I'd feel like making love to her. Sex is not just a physical need for me. It also used to help me bond better with her. The feeling that she wants me and only me for satisfying her sexual needs used to give me more confidence in our relation.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is that why she stopped feeling those things? Did she stop finding me sexually attractive? Are we facing the classic lesbian bed death scene? My worst fear is that she is having doubts about her sexual orientation and staying put with me out of kindness or some sort of moral obligation.</p>
<p>This depravation has taken its toll on my pysche. I feel like one of these days, I would cheat on her and hurt her so bad that I'd not be able to forgive myself.
Please help. Is there any solution and am I the problem? </p>
<h1>GCI- There is an only solution to this that you have to talk with her. You cannot let go of a 7 year old relation like this. Talk with her and see what's bothering her. Maybe she is expecting something else from you and that's not related to sex. After working all day long a person doesn't have any energy left to do anything. Don't take it in a wrong way but plan for something good. Go for a vacation if possible or atleast to some restaurants to an exotic dinner. But first sit her down and just talk like an old married couple. All the best to you both.</h1>
