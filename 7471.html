<p>Hi, I am pretty sure i can not handle a relationship.. and I am sexually active.. so thrs this guy i met( am 28 and he is 40ish), we both had this discussion that we are not interested in relationship at all and this is purely physical.. Now I dont mind being friends and regular non sexual meeting too.. What has happened is that this guy has fallen in love with me . he loves me more than anything i have ever seen.. ready to kill/die for me kind.. He is very genuine , single and sane .. Now because of his extreme love for me which he also doesn't know how and why he wants to meet up regularly and chat ( no un reasonable demands) but since i do not have strong feelings for him some times i get pissed off with the possessiveness and demand for time .. I am unable to handle the situation.. have told him this .. also whn I tell him he goes quiet for Months but gets hurt bad and gets depressed , the guilt of which i am not able to bear .. so what do i do ?? ( PS: thrs no chance of me getting into a full fledged relationship with him or any one)</p>
<h1>GCIL- Talk it out at length and if things happen periodically again then u may have to leave him forever and he needs to accept this fact maturedly.</h1>
