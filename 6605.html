<p>Dear People I would like to confess on the Below
It happened a month back when i was with my office mates on a trip to an amusement Park i tried to get into close with a Guy without knowing whether is he interested or not, As the intention to move towards him was just because of his signs towards him at office and chats..</p>
<p>But he totally neglected my move and i was bit hurt because of that, later i realized my mistake and came away from him, because asking sorry may sometime makes him feel awkward.</p>
<p>Couple of Guys at my office are close to me and we get along with each other ans they don't know about my orientation, while i been talking to them close and playing at smoking area, this guy whom i approached used to watch me and stare at me, i thought it is normal for a guy to see like that and for the past two weeks he gave me a winky smile sometimes and stare at me when i pass him and getting a reason to talk to me and look on me all times and finally three days back he touched my hand wantedly and pressed my shoulders...</p>
<p>What should i do with this action... I was not reacting or looking at him for this</p>
<p>I don't know what to do ? Tell me</p>
<h1>GCI- Well either you like it or you don't like it. If you like it then give him some affirmation, if you don't like it then ask him to control and relieve himself in the washroom.</h1>
