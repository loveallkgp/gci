<p>Replies to people who commented on confession #4887
(My brother who is 25...)
It seems that you don't know that facebook pages are accesible to all people around the world, including my brother. It's because of him I came to know about this page.
NEXT- manny people claimed that I am happy because My father died. Yes&amp;No is my answer. He was conservative, abusive and my mother and father were never on good terms. He was a drunkard as well who preferred spending his time in bar with his friends but not with us. When he went away, we had no good memories of him to cry and desire his company anymore. The reason why I'm happy because he left some money for us to survive and live. That's the only sensible thing he did but that too was first claimed by our devilish cousin's parents.
So why should I feel sad for his absence?</p>
