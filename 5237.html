<p>Hello admin! I really dont know if you are a top or bottom but dont mind my words if I happen to speak ill about you or anyone else! This is a question rather than just a confession: WHY ALL TOPS ARE ONLY AFTER SEX? I am 21 and all I have ever asked for is just a well educated and good looking top who would love me more than anythng else. I know myself and am pretty sure that I aint that bad when it comes to looks as I come from north-eastern state of India and I know that most of the Indians prefer us but I just dont know why but every top I've come across be it central indian or north eastern are hungry wolves when it comes to sex. Am not scared of staying single, am just afraid of ending up alone! So this is a request to all the tops that don't just play with a bottom's heart cause it hurts like hell when we are just used as a sex toy as we know none of you will ever commit to us when it comes to marriage! :-( :-( :-(</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you ask why every so-called top prefers only sex and yet you ask for top for a relationship. Maybe you should try and go for a person as a whole and not for the position that he plays on bed. Try changing your perspective as well because if you pay emphasis on the sex position, that is what you gonna get.</h1>
