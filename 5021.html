<p>Salaam to all,</p>
<p>To my special friend,</p>
<p>Exactly its been a month that I met u in person .....and exactly the same feeling still remains...for when i saw u for the first time and upto being in ur arms and feeling as serene as ever....the date has shifted to 12 th of jan but I still feel that freshness of our first meeting.. U have given new emotions, new maturity, new thinking pattern which I never had before...may be this is why it is said that our life changes when we make a place in it for somebody...I now notice that my vocabulary comes from ur mouth and ur vocab slowly making way into my daily life...I smile everytime I see the mirror just out of no reason... have u ever wondered that u are so charming that u don't need to kill people...ur smile does all the honours...I don't know what to write and how to write that when u keep ur head on my shoulders to sleep I feel so true...so strong...so responsible...so loved...that I don't even bother to move my arm and u sleep soundly on it the whole night whenever we meet and it doesn't feel pained or annoying...I cannot measure the amount of ecstasy when i feel only on seeing u...I don't know how many times I see ur pics in a day and kiss them before going to sleep...
I even don't know that whether I shall be able to do whatever I claim and have thought but I surely know one thing whenever I would see that we are having differences I will try to love more ...I will try to understand more..I will try to accept more....for we can always find a a genuine single reason to hold onto the person who is as flawed as us which must bind us and not separate us.....Do U know that I get afraid by ur anger..I get frustrated when u don't talk while angry which i think u do best...I feel special when u r angry and don't blame me and unlike me u don't slap me when i say something stupid that is hurting...I am sorry for those two slaps but u know why I did that...even when I am nude with u i don't feel like fucking u...I feel to make love with u just by cuddling and making u sleep on my shoulder...I can again go on and on but I will say that I will give u the hope of loving u my entire life and would expect just a hope...no words..no promises...that would be ur promise for me...I seriously cannot see ur angelic eyes in tears..I shall wreck the universe if someone brings them into ur precious and dearly eyes...and if I do that U can punish me by every right of our love...for love is the only amen creating magical achievements....I would always be sorry if I hurt u and make every possible amendments and yes I won't use big words or do great promises...for my strength would be ur love and my actions would be according to ur hope of love for me to hold on which u would give...and my promise would be ur promise...</p>
<p>From ur special friend..</p>
