<p>i have  always been more mature than the others of my age. My parents never took my problems seriously though i always pretended to be happy. I was raped in my childhood by my own uncle. I could never say that to any1. But that's not the only reason for me being gay. I feel i was born with this inside which grew stronger to overpower my personality. No matter how hard i try.....feeling of love doesn't make me happy....i find it rather worthless.........may be coz i have never been in love.........
.
.
being honest......all i want from boys is sex........be it teachers, classmates, relatives, strangers or any1........i can't ignore any good looking guy without having looking him at-least thrice......this is so pervert of me..........but i have no hold on my feelings. Though m a virgin but ones who know about real me never believe that. That doesn't matter to me but what matters is my happiness which i never achieve by any means. Sometimes i feel that my bitter childhood and past has made me this way or may be m a psycho but both ways.............i don't find myself happy enough to embrace my life.</p>
