<p>Bollywood / TV - has started portaying LGBT in better and natural way..
Satyamev Jayate - (Huge reach capacity) - 19th Oct Episode - was simply mind blowing..
Kaisi Yeh Yaariyan (No. # 4 TV Serial) - 7th Nov episode really gave me some goosebumps when She told about supporting equality, natural to be homosexual etc.. It was really bold move to showcase this issue very positively in public TV in MTV..
We need some big startcast movie with good story around this topic..</p>
<p>Now with two Legal matters getting highlighted in public - 1. Aamir Khan 2. Bangalore Techie - should give some positive visibility to the importance of our rights.. and now that Pride have started around the country - I am really hopeful 377 gets abolished ASAP..</p>
<p>To Admin &amp; Educated junta out there - what's your take on any change in - legal front / in 377 / anything else - etc taking place in near term (3-6 months) or longer. ?????</p>

<h1>GCI- It's good that a big change is happening regarding LGBT situation. People are getting to see a whole new picture of queer people rather than the fun element.</h1>
<p>Legally if we see, it is a long procedure as both the sides have to give out valid arguments. The curative petition is under hearing and the next hearing date is somewhere in January.</p>
<p>Politically it is a lost case for us for 10 more year. Considering the present government and their RSS support need I say more?</p>
