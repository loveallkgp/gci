<p>I m 20 frm Pune.I m secretly gay.I m currently studyng in TE mech.I hav brother of age 24.He is doing job in IT industry.He iz good lukng n is very sincere n introvert guy frm childhood.
He always set password to his mobile phone n doesnt give to any one including me.3 days ago I got his mobile n cracked password.n I was shocked.I saw gay sex videos n not a single straight sex video in his mobile.He doesnt knw that I checked his mobile.I m sure he must be gay or bi.It iz weird bt frm that day I m feeling sexual attraction towards him.Wht do u think guys shld I reveal my sexuality to him n also ask abt him?</p>
<h1>GCI- I think you both need to just talk with each other. Just my personal thought- If someone near you is gay, doesn't mean you have to get inside their pants. Otherwise if whatever you do is by consent, then I have nothing to say. It's your decision and I am no one to judge.</h1>
