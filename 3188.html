<p>Hi im 28 and gay. I have passed mariageable age and cant push parents pressure much longer. So im geeting married in 3 months. Guys pls help me with name of some medicine apart from viagra which will help me act straight during honeymoon. Many married gays i talked to said take viagra but i feel dizzy when i take it.I tried sex with girl once but kept losing erection. I am scared of my wife or inlaws suspecting. Pls help</p>
<h1>GCI- You cannot become a slave of viagra. Read about its side effects before taking it. Moreover if you are scared of getting married, then how long will you sustain it? Two years, three years? Maybe you will have kids also. One day you will stop having sex. You will look for sex outside, may even get into a relationship. Your true sexuality will out itself because you cannot just stop it. And after that you will realize what a horrible mistake you and countless others have done. You would spoil your life, your wife's life and your kid's life(if you have any) which will be a complete disaster. Revise again on what you truly want.</h1>
