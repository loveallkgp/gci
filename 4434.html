<p>It was really tough for me to share my feelings in words. But I just cant take it anymore.. May be it goes a bit long..No offence meant to anyone and any part of L.G.B.T.. I know a guy from last 3 months and he is a very gud guy in every meang. Tries to maintain the things shares things, we laugh we quarell etc etc.. But he is a bisexual.. If i just ignore this thing he is the bestest friend as a person. On 22th nyt i stayed at his home and we just have hugging,kissing and cuddling nothing more. It was my 1st time with a guy.. When we r kissing each other i should have became horny and allow him to do more.. But we stopped and i put my head in his cheast nd listeng his heartbeats asking him several questions..He said to me that he can have a relatnshp with me till he gets engaged.. i just said if u have the intention to leave me in nowhere dnt hold my hand.. I told him if we do more then this i cant be a frnd anymore my feelngs wil be more. I asked me so many thngs like aftr ur marriage what wil u do if u want sex frm a guy? There is no future between u and me.. U wil leave nd i wil stand nowhere and many more. He didnt give any answers or explanition i knw he was nt havng a answer i think to bi really has answr. He Just said stop thinking it let time decide just go with the flow. Future is unknown.. In 7 billion of populatn is it so hard to find a true guy rather than lovng sumone with whom i dont have a future???</p>
<h1>GCI- Its better that you started asking those questions which man people don't and then ruin their emotional self at the later stage. You already know the answer to what you want to do, don't you?</h1>
