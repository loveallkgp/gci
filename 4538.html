hello folks!!...
well.!.. i m so confused now about my sexuality!..
i have always wanted to have a gf. i had some complicated relationships in the pass with a couple of girls which were through emotional feelings only and could not have sex as those were not committed ones, and when i was in love with those girls...those particular times i hardly thought of guys. Otherwise, i like guys physically only, not emotionally at all, and i have never fallen for any guy too. i did have gay sex with one of my frens when i was around 16, and i thought i was gay. But recently, when i hooked up with a couple of guys (me as top), i dint enjoy to the fullest apart from smooching and body play, even though i enjoy masturbation while watching hot gay porns....bj,fucking, infact evrything. And yeah!.. i do enjoy watching straight porns also but not much and m quite eager to smooch a girl and even sex.
I mean when i see a guy what i look for.. is his physic(sexual perspective) but when i see a girl.. it's emotional feelings first!..</p>
<p>so, has anyone ever been through such feelings and thoughts.!?!.....</p>
