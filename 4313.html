<p>Hello friends I m Dev . I just wanna thank our admin for posting my confession . All I wanted to say in my confession was that every human being have their own thoughts and emotions .. they stand with their own identity and thoughts and that's why we differ from each other . We all have rights to contradict each other's thoughts . But we have no rights to humiliate , abuse or degrade someone for his different thought . Guys respecting someone's individuality and identity shows where do we stand in our life when we can't respect other's thoughts and emotions we don't deserve the same respect for our ownself even because we are an individual with our own identity like others are . We definitely are not xerox coppies .. right . Guys I love this page because this page is a platform to showcase the real side life of homosexuals .we can share our thoughts on a friendly note and if we go wrong with a friemdly and a sweet not u can contradict . so guys just share ur thoughts and contradict well for ur thoughts with others. But do not humiliate others for their thoughts because for u and the rest humiliating might be fun but for someone else it can shatter him into pieces .... . Thanks yaar admin .... ur comments required ...</p>
<h1>GCI- I'd just say this, whenever you try to make fun of anyone sensitive, just try to put yourself in their shoes and imagine your life with their perspective. And I am not saying this for people joke instead of confessing.</h1>
