<p>I m already open to my parents . I was open to my parents ....  and you know what just happened to me . I saw my dad crying . My dad called me a whore , prostitute , my dad made my mom against me . I was locked into 4 walls . And I was restricted to use mobile for months . I lost all my friends .I lost all my contacts . ....  I m the only child to my parents ... born after 14  years  my dad's marriage ..  I first lived in Kolkata .where I had no friends and after I got  done with my 5th grade ... my dad migrated to  south India . I was the pushed to a boarding School for 2 years and then I came back home ... when I came back to south India . My friends mocked me now and then as I used to efiminate during my younger days .... I did have crushes when I was under going my 7th , 8th &amp; 9th garde .... and all went in vain . No body used to give a damn just because I used to efiminate .... I tolerated my friends as they used to tease me for every time I went to school I cried like a dog . But no body just gave a damn .... then I thought of changing my behaviour .. I thought of showing  a bit of attitude and turning a bit aggressive . But nothing worked .. but yes it  did shut everybody's asses for sure .now m 19 years old studying in my favorite college in Kolkata ....and honestly even today I m not that close to my friends but yup atleast I have no body to laugh at me . As I do have attitude to shut people's asses .... ... and now I don't effeminate also ... thank god I have stopped effiminating ... my college friends never mock at me ...and I m kind of like happy . Now.... </p>
<p>$ABBY : first of all you get to know ' effeminated' nature isn't desease and you should have said anything like that coz my page is having so many effeminate readers and your line on them is really degradatory ..no matter what your personal thinking is ...!! </p>
<p>but as you are happy now its good. i know what it really puts you through being mocked at school by school mates just because of who you are .</p>
<p>and you dad is asshole , and narrow minded , coward person who isn't supporting his only kid. if my kid wanted to wear tiara and tutu and was born male , i would have let him wear it. </p>
