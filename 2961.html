<p>I love my bf but he beats me a lot over small things. Once he almost broke my hand by twisting it for not picking his call. I dont want to leave him since hes very good looking and im average. I wont find anyone like him again. I am scared of lonliness. So i accept his abuse and still love him</p>
<h1>GCI- So you think that making a compromise just over looks and getting beaten down by him is okay. Your choice. Whom am I to say anything. Also, you think that physical abuse is okay and you accept it. Your choice. Moreover, you think that your bf being a psycho is totally fine with you because you don't want to be alone. Your choice buddy. Lastly, you think that being not so handsome makes you somewhat beneath him. Totally your choice.</h1>
