<p>Probably u remember nothing at all what it was like to be 6 or 7 or 8 right?
Well, me too, except for a name - Sonu!
Sonu was a boy next door. 5-6 yrs older than me. My good hang-out buddy. He used to suck me. In bathroom. In his house. In my house. In open parks.
I have no idea when it had started. But I didnt like it. Why would a kid that age like it anyways? If I rejected to go with him, he'd complaint to my mother who'd turn to me and say "Sonu vaiyya bula rahe hain to jao. Bado ki baatein maante hain" (Only if the poor women knew what the fucking 'vaiyya' was doing to her son! -<em>- )
At some point, I came to rebel. I said "NO" to his face. He threatened to tell everything to my mum. I was scared to death. I cried like hell while I sucked him and while he sucked me back.
One day he said "You are very beautiful. I am sorry. But ur mum would've bitten u too. So dont tell!" I said nothing. He was a monsters figure to me. Hell, I was scared of him.
Two days later, I came to know his family left the apartment there. That was the happiest moment of my life.
..
Even at 19 when i m writing this, I am shivering like hell. My hands wont allow me to write something that i have told to no one.
Two more 'Sonu' came in my life who tried to exploit me in the same way when I was 10 and 12 respectively. First one couldn't; second one was a bastard! -</em>-
I guess it was more because of the way I looked that it was all happening to me. So, I stopped talking to people much. My friends circle reduced and I was labelled 'shy' and 'quiet' as I grew up.
In a way, I started shutting people out.
I am one of those really pretty looking guys (well, people say that) who r too straight-looking for anyone to guess might b gay...even gay guys guess i might have 2-3 gfs.
Now whenever I walk out somewhere, and if guys stare at me... and even when some smile...I get scared. I get an impression that I know what they want. All men want is sex!!!
I have made a strong a opinion in my mind, which is not good, i know, but it wont go away. My childhood still haunts me. I cant still get over it....
My main motto of writing this is to tell u people that Child molesting completely DESTROYS a life. DO NOT ever do it outta ur lust and STOP anyone who tries to do it. It's effect on a tender brain is much more than imaginable. Think bout it guys and ACT against it too.</p>
<h1>StopChildAbuse</h1>
<h1>StopSexualExploitation</h1>
<h1>GCI- I am so sorry. These are the stories that people should know and understand that abuse can never make anyone gay. Rather it induces fear in them. Stay strong buddy. Make something good out of your experience. God bless you.</h1>
