<p>Hey admin you are doing a great job and may this year bring so much happiness in your life..... (y) (y)</p>
<p>Its not a confession and I want everyone to understand this specially our silent readers that's y I am not using abbreviations</p>
<p>I just want to know why most of the people are busy in begging for relationships here on Facebook ?
Like they are all alone and they want someone to spend their whole life with and blah blah....</p>
<p>I think love happens once and after that all are substitutes of our first love....</p>
<p>I don't know what is happening with the most of the people here....</p>
<p>May be I am acting like a frustrated bitch but.....nothing to say now</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for reading and happy new year buddies....</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm, bitch u need to learn to get ur ass burned in the right manner.</h1>
<p>Love can happen n number of times but its a life time affair to be precise and needs to be understood objectively as well as subjectively.
FB is the new black in finding the market of love and relationships...Trends keep changing dude bcoz of society and technology.
No one is a substitute for anyone bcoz no one deserves that. And if u substitute people  and treat them as options then remember U R ONE AMONG THEM TOO for someone.</p>
<p>P,S- What did u think before u wrote this fucked up draft?!</p>
