<p>I am 19year old. I am a girly gay.Everyone makes fun of my effeminite behavior. Even in gay community I don't feel safe.I am afraid  to go to school because everyone mocks at my appearance. They imitate my walk and talk infront of me.I feel very hurt.Everday I come home and start to cry..My brother don't want to go out with me.I was in love with a mascular top.I didn't see that he put girlish stay away in his profile.When I dated him.He hits on my face...chakks sala, he said.Even in my didi's wedding barati stripped me for fun .My JIJA's brother introduced me to his friend telling this is my brother's sala.... Adha admi adha aurat.A teacher said, my parents should be in jail for producing defected maal...and my father calls me handicapped child .That's why I shattered myself completely in a room. I feel afraid to go outside .I am addicted to pornography, that's why..</p>
<p>$ ABBY : darling let me tell you are fabulous .. very fabulous and never let anybody tell you that you are wrong . now bring some changes . be fierce , be strong .  when you go to school don't talk to anybody ever ever ever . ( cut off with people , they already treat you like shit so show them you don't need them ) go to school , learn education , in free time read books or listen to songs if you school allows mobiles . when somebody mocks or makes indecent comments just ignore . don't give looks , don't bother to even see who said that just walk on . 
cut off with all other straight guys too... your brother too if they feel ashamed of walking with you ... well they aren't supportive and are just as important as shit . if your father thinks that way .... never talk to him except only when there is need ( money ) .  create your on world. have some gay effeminated friends on internet and maybe meet them too . 
see once you are outta school , choose agood career for yourself. only way too slap all these people on face is to " be successfull '' . and if somebody tries to come near you to become friend ( from these people ) don't be friends ..... reject them . break hurts honey ......</p>
