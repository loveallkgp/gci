<p>Hii.. I found a boy in my area in this Fb. V had a formal chat n wen it was time for photo sharing, he refused n asked for a meet. So I said let's have a casual meet in public. V shared our numbers. We met in public place n he said let's go n talk in my house balcony. I said no, but he said v can't chat here in public. So I said k n went there. Wen v went, he didn't even spoke, but he started to press my tool n started kissing. I said him clearly before in d chat itself, that its a casual meet n I don't want any smooches, let's talk first. But he broke the rules n approached me. Wen he did so, my temper raised n I kept quite. Then he took his tool out n said to suck it. I said its too much for today, vll have it some other day. U have already broken ur surity. Inspire of that also he forced me to suck. So r d other way, he wanted me to suck him. But finally I said all bakwas reason n came home. He is txtng now to meet today noon for x. What shld I do now. Shld I start d relationship wit d one who is not giving importance to.my words ??</p>
<h1>GCI- Ahhh honey, it will just be a hook up and not a relationship. He just want a dry hump and nothing else. If I were in your place I would have blocked him right away. BTW, if you do want some casual fun, you can go. Its totally upon you. But if you have a bit of dignity, you'd stay in your home and leave that guy be.</h1>
