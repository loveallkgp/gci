<p>Hey guys Samuel Ryan here, well i just wanted to say how happy I am feeling in this past two months, well I am northeastern but staying in delhi from last two months for jop training and here I met 63 different people for the first time and they now mean a lot to me n my life, like a family now we share, we talk, we play, n yes their just wonderful.. Well now we came so close n one day we decided to tell all our stories honestly, everyone, I was kinda scared when my time came but I had to do it so I stand and told everyone that 'I don't have girlfriend' and they were like 'WHAT..? Why..? coz ur good looking' so I said with all my courage 'I AM GAY' and you know guys they did said anything n I thought oh they hate me n when I turn around one of oue senior came to me and hugged me and said 'Brother you are UNIQUE' n that time I was like wow I am loved and yes ofcoz some didn't liked me being gay but they support me coz they they liked me not for what I am but for who I am..</p>
<p>Again last weekend our softskill teacher was teaching us about KISS 'keep it short and sweet' And he asked all the student about if we like kissing n the time came for me to reply so I said no which shocked him and made him questioned me 'WHY..? Hey are you straight' Again I said No which lead him to another shock n asked me 'Are you gay or bisexual' so with all my voice out loud I said 'YES I AM GAY' And god I was so blessed hearing him say 'BOY YOU ARE THe FIRST GUY I EVER MET IN MY LIFE WHO SAID THAT OUT LOUD... I AM PROUD OF YOU' And now I love my teachers and my friends so much...</p>
<p>Thank you all for your love &lt;3</p>
<p>guys I just wanna say now is be yourself and people will like you n yes they do like us now so be proud</p>
<p>GAY AND PROUD WOWOWowowowo
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>
