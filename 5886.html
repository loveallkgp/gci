<p>Me and my bf are perfectly compatible with each other, except in bed.
According to him, my dick is long but not thick enough for him to have it deep throat or enjoyable anal.
Moreover, his desire for sex is not enough for me, he likes to have sex once in a month or so.. and I want it several times a week.
We discussed on this to which he said that it's fine we can occasionally catch some third person for sex whenever we feel like, for love is not based on sex. But I kinda disagree to it, what do you guys suggest?</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmm..see honeydew its ok for u and ur bf to have ur stands regarding sex life...POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED-</h1>
<p>1- U have a high libido..ur bf hasnt...ITS OK for both of u, no big deal!
2- U have been told that u both can catch the THIRD person for sex....is it like NSA sex??..if it is..then there is no harm in it..but sexual feelings must not develop into love(most people think it does)....It can lead to loving a person sexually....clear this out..BOTH OF U!
3- Its ok that ur sex drive is higher as compared to ur bf..but remember its NOT SEX that binds the relation but ITS MORE THAN SEX that brings two people together...Sex is a flavour of love not the complete base picture of love...
4- It is nice that ur bf is understanding and he understands that love is not based on sex ...but u must also understand that u both apprehend the notions of polygamy and monogamy...ur relation is monogamous but occasionally polygamous...THINK ON THIS ASPECT MORE..
5- Biological aspect of assortative mating is ur case(somewhat) and u want ur bf to act accordingly which is not that possible..bcoz every individual has different sex drives etc...which creates complications.
6- U must understand the aspects of polygamy, demisexuality and pregmatic love ..bcoz ur case is quite simple yet somewt complicated..
7- If u both can live the way u both want..then decide accordingly bcoz sex drives lessen with age....BUT TRUE LOVE DOESN'T.</p>
