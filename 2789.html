<p>Hello admin and all you beautiful people here,
I am quite old to have all that teenage crushes but don't know why I am getting this lately now. I am in my late 20s and still kind of hooked onto celebrity crushes. 
I am an introvert person who likes to keep most of the stuff to myself unless it is utterly necessary to share it with someone. 
I never experienced any celebrity crushes when I was a teenager. Sometime I wonder maybe because I don't have anyone special in my life , that might be causing it to fill the void. It is complex feeling and hard to explain. I am already seeing a psychologist but it's not much of a help. So if any of you guys have gone through this and could suggest something please do. It consumes much of time thinking about all this. 
Thanks. Love Y'all.
Ciao</p>
<h1>GCI : see there is no age to have celebrity crushes , you can have celebrity crush even when you are 50 nor 70 or 90 . in your late 20 means you are still below 30 .. which mean you are young at the peak of your youth .</h1>
<p>why are you wasting money and time on a psychologist . being an introvert does not mean that you never talk to anybody . its just you are selective and choose very less people to connect with .</p>
<p>life isn't just about getting a lover .. there are more things to it ... if you find it hard to make personal approach , try making a professional approach to people . a healthy socializing with no gain no loss but will be very soothing to fill void. moreover try finding people and date some too .. of your taste .</p>
