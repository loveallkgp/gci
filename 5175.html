<p>I have a whole lot of friends but most are way too busy with their lives now.Everyone has a partner and that's what takes up most of their time .
I keep myself busy with work .But at times one feels really sad and cranky.I don't feel like coming out because judging by Facebook friends,my city Kolkata hardly has any decent guy who is gay ,someone with whom I would strike up a conversation if I found him on the street,so to say.
Admin and friends,what should he my way out ? Waiting till I can leave this country and live the way I want to ? Or just sleeping with random people just to keep this depression and loneliness at bay ?</p>
<p>Btw I am 20 and a virgin.Its been difficult but work has kept me busy.But right now I feel cranky like hell</p>
<h1>GCI- I don't think that random sex can keep the depression and loneliness at bay. That's just temporary. When the guy leaves, you really have no contact after. Just don't give up hope on finding someone. If there a 8 people out of 10 that can't be with you, there will still be 2 out there.</h1>
