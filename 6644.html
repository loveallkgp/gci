<p>I saw a gay pride last month. It's sad you people have to do this for gay rights. I am a gay rights supporter but must think of risks too. We can't allow you to openly mix as our culture and kids will get affected. Straight men also will be fearful in buses trains etc that a gay will touch his body. I think best solution is for government to build special schools for gays and colleges where they teach gay courses like designer, makeup, barber's, massage etc and give them jobs in fashion industry. That way they can live with dignity and not mix with regular society.</p>
<h1>GCI- WE DON'T NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO BE MAINSTREAM....WE CAN DO THAT ON OUR OWN WITH OR WITHOUT STRAIGHT ALLY SUPPORT.</h1>
<p>WE ARE FABULOUS AND SHITTY JUST AS U ARE AND WE DON'T NEED YOUR PITY OR ADVICE ON THIS.
WHY R STRAIGHTS LIKE U SO STEREOTYPED PEA BRAINS?!</p>
<p>To counter your so called 'dreaded' points I will say-</p>
<p>1- You don't know our 'culture' totally so don't trumpet on this word and kids get affected by anything good or bad, this is where the role of guardians or parents are required.
2- Pervert men are already fearful because the way many perverts touch women they will now feel the victim the same way. Dare u tag them Straight..
3- What the fuck is a gay course?! R U NUTS? Or just learning a new kind of chutzpah these days?! The world is moving into a new realm of having a movie on RU PAUL'S DRAG QUEEN MOVIE and u r stuck with the same old rant. Gawwwwwdddd I need a headache pill.
4- LGBTQA comes from the mainstream, regular society and we need to be understood as 'different' NOT segregated and shunned 'alien'.
PERIOD!</p>
