<p>how r u doing admin :)
i just felt to sharing this to your page after reading several confessions. though i have shared a thought to this page before and it gives really a good feeling after seeing responses , that's why i sharing again!</p>
<p>i have heard people saying gay/bi people are only for sex, they don't have feelings, they are rough and many things but according to my situation and other facts i will say G/B people are most of sensible and weak from inside in terms of love and feelings than straight guys!
GB people easily get broken and they are often used to it either with same sexuality or with straight but still GB people can manage themselves and can pretend happy even if they are broken inside.
about me,
i had 6 gfs till date but never had any bf . i am handsome i can say bcoz of my friends circle and collegeious. unfortunately i felt for a guy ki i love him like anything.. never had those feelings for anyone that i have for him. though he was just my friend and now stranger i expect nothing from him but i love him like anything.
it has been almost 6months that we bcame strangers and i have became asexual. i have lost all sex wala feelings, i don't get attracted to females or males. but i just wish we could get together again. :) thanks admin for you and your awesome page.</p>
<h1>GCI- I'm good, thanks. Hope you are doing well too. But judging by your comparison you are not. The key to the solution of your situation is that you should get into the market so that someone could trigger the butterflies in your tummy to flutter the feelings inside you. Cribbing about it from the inside will make you depress slowly. Try getting out of it. Leave the past because you cannot change it, future is what you cannot predict but the present is something you can construct.</h1>
