<p>hello admin......I am a young guy who aims high in life ..but but but i dont know ...did i made any mistake by realizing  about me at early age? all sort of aberrations from my normal path always results in sorrows and a decline in my confidence .i get involved in these stuff so much that family, friends and most important career becomes secondary. I am fed up!! i dont know why i am having a urge of having some one stable and understanding guy beside me . i dont know where my strength of living alone has gone?  i just want someone career oriented and inspiring guy beside me to galvanize me at every moment and vice versa ..... and the more saddening fact is when you dont want to indulge in physical unless you are in soul love with some guy , unless you see him as one of the most crucial person of the life , but when you approach people they are like within few months they want to share the bed and if you deny then you are the most bring person on this planet. Or may also get a tag of impotent . i am socially very inactive i dont use any apps or dating sites , so may be i havent yet found any good platform to search good caring friends ( whose priority is not sex ).</p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmmm..Sorry bro my words may deem harsh...so please beware and bear with us!</h1>
<p>1- What exactly do you mean by Lost ur strength? Was it on a validity period or something...ans me this first!!</p>
<p>2- Your sorrows are a part of your life. Stop trying to get rid of them and trying to achieve the so-called-ideal-happiness. OUR soul is innately happy and whatever we feel apart from it makes us human and nothing else. In short stop stressing on it unnecessarily.</p>
<p>3- STOP sex shaming and DOUBLY STOP Love glorification.</p>
<p>4- Both these entities have the power to change and shape us. Treat them neutrally and delete this notion of being preachy to urself.</p>
<p>5-  Sex is an emotion, a psychological state and our physical response to our brain manifesting through sexual organs. Plus it is our biological proof of us being alive. 
For heavens sake understand the fact that it needs to be dealt with good discipline but always be attended to at the same tym.</p>
<p>6- Love is a big word. It needs our entire life to describe it and live 'in it'. So please refrain using this word and IS WORD KO GHISANA BAND KAR DO....</p>
<p>P.S- Aim high...do every possible shit that makes u the best version of urself and be fabulously flawsome.
U r not here to impress any other soul. The moment u were born it was done already.
Friendships these  days come in all shapes and sizes- With sex and without sex. ABSTAIN from being HOLIER THAN THOU. That ain't gonna help or work. Gluck!</p>
