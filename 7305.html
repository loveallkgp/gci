<p>Hi admin, I am 24 confused if I am a transexual or effeminate gay. I read a lot about both online but not able to decide. It seems trans hate their penis and body hair but I don't. I like masturbating with my penis. But in my fantasies I am always a girl and my husband is doing me. I don't imagine it like 2 guys doing it. Though I don't have urge to dress up like girl in real life but I don't mind wearing it. I don't like sports and drive very badly crashing bike many times. I am also caring kind and don't get angry much. which are all almost girl qualities. My one friend says I must go for  sex change if I am confused. He said trans post ops have a better chance at life and can marry etc. I spoke to a NGO and they said I do not exhibit strong trans feelings which could also be bcoz i have subconsciously suppressed them. They asked me to wait till I am really sure. But if I get older then who will marry me. Sex change will be waste. Is it OK if I start sex change process in Thailand?</p>
<h1>GCI- OK lemme get things strt here...</h1>
<p>1- U must love ur body under all circumstances with or without surgery.</p>
<p>2- U are effeminate and gay....do u want more labels??? Or are u satisfied with ur lot?? Clarify this first.</p>
<p>3- No one can suppress their inner soul and reality for a very long time. And u my dear are just a guy who is a soft one with no macho behaviour....its that simple.</p>
<p>4- Surgeries are required/needed when u r not happy with ur body or want a definite identification of gender and sex.....but I am seeing that are just in a state of confusion and are acting a bit irrational.</p>
<p>5- LGBT doesn't mean u will have to fit in the rainbow with labels and tags...U r a part of it in ur own unique way...do not run after identities and tags..they are not worthy.</p>
<p>6- U need to be with a person who can understand ur persona and vice versa and then much of ur confusion will shoo away.</p>
<p>7- Start practising the kind of persona u want to carry, u will feel better.</p>
