<p>I so badly wish I was born in Sodom and Gomorrah. :/
I mean,see, if I was about to be a gay whatsoever then why not in that era where I could have actually enjoyed myself alot along with other people, all of whom thought the way I did in most manner, (Lets exclude Lot, of course :v ) I'm ready to be bombarded by stones n fire in the end...everyone has to die, anyways ! I could deal with other stuff of those cities..but
Seriously, I should have been born in those cities. :( I'm just tired of fake people here and tired of having to pretend 'straight' !!! People here are no less than them...just the thing is now people do everything and then just conceal themselves under the covers of saints. At least people then didn't use to fake themselves. :/
God, why didnt u threw me amongst those 'sinners' o.O</p>
<p>P.S. Admins, are you two together? You're doing awesome jobs, anyways..We All Love You, our faceless, humorously intelligent beasts :* ;)</p>
<h1>GCI- Not at all we are not together. We are just a team. And about those cities....yeah I have no idea about that. But hypocrites lived then also but its just that their numbers have risen over the ages. We don't want some people to force their thinking upon us but we definitely want others to follow what we want. How are we any different from former ones then if we follow their ideology? I am disappointed in the human race altogether.</h1>
