<p>So before breaking up, I said a lot of really mean stuff to my ex, and now that I realize that he was too stressed out with making life better for himself, I sort of feel it was my mistake for not cooperating at all.
Though he has been wrong at his part a lot many times too, I can't type the whole story down, we have done our share of bad stuff.
It's just that before breaking up with him, I said things which I must not have meant too, you know how a person reacts when he's angry right?</p>
<p>So now that I realize this, I sort of want to get back,
We had to watch this movie together and I want to text him a dialogue from it, but the thing is, I don't know how it would sound and what it would end up to.
I am willing to see what happens if I try, but at times I'm blinded by my own perspective
How do you suggest I should act?</p>
<h1>Viv- Here's an idea. Why don't you just say what your heart wants? Copying a dialogue from the movie ain't gonna do anything. Keep it original. Also, if possible apologize him for the abuses you made on him on his face. That should do the trick.</h1>
