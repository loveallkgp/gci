PLEASE your every rude answer will hurt me more so please don't answer like that........</p>
<h1>GCI- Sometimes people just need to take some time alone, masturbate 3 times and sleep the night off. What you consider as a problem, I don't consider it one at all. If you focus more time in shaping your personality rather than mending your behavior, life will be good for you.</h1>
<p>And I'm just saying, a gay friend of mine over here dated a girl in his high school but now he is living with his boyfriend.</p>
