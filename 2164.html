<p>Hello everyone,I just want to confess one thing in my life. when I was 18 years, I used to make my cousin brother(12 or 13 years old), suck my Dick, I used to suck his too. He came from our village to continue his studies at our town. We indulged in such thing occasionally and I think he enjoyed it. But he has gone back to his village, and has grown up. whenever I meet him now, I have a hesitation talking with him and being free with him when in a family gathering. The reason I did that to him was because I myself was abused by my seniors when I was a kid in a hostel. So, everything seemed normal to me as I was at the verge of my teenagehood. But now when I look back at those days, I feel it a bit awkward and I cannot talk face to face with my cousin. what should I do to wipe off this feeling of guilt, and bring back everything to normal?</p>
<h1>GCI : come on as i have said its not gay thing .. its experimental phase of life where young guys do these experimental things out of curiosity . see you weren't adult and you didn't force him to do ... so you can't be blamed .</h1>
<p>it is crime only when an adult sexually  exploit a minor without his permission or consent . </p>
<p>now if you still feel guilty you can talk to him about childhood and say sorry to him . but i don't think he even cares about it .... he is grown up now and has moved on from past . .. if he doesn't care why should you ... its just you are still holding it .</p>
