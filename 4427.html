so pls tl me y odrs think abt me lyk this?
is my behaviour wrong?
hw shud i correct myself.
?
pls tl me ......
i m clueless</p>
<h1>GCI- I guess you should stop looking for a brotherly image in every person. I am sorry for your loss but it is something you should not project it on others. No one can make you the part of their life so early that they can let you enter their comfort field. Atlast, do not really expect anything from the new people you get over here. The one that you want will come when the time is right. Sometimes let destiny do it's task.</h1>
