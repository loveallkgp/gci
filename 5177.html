<p>Hi.. Admin... I don't know why I am writing this... I want to share my story and need a suggestion or comment on it...
I'm a guy who is living in silicon city.. My self gay. I have a frnd named 'A' ( want to disclose his name).. I know him since 4 years.. So caring, loving, fantastic amazing person ... We are classmates.. Sitting together .. Ours is so gud and pure friendship. In our class all were aware of our friendship.. Our friendship is been growing like a huge tree day by day.. Still our friendship is pure gold.. I like him much alot... I had crush on him.. He also used to sleep on my lap... He used to wait out side the campus till I reach to the college... We were like a single soul in the college... He used to bite on ma hand if I did any fun or any mistake.. I was not at all giving attention to that as we are too close.. Daily we used to text until 11-30.. He used to cum to my home and I used to go to his house...in our family all knows that we are best friends.. Our relationship is like a lovers.. Now college is over he is working and me doing my PG. I do love him a lot..Still I treat him as ma boy friend... He him self is too close he also used to be with me how a couples used to be.. He has helped me a lot.. And still he does.. He used to say me I love you n still now some times says the same.. I dont know weather he is a gay or not.. But many times I said with him that I ll stay with you and I won't let you marry and all... Fir this he use to give a small smile thats it.. He wont say anything...
Now a days we use to meet rarely.. Because he us working and I am studying ; for this reason we won't get a time to meet...
But he use to call me ; use to massage me. But the thing is he didnt even said once that he want to stay with me, or he didnt give any positive relationship responses.. I aways use to think of him.. And I seriously need him.. I wanna lead life with him... Today he came to my home.. He took me to the mart on his bike... We came back to home.. After few minutes he slept on my lap.. It made to recall me all collegedays .. In my home all sow that he is sleeping on my lap.;at this time I felt so proud of being gay... He was casual.. He wont even sleep on any others lap.. He only use to be close with me .. For me he broken his friendship with one guy when we were in college...
But stil today I said I love him.. I kissed on his forehead and said see sleeping like an innocent; at tis movement also he has smiled that's it nothing else..
Here I am not understanding that weather he is gay or not!! If he is then why cant he openly say that with me.? . Why can't he say about his feelings?
But before leaving ma home he just kissed on my lips and Said take care..
Hey my sweet heart 'A' if you are here in this id you will surely come to know please dear say that you wanna be with me for ever and ever ....
Dear admin lease give me a suggestion .. Tell me what exactly is he doing?? Why does he is not disclosing anything.. ?? Whats there behind his smile??</p>
<p>Please post this.. And send me post number so that I can clearly get ma post...
Thank you..</p>
<p>Love you 'A'</p>
