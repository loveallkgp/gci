<p>I am 19 year old.I have a lot of acquaintances in real life,quite a few friends but they are all busy with their lives.I have holidays now.I do go out once in a while and have things to keep me busy. But whenever they find me at home my parents keep pestering me that I am incapable of making friends and keep shouting at me. Oh btw I suffer from depression and despite being an avid debater,an accomplished hip hop dancer and a student who is way above average ,I still have moments when I dont have work and without any work to do I feel horribly low and empty.Added to that are my parents who scrutinize every mistake I make and downplay all my achievements .This along with my emptiness resulting from sexuality kills me deep down. Can you suggest what should I do?..You might say consult a therapist but my family is very regressive.They think only "mad" retards visit the shrink.</p>
<h1>GCI- The best way to kill your depression, according to me would be to join the community service. When ever you are free, go to any NGO or something and do any volunteer work. Become independent and don't may much attention to the negative stuff your family throws your way. Your achievements make you a better person, not the criticism.</h1>
