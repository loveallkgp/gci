<p>23 Bangalore
So I met this guy from planetromeo after chatting for more than 3 months. He was 6ft tall and Handsome gym toned gay.He told me that he was from Delhi. He was in some good IT firm as a software engineer. We share no. and I search his name through true caller and got his real name. And I also got his real fb ID but I didn't sent him request. He look super awesome on his fb pics. We share pics through Pr before. But he has better pics collection on his FB account. So we met one fine afternoon. When he hug me and kiss me, it was a dream sex. Super hot guy holding and kissing me, even lifting me up. It was all good then. Time for me to give him bj. I was waiting for that moment. He didn't smell bad maybe he shower before we meet. His pupic area was shaved perhaps a months ago. As all the pupic hairs we're less than an inch long. While giving blowjob I noticed that his pupic hair looks like kind of blonde type. So I examined closer, then I realised that it was lice egg that was giving the shiny blonde look. One stand of pupic hair less than inch long has a minimum of 4 lice egg. Eww it was such a eww moment. I didn't tell him cos he ll feel embarrassed.so I stop the bj. He fucked me and sex session closed.I ask him to leave fast by giving excuse that my roomate will come back very soon. He left , after that my bedsheets pillow covers everything and me in hot water. Luckily I am smooth with very less body hair so lice cannot live in my body. Just sharing my experience .</p>
