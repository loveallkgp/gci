<p>I have a problem ..  and the problem is ..  I get sexually attracted to  ugly looking guy and I keep expecting to fall emotionally for good looking hunks . I have got many proposals for sex dates from good looking hunks  . But I rejected them because they were just for one night  stand  ... nobody asked or cared about relationship .. and many ugly looking guys approached me for relationship .but I just wanted lust from them .. I don't know why I don't get sexually attracted towards good looking hunks instead I feel like falling in love with them and where far ugly looking men are concern I m 24x7 ready to sleep with them but never slept with them once .. I look cute and sexy  though</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, a question for you. What makes you call anyone ugly? And what makes you think that you are cute and sexy? Honey, if you have an ugly heart, you are ugly no matter how white a skin you have.</h1>
