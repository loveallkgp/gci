<p>Hey Confessors,</p>
<p>I am devastated after hearing a break up of one of my friends which is after 9 years of relationship. Don't even ask how my friend is going through. :(</p>
<p>On the other side, some of my friends are really going strong in their relationships abroad. I think acceptance is the key factor coz most of them are from where gay is legalized or better in terms of our country.</p>
<p>Relationships in India are not working because of the society around, they really fuck your emotions.</p>
<p>PS: No matter how i said my life was fucked up in my previous confession, i will have to be strong for my friend.</p>

<h1>Viv- At one time or the other you do get ready to not give a fuck about the society. Whatever you do, society will have something to derogatory to say. Its not only with gays but with straights as well. So, don't give a damn about it because at the end we make the society as well. To expect something we also have to change.</h1>
