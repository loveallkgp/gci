<p>Hey Everyone!! Admin please post this. Please.... :-)
So I knew a guy for a long time. We met here in fb and after few days of awkwardness we became gud frnds. He used to take care of me and I liked it. Slowly he developed feelings for me and I did too. He proposed and I accepted. Its been 6 months now. But we never met. We called each other, did video chatting etc but never met in person because we both are from different cities and had a tight schedule. Now finally we planned to meet. We will meet and spend some days together. Now my question.
What if one thing lead to other and we end up having sex? Will it be ok? We never talked about sex when we planned to meet but what if it is about to happen? Should I go for it? I am asking not because I doubt him. But once I heard about 5 months rule from admin. So admin 5 months starts after we start our relationship or after we meet for the first time??</p>
<p>P.S.- I love him a lot and I know he loves me too. :-)</p>
<h1>GCI- I just said that in general. That you have to decide for yourself that if you are ready to be intimate with your partner or not. If you do want to take it to the next level then sure, go for it but it should mean something other than just a fuck and it should make the bond stronger. It shouldn't be like you loose the spark and interest after it. You got me?</h1>
