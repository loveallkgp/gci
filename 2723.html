<p>I really don't understand how so called top guys like the male gender (guys). I mean doesn't the female gender provide the need that a top guy wants, infact in a more better way. And I don't think its more of an emotional relationship Coz there are many so called top guys who just want to get physical and then bid adieu afterwards. If it is cuteness, then there are many girls who are much cuter. how are top guys attracted to guys (male gender), can you please tell? am very much confused.</p>
<h1>GCI : there are heterosexual top ( who will only have sex with women and women will be their bottom.. actually in hetero sexuality top and bottom are not the terms  which are used to describe sexual position but just for your info i am interpreting it like this)</h1>
<p>then bisexual tops ( they can go either with women or men )</p>
<p>then gay tops or versatile tops ( who will only have it with men )</p>
<p>top is sexual position , sexuality is different thing and you are really combining these too., and your question is wrong .</p>
<p>and other thing can you ask the same thing on bottom's perspective to yourself then you will get answer . ?? like can't a bottom have sex with women ..ofcourse their are many muscular women too... if its all about muscles .</p>
