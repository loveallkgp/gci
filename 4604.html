<p>I think my confession is little bit unrelated to this confession zone. Anyway i am still happy that there is someone who can hear me what i could not able to scream. This is natually as i have only single testicle which i came to know when i am in 6th standard. At first i thought every individual have same structure as i am but it is wrong imagination. I came to know exactly when i start watching porn and my first experience (as u know) that everyone has 2 testicle. Sometimes this makes me depressed and even thought that 'am i abnormat'!! So have somebody heard about this situation i mean having single testicle..?? Suggest me something what i could do!!! </p>
<h1>GCI- It is rare but not unheard of. And you can't grow another testicle! But one think is for sure that it doesn't make you weak or anything.</h1>
