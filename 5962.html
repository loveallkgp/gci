<p>I have a straight friend from pune. I met him just 6 months ago in college fest.
we started chatting, calling each other. He had a gf with whom he broke up just 2 months ago. After that he was totally depressed &amp; under confident. 
but now a days, he calls me daily, and we talk like 1-2 hours in night. He sings songs for me, shares jokes. Talks about family etc.
but today,
he called me 4 times that too in day. He said, thank god that i have u. He sung a some romantic songs &amp; later said "will u allow me to kiss u?" i just cut that call &amp; added it too reject list. Blocked him on whatsapp.
i dnt knw what i did &amp; why. 
but thing is, he can get any good girl bcoz he is handsm &amp; pure hearted then why me? I dnt knw whats going on his mind.
and now he messaging me on fb that i m sorry, just meet me once 
i m thinking to block him on fb too. I dnt want to hurt him. Bcoz i never thought that guy like him will do this to me &amp; actually I like a guy from kolhapur.
Is that right to keep him away ? Was that right ?</p>
<h1>GCI- He seems like to be a bi curious depressed guy after his brkup who needs a nice and decent fuckbuddy...and guess what</h1>
<p>He hit the bulls eye!!!!
Blocking someone is totally dependent on what bond u share or shared!
U like someone else is ok..what do u want to do????Have both the laddoos or what! Just don't commit the mistake of loving someone fakingly..that would suffice!</p>
