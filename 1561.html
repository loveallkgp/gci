<p>i sometimes think of marrying my bf, he has agreed but law doesn't allow us, so we have decided to wait, he is christian so we will have westernized wedding, i never wanted to have Hindu traditional styled wedding. you may know what is westernized wedding, in which a man is in suit and wait for his woman who is in white wedding gown and she walks with her father on aisle who drops her to that man whom she is about to marry. in gay westernized wedding, we both will walk together on aisle and we will come together on stage, after priest chants and both men exchange rings, they kiss each other tightly for few seconds (it happens in heterosexual weddings too). we both will be in our suits and it will take place in church. i just get excited whenever i think about it.</p>
<p>$Abby : yeah i have seen ' sex and the city 2 ' where in the starting there is gay marriage . and its a lovely decesion and i think its totally on to person how he wants to get married . even i like christian weddings ...as they are just quick and there isn't that much of crowd . blessings from the side of our page members and us.</p>
