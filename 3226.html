<p>I am a 31 year old gay male. I decided not to marry but seem to have fallen between two stools bcoz of this. All over 30 gays are married and they just want "fun" not friendship or relation. And below 30 everyone ignores me saying not interested in uncles. The straight guys my age hang out with wives or other families. I tried several dating sites and gay parties but not able to click with anyone at all. Feel like an outcast in both gay and straight world.</p>
<h1>GCI- Atleast feel better that you are not the part of those married gay people who are continuously cheating on their wives by having outside flings. You have the guts to stick to the truth. And love can happen at any age. There is no hard and fast rule regarding the age that you'd fall in love with. Whatever you need in your relationship, just write it down in your dating profile. I am sure the person whose thinking would match, would indeed reply.</h1>
