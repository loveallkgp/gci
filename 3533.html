<p>hii.. I am aryan from jaipur , persuing my grades . I met one guy from pr on last April.
he is frm ahemdabad.</p>
<p>now confession is like I love him alot.. and he too knws it. Sometimes he says he has feelings for me too but their are no chance for both of us to live together so says that pls uh stay away from me.</p>
<p>now the problem is like he is waiting for his visa.. as he is going canada for his career. v had never met assuming that if we will meet than it will be much hard for both of us to forget the moments spend ..</p>
<p>but then too before few days I went ahemdabad to meet him. v both spended good time and I cried alot . he said like yar its nt possible please understand and focus on ur career.but I am unable to focus .</p>
<p>I am also preparing for ielts so i can go canada stay wid him. bt I am scared too as he never says that he loves me..</p>
<p>I don't want to loose him. I am ready to leave my family too.. my grades too.. I wll study their .</p>
<p>but one of my frnd says that if he will leave uh than ? wt uh will do over their ? as I am going because of him only.</p>
<h1>GCI- I don't think that you should think this rashly. Professional life and love life have to be kept separately. And it should be followed like God's word in your case particularly.</h1>
