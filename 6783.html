<p>Hey Admin,
Hw are you,
I hope you'll be awesome,
You guys are doing a great job,
god bless u both,
I'm in a dilemma,
Actually The story started When I met A guy through FB, I found him very sweet, Then We decided to meet!!!
We met at my place, Had a lot of conversation and Laugh for 4 hours
When he went to his home back, I don't know why I missed him a lot, I don't know is it love or what but I love to be with him,
We met again after a couple of days, That Day we kissed, I never felt so good with anyone, He also loves my company, He loves to be with me and laugh at my silly jokes,
But the problem is He has a boyfriend who is very cruel,
His bf never let him to make any friends. He even don't let him talk to anyone, His bf thinks that my friend is his Slave....
You know He left his test series to meet me, he can't talk to anyone in his room so he has to go upstairs , No matter how the weather is he will talk to me, He gets wet in the rain while talking to me,
You know what, His bf has said "If you'll leave me I'll attempt suicide"
So, Doesn't want To be the reason for someone's death,
I know he loves me a lot, But he is little bit confused, Admin Plzz Help me I can I pull him out of the bad situation  and also pull him out from the cage, his boyfriend had made for him!!!!
I just want to see him happy,and He is happy only with me!!!!
Admin and The readers please help me!!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- I don't think that you can help him. Only he can help himself. He should have known better about to not be in a situation like this where he should be controlled by a maniac. And if he is living under the threat of potential suicide of his current bf, I don't think he is ever gonna take a stand for himself, and you will be a third wheel in their life. The guy you like is a coward, and his bf is a maniac. Not a good combination to be in a relationship.</h1>
