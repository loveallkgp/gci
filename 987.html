<p>Admin, its not that i haven't tried coming out of my shell, but problem is getting in a relationship-and break up at a young age has molded my character into someone where i neglected myself, it took a part of me who used to have fun going random places,restros etc.</p>
<p>Teenage is a period where persona is shaped and i lost that time period in sulking and i feel now i have become a boring person. I am tired of people calling me "Why so serious?''.</p>
<p>And John not really sure i am being judgmental but yes scared to let some on in maybe.</p>
<h1>Viv- If I were at your place, I would have literally felt irritated by my nature and proceeded to change myself. If I look at myself in my teen years and now what I am, there is one large difference in my personality. What you are in your teen years, you can never be the same throughout your life because you are immature at that time. And know that change is the only constant thing in the world.</h1>
