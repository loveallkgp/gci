<p>19 m Need a special help
my cousin used to have sex with me from last 3years but now i have fallen for a guy who is straight. I love him to death but i cant telll him so as he hates homosexuals. Since i have fallen for him i have stopped entertaining my cousin who has no emotional interest in me. But now he is blackmailing me to have sex with him. And i dont wanna do it with any other guy than my love. Is this right putting something on line for something that you might never have. :-(</p>
<h1>Viv- Your love? How could you call him your lover if he won't ever love you? Get your head working right. A reality check always does good. So here it goes. Where is your self esteem? He is straight. Its never gonna happen! But if you want your life to be full of troubles and humiliation, then by all means go for it. Move the HELL on! And don't expect your cousin to bring your ass down. If he tries to expose you, he will himself gets exposed. You can threaten him. Be not like a submissive guy. Get some swag weed inside and thrash the mommyeffers! BAM!</h1>
