<p>i have a lot to say.........it starts when i was 8, i was molested by my own uncle. as a kid i was so frightened of this incident that i couldn't dare to reveal it to any1. time passed, i got rid of him somehow finally when he got married. till the time i had dis disgust inside. I went for junior high school.....i started making good friends, since i was in all boys school, there were a hell lot of good looking guys. i realized that i had soft corner for my friends, emotionally i was so attached to them that school seemed to be nothing without them. During summer camping, we had to stay together for days......one night i felt an urge to touch one of my friends. it went well as he din't react. But next day on-wards my friend circle started ignoring me, i was too guilty. but it couldn't be changed. My performance got weak and i had to leave the school. in 11th standard i joined a new school for boys where i picked my way. i din't want the history repeated so i din't get familiar with much mates. since then i was sure this was a part of me for life. Then i don't exactly remember how, i became friends with this guy. he was like a true companion. He was very genuine and caring for me. I couldn't stop myself falling for him since i knew we had no future. i kept it myself. after 12th unfortunately i lost his contacts, we both left the city for further education. slowly he became the past n i started focusing on my studies. here in college i befriended with a guy who was hell nice to every1. he was so good that can't be explained in words. this was the first time i really had no control over my emotions and it lead to me being in love with him..
