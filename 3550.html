<p>Being gay is very selfish coz they don't think about their family kids parents or wife. A simple question what if all your dads were gay would u b born to c dis beautiful world? No you wouldn't have. All men should not b gay and get married everyone has to make sacrifice for parents and family. In Indian culture sacrifice is a must. Life is full of adjustments and it's wrong for gays to just think about their personal enjoyment. Think about the whole picture. You cannot ruin the whole family for your pleasure

<h1>GCI- Okay I had to calm down before responding.</h1>
<p>Lets just put you in a situation that you are straight and belong to a highly orthodox family. You got in love with a girl and want to get married with her. But your parents are strictly strictly against it. If you both get married they might even kill you. Would you sacrifice your love just for family? I don't want a diplomatic answer. </p>
<p>Anyways, now let me come to the real scenario here. Being gay is not selfish, first of all. Its all about accepting the truth and living with it. You'd rather want a gay guy married to your sister? As far as sacrifices are concerned, haven't we gay guys been making ever since we realized the truth about ourselves? Its for the parents and people like you to understand that its our culture to be more family oriented, where family comes first. What you are suggesting is through the fear of the society that you termed us enjoyment objects. Choose one thing. Family or society. If its family then you have to accept the reality no matter what-the-fuck-ever society barks. Lastly, being gay is not about having pleasure all the time.</p>
<p>Now bitch lemme go all punk ass on you, I am done with fucking patience. We guys get bullied, we are insulted on streets, we can't be ourselves, everytime we live oppressed by people have views like you and still you got the guts to say that "You cannot ruin the whole family for your pleasure "? Bitch, get some balls and read the effect that people like you have on us. You drive many of us to suicide, you rape many of us, you people turn our lives to hell, literally. And still you expect us to sacrifice ourselves for people who have trash brains? HELL TO THE FUCKING NO! GOT THAT?</p>
