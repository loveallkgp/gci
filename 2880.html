<p>Few days ago i went to kitty su with my girlfriends. It was fun i flirted with few guys and danced like crazy. After few drinks i don't remember anything. The last thing i remember that i was in someone else's arm in lift and into a dark room. I was completely blacked out and when i woke in morning my ass hurts and i could see a boy holding me. I panicked like hell he tried to calm me down but i started panting he said that nothing happened but i know everything happened between us. I was a virgin before i met him x( later i was confirmed by my bff's that i was so drunk he took me to his room for a rest and he was a dj at the gig. Few days went by then he called and asked wether we can meet but im refused him. I don't know how he will be of he turns out to psyco or something else. Im scared and i never dated anyone in my life. My heart says go out but my mind refuses it. Tell me what should i do? He is a complete darling. Im so confused :(</p>
<h1>20</h1>
<h1>GCI : somebody might have drugged you that night with date rape drug .</h1>
<p>if he wants to meet you and want to take things further then i think you shall date him . as you said he is complete darling it seems you like him . see in life you must take some steps to keep it going on . you just can't close yourself to people and stay away from them .  he might be nice guy . go on , date him but in a safe place .</p>
