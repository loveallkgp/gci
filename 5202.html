i love him a lot but it hurts when he is doing such things.</p>
<h1>GCI- The first question is why do you have to let yourself fall for him when he already had a girlfriend? Clearly you go to make nice choices in your life. Do not pay attention to him anymore. He is not worth it. The more you pay attention to him, more hurt you will get. Work on your well being and self esteem.</h1>
