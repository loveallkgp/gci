<p>i am 17, so i went to do some usual grocery shopping and there was a guy who was looking at me, while his wife was doing shopping (holding a baby in her hand), he was standing at billing counter and when i look at him, he sticked his toung out and licked his lips and then he winked at me, i was quite surprised how a married like him could do that? then he went out (and his wife was still shopping), i paid and came out and he was standing there at front of me, he was still looking at me (and that lane was utterly isolated, except us) and then he started touching his groin in front of me and he winked at me again, i was quite shocked how could he do that? what the guts he had? </p>
<h1>GCI- D I S G U S T I N G! But I'm not surprised by this. Lemme tell you my experience as well.</h1>
<p>Once I was roaming with my friend in a park and suddenly I saw 3 uncles standing a bit far away looking at us. When we went near them they started rubbing their dicks and started saying, "kar lo kuch", in an utterly disgusted way. We went home directly after that.</p>
<p>Second incident that happened was that I was coming home and the same park had a shortcut through it. It was around 8pm and it was pitch dark. There was no street light in the park as well. So I had my scooter's light on. I was passing through an S turn and on the last curve I saw a middle aged guy standing near his bike in white kurta pajama, and shaking his dick from outside the clothes when the headlight of my scooter fall on him. I just ignored and went on my way. </p>
<p>Idiots.. duuuhhhh</p>
