<p>well i was in a relationship with this guy for 9 months and things didn't work out in way what we expected. whenever i am in relationship with a guy, i put necessary condition forward- no sex for 1 year. this guy, he was sweet but only for first three months, he said very wonderful things and what boys usually do. i think all he did was just to have sex with me but i remained firm.  in next 3 months, he started promising me that he would never leave me, he will be loyal to and i don't have to fear and we both can have sex but i was still firm. finally in last 3 months he crossed all his limits, he got angry and he told me that if i won't have sex with me, he would leave me but he didn't do that, he started having sex with other guys and he told me that he enjoyed doing so, when i asked him why he has to cheat me? , he told me that i was not giving him what he wanted so he has to get it from others. he was a sex seeker, all he wanted was my body and not love, i am sure he had sex with other guys discreetly in our first 6 months of relationship, so i called him one day and told me that i am breaking up with him and he started using abusive language and so i hung up. i don't regret what i did, my love for him faded in our last three months of relationship. what i am finding is not a sex seeker to be my partner but a person who loves me unconditionally and so i put this condition forward whenever a guy wants to be my partner.</p>
<p>$ ABBY : see first of all i think if you said no sex for 1 year then he should have waited for one year . </p>
<p>if he can't control for few months means that man already has no control . how would he even hold a relation .  let him have sex .. just move on and find someone worthy .</p>
