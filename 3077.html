<p>Alot of tym I thought to post my confession to sm attended n popular pg. But always... I was not taken seriously. M 22 frm nw delhi.....a city of dream to me. I used to go metro n lot more to the mall.... as I love going places. But m always alone... m gud looking ppl call me cutex but... d thing is I m alone for many reasons. I hv a job... got everything ... wat I dnt hv is a love tht is selfless. I had this past of me.... which bcoz of my devotion cud reach to an extent of 1.6 yrs. But nw I find myself alone in crowd ..... A sit by benches alone watching guys too cute to handle thy give look
But I knw thy are so not of my type 'g' .But yesterday smthng unusual happened and as I use to sit alone at food courts a guy came n sat...He started eating he was in hurry dunno he was lookin to his phone every once in a while.i thot myt b a gf case ...... but thn he bursted in tears n tuk left his plate n ws crying awfully.Making sure tht nobody wud knw he was having hard tym he went into washroom I followed him i found he was crying saying plz understand I cnt live like this i loved u. He jus put his phn aside n was washing his face I took a glance over his phn it was written Dan I dnt knw I cnt decide ...I cnt relate u d way I used to. IT WAS A GUY shocking to me. I left as he did ...He turned n asked did u listen nythng I said nothing. He 2 as going n cried I stopped n hugged him dunno hw come. But yes I did ...He hugged me back.he unknowingly said he doesn't love me " said it's ok.he wiped in my arms n ithn he let ho of me n left alone taking hi. Bag into d darkness o cud nt ask his name nor the whereabouts yet he trusted n said those words I'm happy i cud b come a shoulder to cry on.. yet I regret if only I cud have said those words to him i cud b lucky to bcm smthng fr him. But yes I confess. ...I regret I let him go....lyk this but I hugged him n alrdy said in my heart I loved him....
Thank you for your attention. But I miss this guy I go tht restro daily. </p>
