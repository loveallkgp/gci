<p>My boyfriend..and we've been together for like a year now..
I was living in Kerala before..and like most people do..i met him through Facebook.. We became good friends..amazing ones actually.. We used to talk in Skype the entire night.. We used to turn it on while we were asleep also.. I love to see him sleep.
And one day he suddenly told me that he wanted to meet me and he came all the way fim Hyderabad to Mangalore..i went to Mangalore. We went to this mall there and started hangout. I loved that dude. He is elder than me. 9years age diff i guess.. But what ever.. He took care of me. I felt safe. We went back to the hotel..and there was only one bed. We sat in it. And he said he wanted to kiss me.. He said i don't want to be a creep.. I love you and all that. I was like. Hell yea!! We started kissing. And it was amazing. My first kiss btw. And it was amazongofabulous.. That next day he had to leave and i dropped him in the bus stop.. He bought me diary and asked me to write everything i wanted in it. And left..(he cried a bit too)</p>
