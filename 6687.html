<p>I m a gay and I m proud of it... I also have a girly nature. because of this no one supports me but my best friend always helps me. I also had boyfriends in past one of them used me physically and after using me throwed me like a garbage then one guy of Bangalore comes in my life who started giving me love but after two days of relationship he started asking money. I gave him in starting but after that he used to force me for money by saying I m his love and he loves me a lot and he will return  my money and if I refused to give then he threaten me for breakup and after two months  I lost my job because of all this and that time I need his support but he left me by saying that I didn't help him and I will never b happy andi m a curse for my family. After this this relationship ends and from now I can't able to trust anyone for relationship. But I m always proud to b gay.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, so next time don't date assholes. If you don't want to be used, then don't let someone use you. Have a rule that you will not sleep with the person for atleast two months just to make sure he is worth staying with. That will test your bond and feelings for each other. If you and him, both are genuine, things will work out. Otherwise, you can say him goodbye the next day.</h1>
