<h1>GCI- Honeyboo, there is quality in people called redeeming quality. People do change and it looks like that your ex may have changed. Although is guilt has been eating up his brain and since you haven't forgiven him, his own guilt has grown toxic for himself. You have talk with him and forgive him. I know he cheated and considering myself at your place, I would have the same reaction, but not after an year. Just talk with him once. Better to talk with him than let him commit suicide.</h1>
