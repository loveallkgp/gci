<p>Never thought this may even happen. You never know tears are rolling down my cheek.
Was at some gay cruising place with a guy in the night around 8 or so .The place was too isolated from public. Never know , police comes for patrolling. The time they came to us was the time we were about to leave , then those two big bullies of cops enquired " kya kar rahe the yaha ". They were two in no. . The one took me and the another one took that guy. he two was forced to say the truth and told will be let free once you tell what you were doing. I and he told the same thing that we were here for those fucks,sucks and all. They took both of us to the police booth. Took all information about me and him. registered our addresses and phone no.s . Beaten too. ( 21 and 22 years we are respectively). They made us know we wont be let free unless court orders so. we begged , requested but to no avail. He took photos too. I am feeling so scared of my identity . I am too scared of my life. Dont have guts to bear all this if reality comes up to the parents. At the end cop told , thank god you are in the right hands else others would have never let you free. He even told if these things comes up to your parents , the only solution for you would be suicide. I felt too embarrassed . When they got to know what I am studying , what I am into , They thrashed me more saying you are this great you do this.
A situation like dying has actually arrived. Since then as i stepped home, didnt have food, laid to sleep. pretended before family as i am slept. But now i am confessing here, to know admin's advise. The inner might of mine has faded completely. in the morning itself i have to go for a competition but couldn't gather enough spirit to be there . </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay first of all, no one has the right to ask any questions to you like that, not even police. Police of India are not at all professional. Nobody saw what you were doing so there were no witnesses. You could have just lied. But now the damage is done anyway. What they did was bullying. An assault. And they don't have rights to take photographs or anything.</h1>
<p>From now on tread carefully. What I believe is that there no court involvement or anything. They were just fooling around and nothing else. Probably they do this to everyone whom they caught there. I say, be confident and stop going to hookup spots. They are not good at all. Do your daily stuff and just forget about it like a bad dream.</p>
