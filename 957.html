<p>Need Help...!!</p>
<p>I'm a 30yr old Gay guy from Mumbai working in a call center
I'm very emotional guy with some disorders
When I'm emotional my mind goes blank &amp; i say anything to avoid the situation
Bcos of this many here thinks that I'm a big time liar while I'm not</p>
<p>I never lie intentionally
This disorder have spoiled my life but can't help.</p>
<p>Before i chat with anyone here, i do tell them about me &amp; my disorders, it's hard to understand me...</p>
<p>I met 2guys on Facebook, one from Mumbai (20yr) &amp; one from Chennai (24yr) who turned out to be a very good friends</p>
<p>I somehow started liking the guy from Chennai &amp; i approached him as well but he cleared me with the thought that he's not looking for relationship unless he settle down, we continued our friendship till yesterday</p>
<p>The another guy from Mumbai started liking me though
for which i hadn't had any clue</p>
<p>Somehow the guy i like (chennai guy) came to know about this &amp; he left me breaking friendship &amp; while going away he said to move on with the guy who loves me (Mumbai guy)</p>
<p>Mumbai guy want to be in relationship with me, but i told him honestly i don't have any feelings for him</p>
<p>Even though i got badly hurt, i don't wish to hurt anyone</p>
<p>Is it enough to be in relationship with the one who loves you even though you don't love him!?</p>
<h1>Viv- Wow! You got hurt and then you hurt someone. The chain of hurt it is. BTW, why don't you date that mumbai guy before falling in love? Get to know him, spend some quality time. Maybe you could end up having a great thing between the two of you.</h1>
