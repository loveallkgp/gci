<p>Hi Everyone!..
I'm 20 Years old Male from Chennai.
Recently i met a new friend, he's my neighbour but different building. His age is same as mine.
I'm a bisexual and never fell in love with men but I just realize that I started to like him.
It started like this:
One night I was in terrace listening to music and I just noticed that he was gazing at me but I didn't give attention to him as I don't know whether he'll feel the same like me but I started to continue listening to music every night after Dinner on the terrace and to my surprise i noticed that he used to come out from his room to terrace every night to see me and I think he's interested in me too. I don't know how but i started to like him and luckily i just met a chance to talk as our building was just nearby and last night he came to my house but we did nothing much, just talk a bit.
and now I'm so confused whether I'll tell him all about this or not. i Need suggestion. </p>
<h1>GCI- Why don't you just go with the flow and talk about various other stuff? Go for some movie or song discussions, cuisine discussions or general life based discussions. Before getting heads over heels for someone, I guess you should get to know a person properly.</h1>
