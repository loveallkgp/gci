<p>Hi guys i am from an orthodox family background. I came to know about my sexuality when i was in my final year when my best friend got girlfriend and i went really mad and cried for lot of time. Then the magic happened me and my best friend were fighting and i shouted that i loved him 2 weeks later he said that he loved me too we completed our masters together and moved to canada six years ago. Till last year everything was cool and then now out of nowhere my family wants me to get married
i love ace more than anything in world and cant leave him
any suggestions what i should say to my parents </p>
<h1>GCI- Say that you already found your partner and can't be more happy in life! You cannot give this up! Come out and be brave!</h1>
<p>PS- Can I meet you guys? I stay in canada too! Just asking! :p</p>
