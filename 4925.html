<p>I have crush on my best friend. We live together for 3 years in my graduation life. And had many intercourse with him. But he is purely straight and doesn't even allow me to kiss on lips. I am just allowed to suck his dick and foreplay in return sometimes he masturbate my cock. But I never revealed in words that I am gay. Though without the sex part we are truly best friends. We moved to our professional lives now and I am living in his city,Delhi now. So he comes to my room several times. Now the sex between us have been decreased. And we rarely sleep with each other as I have now 2 more room mates in Delhi. Recently I confessed to him that I am gay. But he is not homophobic he respects the homosexuals. But he doesn't wanted to grant me as a gay in the beginning as he wanted me to leave these things and live a heterosexual life for my parents as I am a single child. But told him I can't love a girl as he can't love a guy. Last night again we slept together after a long time and I gave him a blowjob like before. So I told him about a guy recently met in my area and I like him. He was baffled by my words and telling me to leave these craps and go straight. He could not took the words from me that I had sex with a random stranger guy. And warning me to stay away from these and also wants me to introduce that guy to him for talks. What should I do now?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well he likes to have sex with you but is telling you to go straight and wants to put some "sense" in a random guy? Hypocrisy level 100. Kripeya aise pravachankarta se dur rahe.</h1>
