<p>Today when the whole country is celebrating holi, I have no one to celebrate this day with. I am open to my mother, who kind of supports me but does not call me ever, after she got to know, and avoids talking to me. She does not want me to come to my hometown in Lucknow. I live here in Pune, working for a reputed IT company. I was treated as a joke in my school and college, so learning from that experience, I have stopped interacting with my colleagues. I don't look very good so people don't really want to date me, even after I posted my original profile picture. I came out to a few of my closest friends, though they said that they are OK with it, but their behavior changed, which can be seen from the fact that they didn't called me once since the college, and it has been 8 months now. Every day I go to office, come back and watch some TV and go to sleep. I go to watch movies on weekends and have food in restaurants, all alone. My question now is that is this the life God wants me to live for the rest of my life. Is death not a better and kinder alternative. I am not week. I have the strength to continue like this forever. I can even come out of the closet to my colleagues, but to achieve what??. Can anyone suggest what should I do. </p>
<h1>GCI- No. Death is never better. Do not even think about suicide. I have a plan if I had to stay alone for my life. I will adopt a kid and then live my life for him/her. Having people near you who don't even like you will make you only more weak. Just kick them out of your life. Try to make you life better by thinking about various alternatives. Move on to some other place which is gay friendly. I guess that's the possible solution for you.</h1>
