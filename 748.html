<p>hey #Viv &amp; #Abby..... hw r u guys?? i think, u both r doing a commendable job guys. cheers to u guys..... i also want to do sth.. u guys r doing......... :) :)</p>
<p>Well, here's my confession: I met this guy on fb... we talked &amp; talked.... &amp; actually talked a lot..... Initially i thought i was in love with him &amp; confronted him about that.... But, he always show me some attitude... He never said that he love me.... He always said "Dont love me this much"..... Also, actually in our journey, there were two tymes, when he left me.. i really dont know why.. &amp; that too without saying a word..... but, he remain in my frnd list but then i did stop talking to him.... then after 1 mnth., he pinged me.. &amp; start talking &amp; then confront his love for me...........</p>
<p>Now, in all the talking i told him that i was in a relationship with a guy in my past... for 4 yrs..... &amp; all that stuff.... Now, whenever i told him that i talked to this guy or met someone..... he start abusing me &amp; called me slut....... I want to tell u that, i dont meet ppl that easily....... m here from past 1 year..... &amp; talked to like hundreds of guy....... But, i hv met only 3 guys..... &amp; slept with 2 of them.... But, yar at that tym., i was not into any relationship with anyone.... &amp; i was looking...... It was just casual.....</p>
<p>Now, yesterday, i told him that i met a guy on fb &amp; he is gng somewhere &amp; requested me to accompany me.... It 's just a trip..... but then he start calling me prostitute &amp; told me to never msg him again......</p>
<p>Dont u guys think, he is controlling me &amp; he should trust me..... Whats the point of having relationship without trust..... I mean.... if i m in a relationship .. does that mean i should become unsocial &amp; stop meeting ppl.....</p>
<p>What should i do????</p>
<h1>Viv- Is the word "slut" so much insulting? BTW, as you guys are not in a relation you are free to meet anyone you want. Its not his problem. He should have kept his attitude aside earlier when you approached him. But now when he sees you as a free person and who is meeting new people, its getting on his nerves because you are not paying him the required attention. So, don't really feel bad when you are called a slut. You can say him "attitude hoe" in response and have a laugh about. :p</h1>
