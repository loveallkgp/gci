<p>I know this one guy,who's very thin,just ok ok look-wise but im seriously in love with him! I know he's a gay! He has slept with his close friend several times,not that he has told me that but i got to know from other sources! Im friends with him,not a close friend though! He talks to me normal,but i always try to seduce him! He had voted,and was showing me that he was inked from the skin just above his nail,and its kind of itchy there all the time! i held his hand and kept touching it,while talking to him...Im sure he knew what i was feeling inside! i was turned on! But i didn't know how to move this feeling into him! I
since then few more such scenarios happened but i was never successful in getting him know my feelings for him :-(
How can i tell him? will it spoil our friendship if at all i say what i feel? how to attract a gay?</p>
<h1>GCI- Uffff... Well if you were giving signals and he didn't get them, he was either dumb or he was not interested in you. Nevertheless, you can always go upto him and ask him right away but in a manner to not creep him out. Also, figure out that what feelings you have for him. Whether you want to have a friends with benefits situation or a relationship. The approach has to be different for both. Ciao, honey.</h1>
