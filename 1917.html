<p>Guys, does jealousy arouses you? I am 23 years old and had a girlfriend, with whom I had physical relation once or twice. Recently, my cousin, 18 years old, has moved into our house after taking admission in an engineering college in my city. He shares room with me. My cousin, though younger than me, is a hunk already. He is a macho guy with a masculine and well-built body. He is taller and broader compared to me, and this is the reason of my jealousy. That day, I had a glimpse of his dick which is quite huge. Since that day, whenever I saw his naked body, I get upset of jealousy and I am aroused. I start a strange fantasy of fighting with him and getting beaten by him. I end up masturbating thinking this. Is this normal?</p>
<h1>GCI : are you sure you are straight ???? though even straight guys are as curious about dicks sizes and bodies of other guys as much gay guys are .. ( found in studies ).</h1>
<p>but masturbating and having a thought of getting beaten by him ..... is not a way a str8 guy will think . or maybe your jealousy has developed a loving feeling towards him .. ( i am not psychologist but these things happen .. as i am myself curious person in human behaviour and often read about this stuff ) . did you ever in past had experienced this type of attraction towards men ??</p>
