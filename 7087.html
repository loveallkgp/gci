<p>I am early 30/s
virgin guy,  never fucked a guy or a girl. When i fantasize and watch porn, i always jerk off looking at nice cute asses and beautiful faces . I fantasize myself as a complete TOP. Though ass always turns me on, but whenever( thrice) i tried to fuck a guy, i lost my hard on. The moment i put on condom and try to insert, i couldn't do it. It makes me feel very embarassed when i couldn't perform and everytime i end up in getting me sucked. I never fantasise to be a bottom , nor the idea excites me. May i please ask other members, if they also felt conscious just before fucking and lost their hard-on? What did they do in such cases.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm...see u may have one of these problems-</h1>
<p>1- Psychological pressure of performing good all the time.
2- U may not be having that inbuilt circuit of fucking.
3- U might be having stress issues.
4- U might not be comfortable with tight asses.
5- Ur penis might be sensitive.
6- U might not be working out enough. That makes our body not so fit for sex and we begin to feel to have no orgasms during sex!</p>
<p>Things-to-do list-
a- Don't stress, work out, do meditation or yoga poses, eat healthy and stop over thinking and take care of ur testosterone level. Its that simple and it will take some time for u to rock on bed!</p>
