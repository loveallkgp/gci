<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am 23, gay, male. Hailing from a lower middle class family, I always wanted to be independent. I thought that once I get a good job, I will shun my family and live alone. Now I don't know why I am not able to do that, though I hate my family for sure, along with all the other relatives, but I guess I am too much afraid of living alone for the rest of my life. I have met many guys who claim to be wanting a long term relationship but every time we meet, we end up having some or the other form of sex and the so called relationship is very short lived, if ever existed at all. So, basically I am titsy bitsy rich, alone and very unhappy. I sometimes think of sex reassignment surgery as I always wanted to be a girl( I think I am one in every which way, except for that flat chest and repulsive penis). I don't know if it will make me feel better or it will worsen the things even more, cause at the end of the day this is India. People who have gone through that surgery please share your experiences, and GCI your expert advice is also requested. Thanks in advance.</p>
<h1>GCI- See, if you really want a relation and a long lasting one, don't give that much importance to physical intimacy. Have your terms and expectations. If a person is okay with what you feel, he will stay. Otherwise he will move on to have a new piece of ass. And take that decision in which you will be happy. Don't force yourself in a situation which can harm you in future.</h1>
