<p>I'm 17.. Once when i was travelling in the metro.. a man 35-40 yrs of age tried to touch my groin.. he was continuously doing.. i realized it after a while because it was very crowded.. when i gave him a look... he gave a creepy smile.. and i changed my side.. he was then also trying to come near me.. it was really creepy and disgusting.. it was my luck that my station came sooner and i came out of the metro.. some people are really filthy minded and disgusting.. their minds are only filled with sexual desire all the time.. its very sad to know.. i should have alarmed people.. but ft embarrassed to do so..I'm 17..
