<p>This confession is for guys who are more attracted towards other guys but they still want to marry a girl due to family pressure or because of society. I have girl cousin she was born in UK got married in USA (arranged marriage) They were married for about more then 10 years have 3 kids but now they are no longer together. They broke up because my cousin sister caught her husband watching gay porn on the internet. After that it all went down hill. I havent had the chance to have a face to face chat with my cousin to find the exact details as i live in a different country then her but i had chat my aunt ( my cousins mum) she knows i am gay and im very open with her and i can discuss anything with her without being shy or anything, so she told me that cousin's in-law's knew about their son being gay but still wanted him to get married so they could have grand children as my cosuin's ex husband is the only son they have. Her husband use to take some pills before sex (i guess those pills were viagra) to have sex because he wasn't naturally attracted towards girls and i guess that how they had 3 kids. So now they no longer live together and both of the parents dont want to give up their kids so the kids stay at their dad's house 4 days and with mum for 3 days and the following week their mum have them for 4 days and dad keep them for 3 days. After the divorce my cousin dosent want to stay in USA because all her family and friends are in UK but she can't move back to UK because her ex-husband lives in USA and he has the equal custody of the kids if he give up on the kids then she can move to UK and take kids with her but both of the parents are not willing to giveup on the kids. Life is not fair for my cousin she was a nice bubbly girl always happy she dosent deserve what she is going through and her in-law's don't give a f**k because they got the grand children they always wanted and the respect in the society but my cousin is a strong girl and want to put all the anger aside and be the best mum she can be for her kids. So what i am trying to say here is that don't be that guy who my cousin married, don't destroy some innocent girls life to make your family happy. Dont make your life, your family life, your future children life a difficult one because you can never live life on lies you can't hide lies for ever whats the point of living this life if you can't be who you are. God has given you one life, live the way YOU want to live not they way other people want you to live.</p>
