<h1>GCI- Read carefully. DO NOT EVEN MAKE A MISTAKE OF GOING BACK TO HIM AGAIN! NEVER! Its never good to leave your friends just for the sake of relationship. You do need your social circle and not even you bf can interfere in it. An understanding guy would never have a problem with your friends if you are loyal to him. He expected you to remove your friends and you sex buddies but had a gf to his side? Just kick that asshole out of your life and tell him to do this drama to his gf.</h1>
