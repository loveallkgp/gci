<p>i am twenty-five. I realized I was gay since I was eleven. And I always identified as cisgender male. I have never been with a girl. And I am neither very macho nor very feminine.
Now, when I masturbate or fantasize things, I sometimes imagine myself in the role of a bottom, sometimes I imagine myself in the role of a top, which is understandable because I am versatile. But sometimes I fantasize vaginas, while I dont identify as bisexual, whereas sometimes, I imagine myself having a vagina and getting fucked while I dont identify as transgender.
Also, I sometimes, wrap bedsheets around myself, and act like I cross-dress, I feel good about it. But I never feel any less about my masculinity.
Also, I am a bit autosexual which means I am attracted to myself. I mean, if I had a clone, he would perfectly be my type, and I love fantasizing a clone of myself making out with me.
Is it unusual or happens with others too?</p>
<h1>GCI- Uhhh mind is a complex thing. I always get confused by the gender related terms. Maybe you have done your research about gender identities, but have a look at the link below. You will find some term to relate to properly.</h1>
