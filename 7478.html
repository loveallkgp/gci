<p>it's so sad thing that I'm going to tell about my straight friend..</p>
<p>he's hot like seriously hot.. got 15k followers on instagram, 300-400 likes in each feed..
he's also nice as human in real life.. looks good..
and
the thing is that his instagram followers are mostly gays only.. he knows about my sexuality..
he's totally cool with it.. and loves me too.. so gay people follow him..
messages him , comments on his pics.. and he's totally cool..
he responses to messages he gets as many as he can..
adhe se jyada to mere sath hi rehta hi pura din me..
but everyone started thinking him as gay .. a gay guy seeing his profile followed many mutual gay friends thinks he's too and started exploring their lusts to him through messages.. bcoz of this his girlfriend started doubting him too and broke up .
he's not  homosexual.. i know him from my childhood..
still just bcoz of his followers comments and the way he talks to gay people too made people to think that he's gay.. just only bcoz of that virtual life..
wow..
and
now he's known with a tag of gay everywhere in circle where we live..
kya kya dekhna padta hai..
though he doesn't care about it . he says unke bolne se wo thodi gay ban jayega.. life goes on and all..</p>
<p>but still i feel bad about it..
straight also can face this shits in India ..
in our gay society we need to change our mentally..
gay doesn't mean sex only .. gay people also need to understand this..</p>
<h1>GCIL- Thank god for this sensible post.....It was necessary to have this message on board.</h1>
