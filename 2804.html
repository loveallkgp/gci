<p>HII ADMIN...... i want to ask 1 thing ....help me....
I met with a guy on PR.... WE started chats n calls... its about 4 months of chatting n calling..... He also message me on whatsapp like ...MISSING U &gt;&gt;&gt; I LOVE YOU kind of.......... Due to some reasons i want to delete my existing pr id and make a new one and i did so.... suddenly he message to my new pr id but he was not known to this thing that i am using that id.... he started flirting ,,,</p>
<p>today morning i asked him wat r ur future plans regarding relationship???? he said i m in Indian society .... I will marry a girl and also a guy whu will understand me.... i cannot deny this thing.... lets see which way the wind will blow and whom shouild i propose to?</p>
<p>Mujhe love u love u kehna relationship mein aana.... ghar par bulanay k bahane dhoondna taki sex kar sake ...... matlab is he genuine to me? if he propose me jo wo kayi bar bolta rehta hai then wat should i do?</p>
<p>looking forward to an early reply</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm... master flirt haan? This is just a pure excuse that we are in an indian society and we have to marry a girl. It never works out. We people want to have rights but they must spoon fed to us. We never want to start the change. We curse the law makers but we ourselves hide behind the veil of hypocrisy.</h1>
<p>Now coming to him, He flirted with you on your new account and all, he cannot be trusted. He may have been saying the same to 10 other guys on PR. Tread carefully. Don't let your emotions to played by him as just another toy.</p>
