<p>hello guys...I m from jaipur .a cute slim good looking guy .I m meeting gays since 2010.when I was in 12th class.starting days of my gay life was not good.some good and bad experience. but the fact of gay life which is my personal opinion that gays or bisexual mate for sex.they talk you because they want sex.after sex they will forget you even if u r good looking .because the sex thirst of theirs has been full.they avoid you.
second fact is that gay talk only about sex related topic.r u top or bottom?
is it necessary?
that's y straights hate gays because gays only want sex.
I really very disappoint bcs I m gay .no love no feeling here .sex is priority .
why god u made me gay ??
why??
I have no rights to live .plss kill me.I m very fastrat.why god u didn't made my patner .</p>
<h1>Viv- Listen buddy, its not like that all the gays are mad for sex. Your thinking cannot be dependent upon the people you interacted with. Haven't you heard straights saying, "Yaar vo ladki hai apne mohalle mein, uski mil jaye to maza aa jaye.. main to uski maa ke saath bhi kar lu." I have heard this, I have seen people making it a reality. Now if you add any tom dick and harry in your profile, you are gonna get the stench of disappointment. Keep your friend list to the people who are proud of themselves. You haven't seen the other side of the community.</h1>
