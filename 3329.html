<p>I have a weird pblm which I cannot talk about with anyone, I'm little chubby wid few extra pounds around my hip and my chest which looks odd like breasts, I would give anything to get rid of them, I told my parents that its embarrassing, they asked me to go to gym, no matter how much I gym, I still have them with me. my boyfriend likes them so much he crazily squeezes them when we r togather I told I don't like it and to plz keep away frm them, but he begs me to let him squeeze, I'm afraid they may grow large and ugly if he keeps doing it. so plz suggest me how to get rid of them and btw I cannot afford an expensive cosmetic surgery..</p>
<h1>gci- Ehhhh... you don't want to go for a surgery while that is the only option for you.</h1>
