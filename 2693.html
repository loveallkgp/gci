<p>Guys we all want gay love to be accepted with an open heart by our society and law.But seeing the present scenerio of law and mentality of homophobic people of our country it seems it would take time. My thought is ''can't we all LGBT people instead of participating in rallies do something good for our country and society.'' We all know that love is the only weapon through which we can win the heart of people.Being good and doing something remarkable would only help us keep in the eyes of people and they may unite with us to be accepted.We all are fighting against our own family, society and law.If homophobia can be removed law will change automatically.</p>
<h1>GCI- Rallies are required as it displays the out and proud people of the community which is indeed required. Being out and proud is indeed a necessity along with setting out some good examples. The voices must be united for the law to change and everyone should feel comfortable with their identities.</h1>
