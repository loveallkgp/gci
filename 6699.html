<p>Once upon a time and long long ago, in a far off village, there lived a little boy with incredible imagination and artistic capabilities. The villagers called him Jan. The boy was loved by everyone and so he too loved everyone ! He played in the meadows, ran in the fields, the flowers smiled for him and the birds sang for hi. People cherished his presence as he is true to his words and he held morality high.</p>
<p>There came a day in his life, as his poor parents wished him to study in the town, for that is their everyday desire. Like every other parents, they sent him to study in the university to a city which the legends speak of, well beyond the mountains, inside a deep green forest ! </p>
<p>The university was a fairy tale place by itself, men of learned taught science and students came from all over the country. sons of aristocrats and daughters of duchesses and Dukes, sons of farmers and daughters of Carpenters, stayed together for all they wanted is to be a wise human. </p>
<p>With mountains and rivers and lakes and temples, the City of the university is of scenic beauty. Our little-young Jan and his trotting horse reached there on an early spring. Determined, the boy was, to make a good study of maths and science and logic, To become learned and to become wise. and also to upheld his parents' names.</p>
<p>With flowers blooming everywhere and birds returning to enjoy the spring, there came the son of a Count !Even though his parents called him Prince Cornelius, people called him Prince Charming, as he was charming to all the eyes that saw him. They boy was equally bright in studies and in manners.</p>
<p>Seeing the lone little Jan, the young prince, as helpful as he is, decided to help him in settling in the city. "Hello, Oh young man!", shouted the Prince, "Vous saluer monsieur", told the boy politely. The first sight happened to be the best sight and the butterflies and bees, understood the subtle sweetness ! </p>
<p>Excited was the boy, to see an angel from heaven walking on Earth, stood frozen, petrified there speechless ! Prince Charming was indeed charming, With the bright blue eyes and a sweet golden hair and a face as manly as a lion, indeed, "he must be an ambassador from heaven, for he is of a divine beauty!" Whispered young Jan. </p>
