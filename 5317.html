<p>i dont know i dont know i dont know, but something is wrong with gays :(
So i cannot love gays, i can only love straight men.</p>
<p>these are the points that my subconscious mind can come up with when i asked it "what exactly is my problem ?" :'(</p>
<p>:'( scold me however you want, but i just cannot take away the idea that "Gays have a problem" :'( Any advice for me to cure myself ? :'(</p>
<h1>GCI- Well honey, if you cannot take the idea away then why should anyone even bother to waste their time to argue with you. To feel anything otherwise, you have to rack your head hard and be receptive of the non stereotypical things about homosexuality; and also that good, bad, lazy, freaks people are just people irrespective of their sexuality.</h1>
