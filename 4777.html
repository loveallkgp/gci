<p>I remember all those 3 years which we spent together and he left me. So Just yesterday I took so-called bold decision to get over him. I decided to burn all those letters and sell all his gifts and sovineiurs of our relationship to some nearby junk collector. I finally did so, burnt and sold things. So after doing all thingsbI came back to my home and sat on that rocking chair and then...my mind retrieved the flood of memories- That day when he told me that he really likes my rocking chair, then our first date, first kiss , those promises etc. etc. and then I realised that I can never get over him. So, I stood up , ran to the nearby junk collector's place. Letters were irretreivably lost but not those gifts and sovinieurs of our relationship but...by then the truck had left...
I don't know what to do</p>
<h1>GCI- Ummm, stop thinking too much about him. It is difficult, yes but you have to. I am over my ex. People do move on. You cannot spend your life thinking about the one who has already moved on or maybe he is dating someone. Why waste your energy by thinking about him who doesn't even acknowledges your presence anymore?</h1>
