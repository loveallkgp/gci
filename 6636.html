<p>Native Americans have often held intersex, androgynous people, feminine males and masculine females in high respect. The most common term to define such persons today is to refer to them as "two-spirit" people, but in the past feminine males were sometimes referred to as "berdache" by early French explorers in North America, who adapted a Persian word "bardaj", meaning an intimate male friend. Because these androgynous males were commonly married to a masculine man, or had sex with men, and the masculine females had feminine women as wives, the term berdache had a clear homosexual connotation.</p>
<p>Rather than emphasising the homosexuality of these persons, however, many Native Americans focused on their spiritual gifts. American Indian traditionalists, even today, tend to see a person's basic character as a reflection of their spirit. Since everything that exists is thought to come from the spirit world, androgynous or transgender persons are seen as doubly blessed, having both the spirit of a man and the spirit of a woman. Thus, they are honoured for having two spirits, and are seen as more spiritually gifted than the typical masculine male or feminine female.</p>
<p>Therefore, many Native American religions, rather than stigmatising such persons, often looked to them as religious leaders and teachers.</p>
<h1>GCI- It's all very good to read. It might have been true too. But as far as I have seen that after the massacre of 18th, 19th and 20th centuries the natives of North American continent were reduced in numbers, forced to change their culture, leave their religions and were made to follow christianity.</h1>
<p>There is a native tribe close to where I live, and from what I have heard they don't look at homosexuality with good eyes because of the bible. The colonisers that came to this land literally destroyed everything.</p>
