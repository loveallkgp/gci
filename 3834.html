<p>Hi Admins... I have confessed here before and now here goes another one... </p>
<p>Previously I had written about my junior and how I am getting mixed signals from him.. Well during Durga Pujas we were hanging out at his place, just us two alone... he took my phone and said he needed some apps... When he went through my list of apps he saw GRINDR... Then he said, 'Yeh Grindr app to...' and then immediately i said ki galti se download ho gaya hoga ya kisi aur ne kar diya hoga... After that some friends came over and we hung out... Bt curiously he didnt raise the topic again... Even if he knew what the app was about he didnt say a word to my other friends.... Bt i think he started giving me the looks nd all... I dont knw what to do?</p>
<h1>GCI- Ain't no straight person will know about grindr. They just can't. So in a way you both know about each other.</h1>
