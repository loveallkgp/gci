<p>Hello admin.
I am Arijit Biswas. I am openly gay, I am bit girlish. I love to apply makeup, I am very passionate about it
Generally I love the no makeup look but one day I applied bright red lipstick and posted my pics in fb wearing that lipcolour. 
I was very disappionted with some of the comments I got, few guys made fun of me and a guy said that I am a slut. I don't care about such comments but wonder why these so called manly gays have such a mentality thar if a guy opts for a bold lips the he is a slut.
I must tell people that if I am a girlish gay , it dosen't mean I am a pimp or slut or easily available for sex. I do have some dignity and self respect. I have an identity other than that too.
I will only fall for a guy who truly loves me, I hate persons who loves me because of my body or looks.
I am a girlish gay and I am proud to be so. I don't care what these jerks or so called moral police says about me.
I love the way I am.</p>
<h1>GCI : i think you are very very brave to be an ' open gay'  . its very brave to come out as gay in an indian society or country where people could harm you physically for who you are ?</h1>
<p>now on a serious note i think if you are open you have to be mentally prepared for what will come towards you as a result of being bold and self expression on internet or in public. </p>
<p>in a country where a girl puts red lipstick is called a slut , a guy doing the same will be called even worse . </p>
<p>anyhow be safe and try keep your fb pics approachable to only your friends and family . :)</p>
