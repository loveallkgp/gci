<p>Many confessions are here from guys who don't speak much English. Hence they write in Hindi. And the many comments and responses, even from the admin(great advice though) is in English and that too not just in elementary English but in a fluent and sophisticated one. I'm one of those many Indians who don't speak Hindi much. I do understand it a little. But I can neither understand many confessions completely nor can I respond to them. But many guys here do. Even the admin I'm sure, most probably uses Hindi as a primary language. So while responding to those guys, those who can, give suggestions in Hindi. Even the admin. Those who don't understand English, their queries on most internet sites are not completely comprehended by them. So. Do co operate if you can.</p>
<h1>GCI- I write in English because there are people in India for whom hindi is not the primary language of communication. They either use their mother tongue or English. So if I respond to a hindi confession in english, atleast people will have some idea about what the confessor is trying to say. It's not true that people don't understand english at all. It is taught right from kindergarten. How much broken it is, but at least I don't use big ass words to make it more complicated. So I guess my words are understandable by all.</h1>
