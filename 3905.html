<p>"Is homosexuality an unforgivable sin?" - a few lines taken from Prayers for Bobby , hope it reaches to homophobes :)</p>
<p>In the Bible,
Leviticus, 18:22 says:
If a man lies with another man, it is an abomination.
An abomination, in that time, didn't mean sin. It meant unclean.</p>
<p>Leviticus also goes on to
say eating shellfish is an abomination.
Or mixing fabrics...</p>
<p>Leviticus 20:13
If a man lies with another man, they both should be put to death.
And then he says the same thing about an adulterer, or a child that disobeys their parents.
And we certainly don't interpret that scripture literally.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy 22,
If a woman is not a virgin on her wedding day,
she should be taken to her father's house and stoned to death.
Why do we not Interpret these and focus only of Homosexuality as sin?
God's vengeance is great.
So is his compassion.</p>
<p>So the question is it's ok to interpret the bible any way you want? Is it okay to question god and his theories?</p>
<p><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*No, of course not. But the bible was written and interpreted my mortal men.</em></strong><strong>*</strong>*</p>
<p>N.B- And many of those interpretations were reflections of the time and what they lived.</p>
<p>I don't think God minds questions.
He might not be thrilled with all our answers.
I think blind faith is just as dangerous as none at all.
I've never questioned my faith. I...
I've never had reasons to.Sometimes to question it...
helps you find a deeper faith.</p>
<p>to all those homophobes,
u shouldn't hate us for being unnatural or different,  u don't hate your friends who are differently abled , do u? you don't hate your siblings or family members who are more strong with there left hand that the "normal" right hand trend , do u?</p>
<p>SPREAD THE LOVE , no one can change , one can only hide behind the mask .. help us tear off this mask by accepting us...  </p>
<p>Have a nice day :)</p>
