<h1>GCI- Damn! I did not see that coming! Sorry that your parents are getting a divorce. And honey its not because of you. They did say that it is a grown up thing and indeed it is. Maybe they were just not compatible. You have to let go of the burden. Maybe when the time is right, you will get to know the real reason.</h1>
