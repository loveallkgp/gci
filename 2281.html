<p>Hey! I'm the person that wrote #2272. Thanks for the suggestion and amazing comments. :) My friend doesn't mind that I'm gay but he doesn't want me to help people and spend my money. I'm not settled yet. But I'm well set off with life. My family won't understand. Anyways I see on one of the comments, someone says that its impossible to get a US Visa. No its not. The 65 people I have sent to usa is in a period of 3 years, which to me is not enough. I'd like to help more people! In other comments I see other people need help. If you need my help, could you please comment on this with your email and I'll email you. I'll try to get back to you soon as I can. And btw I'm no hero, I love to help people, I feel that as my duty! :)</p>
