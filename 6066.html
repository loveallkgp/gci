<p>Hi,
Please bear with me. this is gonna be a long confession.
I am 3o now. I was born and raised in Traditional Punjabi family. I was the first child and the whole family pampered me. I never have to ask for anything, as everything I could possibly ask for was provided. I was shy kid, used to play house with other girls from the neighborhood.  My family never said anything nor did they suspected anything unusual about it. I grew up to be this kid who was good in studies, obedient, honest and above all was not fooling around with girls. I was the ideal son. I had sexual encounters with one of my cousins and it kept on going till I moved to other city and he got married. Then I got to know the internet and made a profile on a site that was called guys4men.com (It's planetromeo.com now). I met other guys through this and was very promiscuous. I always regretted hooking up but wasn't able to control myself from indulging in it.<br>
I never was able to admit to myself that I am gay. And I still am bit confused on that. I feel embarrassed to be gay. I know there's nothing with it and I shouldn't be feeling that way. But maybe growing up in strict hetero normative homophobic society I am feeling embarrassed. How should I deal with it? Because if I am not confident enough about myself regarding my sexuality then how am I gonna let others believe that. Please help.</p>
<h1>GCI- Let go of the shame and guilt first of all. You like guys, so what? You have casual sex, so what? Everyone has sex. It is something really natural act that people do and no tradition, religion, culture can condemn it. I was raised in a traditional punjabi family as well with heterosexuality all around. Never even heard about homosexuality till I reached 10 standard. At first I was at so much guilt. But then I read information about sexuality, read people's articles, interacted with them. I preferred talking about people and their lives. That made me confident and the person that I am now. Good luck to you darling. Don't ever feel shame about yourself.</h1>
