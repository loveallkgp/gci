<p>Hey guys its a 20yr old guy this side. It was my cousin who introduced me to gay sex in my childhood days. In the starting it was just a fun practice. In the teenage i knw what is the reality. This thing created huge changes in my body actions nd my behaviour too. But i didnt cared. My actions attracted many guys to do that thing. But i m not a slut or something. The prblm with these guys is they nly want to enjoy no feelings. I suffered a lot nd i m still suffering. I have phobia of strangers. I m lying to oll my bestos. Nd the latest thing i found my mms on a gay site accidently. All those guys who enjoyed me as a sex toy living like proud in the society nd i m like a dumb guy suffering due to my past. It is my request to oll that we bottoms are nothing just a sex toy. Nobody cares. Its ur will u wanna suffer or want to kick there ass nd show them they matters nothing to us. Hope u understood my words. Never lie to urself. Do nothing which makes u a liar. #goodDay </p>
<p>$ABBY :here is this misconception that people do everything and then act like a fucking victim . was you so stupid that you didn't even knew somebody is recording you ??? </p>
<p>next thing is bottoms are sex toys because they let others use them ... you can't sleep with stranger one night and expect him to marry u in morning .... remember darling 'hook ups' or night stands never bring somebody in your life . its one day game. so if you want others to respect you learn to respect yourself first .</p>
