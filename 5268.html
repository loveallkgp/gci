<p>hi , I am in deep trouble ... am just writing to you so that u can get . if possible please shar e it as well.
I got married to the love of my life two months back . I really love her a lot and she also loves me alot. but I have been bisexual since a long time and I have also admired many guys in my life. but I have never made out with anyone as such . the problem is that I am also in love with my best frnd and i am way to close to him as well. I share almost everything about myself with him. but he is not aware of my feelings and he does not know am bi . when I see him I feel like kissing him and hugging him and touching him all over. he is just too good to me. he has always taken care of me just like how a boy frnd rake care. now he is also going to get married in a few months and I can't see him going out with another girl. I know if I tell him about my feelings, I will screw up my relationship with him for ever. but I really want to tell him once about what I feel. please tell what what i should do. I want to stay married to my wife, I love her a lot. but I can't keep my feelings within myself for my frnd. its killing me badly.</p>
<h1>GCI- Imagine yourself in a situation where whatever you like will happen. Maybe you will be able to see whatever that makes you happy. Also, after coming out of that situation, just know that if you do say any things to your best friend, what will be its repercussions. I cannot guide you to do anything, the decision has to be yours because this is not something that I should force you to do.</h1>
