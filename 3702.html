<p>I had dreams of getting married one day when i was real young.In that dream, I'd only dream of enjoying my wedding day n how it was gonna be one special day of my life. But never did I dream of any girl sitting beside me. o.O Never. I just never focused on that. It was not imortant to a kid, anyways.
Now the dream's long lost.
I came to know that I'm not the only one who feels this way and this 'wrong' way of feeling love happnes to like 1/3 of the people, and those people have actually got a name - "gays". I was gay and I couldnt do anything about it. Then All of u know what happens, same as everyone, I struggle to change...go through all those emotional hardships and later come to accept myself as the way I am.
Now, thing is, most of u want to marry a guy. But I dont. I dont wanna Marry at all.
But yea...I wanna spend my whole life with someone special for me...JUST ONE special guy. I know most of you'd say, 'yeh to bachha hai abhi...aur thoda bada ho jaane do..sari lovegiri nikal jaayegi aur janab aa jaayenge line pe aur shaadi kar hi lenge'! :D But Worng !!!
I know that I wont do it. No matter what my age is, I wont compromise more than this. I'd rather kill myself than to marry some innocent girl and live a life full of guilt. I know our previous generation had their reasons to marry and I have mine not to marry. 
Still there are many who r afraid about society, family, and other shits, n in the end, end up destrying their OWN life along with others, of course.
It's just my view. I know I am strong and I can put this. I know there r some who just cant manage doing such a bold step of NOT marrying and some even want to but cant. 
Lekin Himmat honi chahiye duniya aur samaaj balne k liye...bahot jee liye kide makodo ki tarah dar dar ke...ab kuch karne ka time hai...conservative thinkings n society ki FIXED cultures ko todne ka time hai.
I wont say any of u to do it....but I WILL do it..coz at least marte waqt mujhe feel hoye that at least maine apne taraf se apni puri koshis kari. I could be proud of myself that I didnt live a pathetic life...logon ko kitna bhi kyun na lage that I lived a poor/ miserable life not marrying but uss waqt only I will know how proud and guilt-free I'd feel...No matter if i ever get my boy or not...but mera decision final hai B|
Bas yeh baat hai jo main har din ek na ek baar sochta hoon ' I fool everyone but I CANT n WONT cheat my ownself  my own soul !!! " :) XoXo</p>
<h1>GCI- Even on a confession that was posted yesterday, people were saying to a guy to suppress his gay feelings and get married to a girl. What good will it do?</h1>
<p>Wish everyone had the guts like you have. :)</p>
