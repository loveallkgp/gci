<p>Hi guys. Its time to become serious. Our Indian Film Industry ( Bollywood and Regional) is portraying Gays in a pathetic way :( I have seen in many movies where Gay sequence is intentionally  included just to make audience laugh. Gay are being shown in too feminine way and also as sex seducer. This is Really INSANE . We are not an Item of Humour or fun. How dare those brainless directors show our community in such a nasty way. No gay in reality will behave like that as shown in those movies. Every thing is being exaggerated in highest possible hilarious/funny way. Even, a gay feels awkward seeing those sequences that appear in the movie. WE do have our dignity and we do respect our being. There are plenty of Gays in film industry and I don't know why those gays wont oppose these kind of sequences. I feel they are the real betrayers of gay community.Why cant the directors think that portrayals of such things will surely give negative impression on gays among the audiences. If this is the case, how will the society even try to change there notion on us. Gays are really a Sensitive matter and these kind of  bad portrayals of gays will definitely hurt the emotions of gays. Guys, we should not allow this inhuman thing to happen anymore because if we shut our mouth now, then this wil become a trend in Film Industry. 'LGBT' as a whole shuld be treated as normal and joking and portraying of any portion of the community in bad way is greatest Humiliation to the community. Even though laws are not in our favour , I request any gay lawyer if there , or any lawyer who support LGBT people, shuld look into this aspect and shuld bring Stay or Ban orders from the Court to stop these INHUMAN PORTRAYAL OF LGBT people especially GAYS ( Coz Gay Jokes are high in recent movies)  :( :(  Guys,Please thing about this . I beg you all for support and please dont encourage those movies having bad Gay sequence. # Hatredness # INSANE</p>
<p>$ABBY : i actually hate bollywood... its useless pathetic cenema . even i agree with u as these thoughts arrive in my mind to when i see them portraying like that which makes us easy targets of mocking and bullying  in schools and colleges as kids.<br>
i sometimes feel like making a good documentry  gay movie.... but movie making is a real difficult task as it needs money , proffesionals and serious people who actually wants to present gay people as people and not just clowns or funny looking people .</p>
