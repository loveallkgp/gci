<p>I don't know whose fault it is and whom to blame. Whether it is the fault of my hormones or the age. Currently Im 25 and not sure what I want from from life.Not sure if Im looking for a relationship or just the sex. I always dread of stepping into relationship with someone. There have been instances where I have been unfaithful due to my need of sex. Its hard for me to stay in a relation for a long time. But, on the other hand the weird thing is I want to be in a relationship. I want to feel all those things which other couples feel for each other. Past few days I have been feeling low as compared to other normal days. There's a strong urge for sex. Im always anticipating sex. Due to this Im not even getting sleep, doesn't feel like doing any work, no movies, no games; just sex in my mind. And this thing happens on regular intervals of 2-3 months. Shagging off is not the solution as Im doing it almost every day. But that's just the temporary relief of few hrs. Does this happen to everyone? This bodily requirement of mine is getting worse. Making me an irritated person. Growing hatred for everyone. And affecting my other daily works. So, I just wanted to know if its some kind of disorder or just the game of hormones bcoz I get this thing after every 2-3 months. Is being a sex addict bad? Or its just the need which varies from person to person. Waiting for my answers. (-_-)</p>
<h1>GCIL- No! U r a very sensible guy who knows the pros and cons of a relationship and there is this social conditioning working subconsciously that we need to be with someone for a better life. The research shows how good relationships are but life is not about relationships all the time, it is much more than u can imagine and understand and remember that people who are inert about understanding themselves know what they want and don't want in their lives and the spiritual quotient where self satisfaction is the norm is in a constant tussle with the materialistic and social norm.</h1>
<p>P.S- Just pick from the flow of life and don't complain on what u pick.</p>
