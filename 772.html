<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need help/suggestion. I am a writer at heart and have been writing about movies/plays/people/experiences etc. since last few years. But, recently my writing is revolving more around my gay life experiences. I don't find anything odd about it and I want to publish it. I am currently writing a novel. I don't know when it will be finished, but I am sure that I will be able to complete it one day. My question is that.. with all this discussions and negativity around, about section 377 and homosexuality, will I get a publisher? I wish to use my real name. But will that be a right decision? I was a bright student in my school days and my friends and school teachers still respect me for that success. I am afraid if they will be able to digest my writing without putting a label on me. Kindly help. Apologies for the grammar mistakes if any. Thanks.</p>
<h1>Viv- First of all, labels are for clothes, not people. Secondly, i guess there are multiple publishers who can publish your work. You just have to get in right contacts. Thirdly, do not let some other people's views tarnish your ambitions. Kiran Bedi wpuldn't become India's first lady IPS officer if she had though like that. Fourth, I guess there is a writer on this page who can guide you pretty well. And fifth, I think I didn't find any grammatical errors.</h1>
