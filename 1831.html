<p>$ abby $ : OH hunny .... don't be so fast in judging him. might be he is ignoring you for your attention or might be he has somebody else in his mind. but on that facts you have provided me ' its really not love' ..  i mean you attracted him and he attracted you and he proposed you and that's it .... where is dating stuff ... ' do you even know him , do you know what type of person he is'??? these things are important . </p>
<p>try to understand love doesn't happen like this. he might be player and you don't sound serious either . so meet him ( he is living 3 houses away ) and clear things up.</p>
