<p>As a regular practitioner of Yoga, i am receiving questions about whether yoga can "cure" gay and make them straights. so my answers :</p>
<ol>
<li>As many of you have already known, being gay is not a disease and its your orientation. BUT, BUT yoga can do one thing - be gay or straight, constant practice of proper yoga will slowly release you from the clutch of constantly looking for a sex partner / someone to live with, and will give you a sense of freedom, with which you can make your own destiny, - be it a married life or single life or public service life. if you wish, you can have a partner or be contented and have a joyful celebrated single life.</li>
</ol>
<p>So is someone eventually be cured ? in this sense, yes, Yoga can cure both gays and straights and shift your life from " in pursuit of happiness " to " in expression of happiness ". I am not expert in other benefits about yoga. But this one I said, is for sure. It will give you a sense of completeness in your life and make you to work for the planet, not for you alone.</p>
<p>I can say a lot about, what yoga has given me, made me, but this one, Lastly, My very life is the alms given by yoga. NONE of the classical yogic texts right from patanjali yoga sutras, Hata yoga prathipika, Gheranda samhitha, Ghoraksha samhita, shiva sutras, etc offer a cure to homosexuality. Its not even addressing about it but it can offer a cure to sexual / romantic compulsion and give freedom in the inside, to both straights and gays.</p>
<p>With immense respect to all Babajis out there, I respect them for what they have done, but this one - curing gays is funny. I request people who comment here not to have Hindu hate comments. or babaji hate comments. Admin, if you see it, please delete the entire post.</p>
