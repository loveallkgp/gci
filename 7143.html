<p>M 21! Tragedy is a word that defines my life! Since past 5 years ive ive been  into depression. Im feeling restless now! Im tired! There r my 2 straight best frnds (rohan and muzammil) and they know abt my sexuality that i am a gay! + used to love muzammil alot and he knows abt my sexuality since past 6 years.! He is v caring and supportive! Trust me though he being straight , we used to indulge in foreplay till december 2014! But after that he tried maintaining distance from me and we dint kiss ever after that! But rohan have no idea that me and muzammil used to get indulge in sex with each other! Me and muzammil never evr discussed abt our foreplay 
when new year 2016 started i was at rohan's place! We were in bed! He always made sure that we  dont come closer to each other in bed (i normally sleep at his place.. We love to roam at night time) but this night was no ordinary . He  asked me to suck ( he was very horney at that time) i thought he is joking and then he pushed my head down to his penis! I dont know what happened to me. I started sucking him over his payjamas . The i tired removing his pyajamas and he opposed me. He din wanted me to do it because i guess he realised that it was not good.! Then after that i removed his payjamas and started sucking him. Trust me it was an hour session. While sucking him i informed him that ' im sucking u just because u allowed me to do so and i kept asking to speak to me but he din utter a word from his mouth! He came, then i went to other room and i started smoking . He came there and asked me wheres the lighter. I answered him but din made an eye contact with him. In morning when i got up he was sleeping . I came to my house got fresh and then we all frnds went for to smoke. He din even look at me .. He din evn speak to me and is ignoring me like anything. And its hurts.
 I dont feel that its appropriate to share this with muzammil. 
 What do i do   </p>
<h1>GCI- That's why you don't fuck with your friends. When your straight friends tell you to get intimate, you slap them hard, drill a hole in the wall, and say, "There you go bitch. That wall is your hoe. Not me." At least try to stick to your self respect, if you have some and not spread your legs or open your mouth for those who will later blame you for it.</h1>
