<p>19,
If we are in a love relation, then it is must to understand our lover. Sometimes it takes very long time to understand. The best medium is to communicate. </p>
<p>Initially in relation we spend very happy time together over call and on time. But gradually we notice that there is not that essence of love like in early period lovers had, this doesn't mean that they have developed distance. </p>
<p>We obviously have some expectations from our partner, sometimes they are not full filled or we are deprived of the kind of response we want, this makes to feel very bad and develop a sort of misunderstanding. 
  Misunderstanding never let developed, everything must clear by the time. Whatever we feel just say to you lover,he will definitely understand. Never take such a step that make you feel regret in future.</p>
<p>Be open to him and never hide anything, this is sign of trust and loyalty. Communication and sharing view only not about romance or emotions but of advice and point of views. </p>
<p>Lover is not only a lover, he can also be proven as best fiend who help and advice in all the situations,  this point of view brings strength to the relationship.</p>
<p>{A trusted lover never point, looks or age or distance, only heart and understanding capability matters, just accept what you have and love who love you very much}</p>
