<p>Hi, 
I'm a gay and i'm not proud of myself. i am a terminal lung cancer patient and saw this page, so wanted to share my story before i die. Dont feel sad for me, dont sympathize for me, i am not worth it. i was only 8yo when my uncle's friend  abused me, did unspeakable things to me save for penetration. my brain shut that memory out and i was happy, but during puberty i dnt seem to develop the secondary sexual characters. my voice was girlish, i was too damn emotional almost like a girl, no hair on my body. i was a runt of the litter. my parents had me admitted to an all boys school to make me feel masculine. no one accepted me there, not a single person child or adult. classmates distanced from me as i was bad at cricket, the masculine game they thought a boy should play, never actually got the hang of it. plus my voice was weird, like a girl. the teachers ignored my question, as i was too loud and shrill. got beaten by teachers a lot, my other friends were spared. being innocent never knew the discrimination i was suffering. fortunately nobody forced themselves on me, i thank god everyday for giving me dark looks. being ignored i entered my own world, i did good in studies got in good clg. never expected anyone to be my true friend, never knowing my sexuality. untill i a guy made me his friends, we were single and feelings for him developed and i came to know my sexuality and orientation. he used to kiss me and was typically nice to me. but then one year through clg everything changed, he comitted to a very nice girl and i was ignored like the leftover trash. it was  too much. no friends , no one in family close to me, all that remained was alcohol and cigarettes. i drank a lot smoked a lot. but got through my clg with low cgpa, got a bad job. in the span of 31 yrs no one connected to me. 3 months back i was told i had cancer. and that treatment would be waste as it was end stage.
looking back to my life, i realize what i have wasted. 
sorry for wasting ur time, had to share with someone.</p>
<h1>GCI- I honestly have nothing to say over here. I just can't carry on right now.</h1>
<p>So many things are coming in my mind. Ignorance, no sympathy, no understanding or various sexualities can lead to a literal death of someone.</p>
<p>I just want to give you hugs.</p>
<p>Do you mind coming in the inbox. I want to share some words with you.</p>
