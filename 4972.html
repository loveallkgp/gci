<p>Hello beautiful souls,</p>
<p>In this post I wanna confess about the time when I was feeling low and depressed some 3 months ago...I decided to act slut because I thought of it to be the possible way to overcome depressing feelings....So there I was in the metros and in the buses trying to act as a tart...U won't believe what I discovered...On the first day I got a man in his thirties giving his number as he was in a hurry...next came two guys in their twenties whom I had 'picked' up from my college area in the evening...they bluntly asked for orgy and gave their numbers and went away as they were going to do it the very same day...next came a labour guy in his late twenties at the railway station...don't know what prompted him to do that and asked me to come in the evening to fuck...In this way on an average I met atleast ten guys i guess in a matter of two days...but wait the last one was really surprising ...while going back to home I encountered an escort cum masseur whom I had seen on FB....and the very next moment a man in his late fourties boarded the bus...I was sitting and he was standing beside me....and then suddenly out of the blues he started rubbing his cock with my hand kept on my bag....he too was drunk i got that by his body language....don't know why but I got up and deboarded the bus with him....after a few chitchat I got to knew he was a COP....and I was like OMG....I am dead...somehow shrewdly I excused myself from him and boarded a bus again....</p>
<p>Conclusion: Never think of having sex as the way to overcome depression all the time.....it may land u in grave trouble and yes sex is easier to find and love is rare to 'achieve'...yes achieve because love if would had been an entity to be found then it has the greatest possibility to be lost...so guys I would say that be the diamonds u want and be the beacon of light u wanna see for light is life and darkness the motivation to find THE LIGHT.....</p>
