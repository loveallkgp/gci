<p>Yeah I'm gay and yes I'm proud of it. sometimes I feell why is it important to come out of da closet I mean no straigjt ppl come out and declare that yes they r straight then why da fuck we have to start conviinving people . old generation and new generation are strugling to find a parallelbut hell no why da fuck we have to handle ol dis . why am I born in this era and then secondly why am I born in india wid cheap minded people . Ithey no nothing about gender identity and they laugh at gays I mean how could u be so stupid ypu are not at ol educated and then u laugh upon it . 70% people includes this and yeah this is da real india Umeducated barbaric</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, when straights talk about their sexuality, its just called talking. But when we talk about our sexuality, its called coming out.</h1>
<p>You'd be surprised that you are not in that bad condition. Its okay that we want equal rights in India but if you compare it at an international level, discrimination is too much in USA, Russia, African countries and Middle East. Even if some countries like USA have passed the marriage equality law federally, there is still too much hate. LGBT teens are still killed, discriminated upon, bullied and many of them suicide. </p>
<p>The main point is that the world is at the crossroads of modernization and the old "cultural" values, Some factions want to stick to the older traditions where homosexuality was ignored or wasn't payed attention too and some factions clearly want an equal structure in the society. It is everywhere and not just in India. </p>
<p>In the end, whatever your expectations are, you have to start acing upon them yourself. Each one teach one.</p>
