<p>Hi,
This is not a confession. I started reading confessions on this page just few days back. What I realize is that many gay guys act on use and throw policy. They meet online and say all crap like "i Love You" n all just to woo him. Just after few texts, calls or chats they fall for you. Shocking, isn't it? They would tell all crap that they want to spend their entire life with you n all. When they meet they go straight to book a room in. A hotel to have sex. If you say no, they leave by making an excuse. If you play along, they get what they wanted and then they part ways. Just never to look back again or reply your texts or calls. And would proudly tells others he was very clingy, u know. Alarming, isn't it? Just after having sex he figured out ur clingy. They use people and throw them to suffer. "Apna kaam banta
Toh Gaand maraye janta".
I wish that someone does exactly the same to them as what he did to others.
I know many of the guys over here as well belong to the same category. They think that they are super handsome and intelligent and invincible . But they forget that whatever they are so proud of won't last long. So they should get down from their high horses before it's too late. Arrogance, over confidence, over smartness, etc etc will cost them dearly someday.
Do you guys agree. Do leave comments.
Regards</p>
<h1>Viv- Ooh! I do know to whom it is directed. The word "clingy" reminded me. Anyways, you are totally right. People be like, "Oh I am a celeb, I get along with people so easily and dump them even more easily." Bitches please, if anything they are good at is being arrogant, shallow d-bags. BAM!</h1>
