<p>I was born and brought up in southern India town by poor family. 
Most of childhood and teenage was horror because of acute shortage in money. I progressed well in my studies and now earning handful salary. My parents were happy and I got appreciated by every one for my transformation of what I am now to that of my previous condition. This is my outside life but from inside I am still in poor condition. Before I knew the word gay, I was attracted to guys from my childhood. Trust me I saw internet,mobile and latest technology
in my college life ( some people believe media responsible for gay thoughts) . In my college final year finally I had desire come to true, yes I had sex with my roommate. One more in my earlier career days with my office colleague 
who was also my roommate ( happened 5 years before). These two attempts were merely sex and no love involved. 
It was just based on sexual need so after they got girl friend, avoided me. I didn't blame them for leaving me
because it was me who initiated and finally had mutual agreement on sex. So to get new partner, I started using fake fb profile
and I have interacted with more than 500 ppl all around India even other countries. Few are true from their heart
and most of them want only sex. In 6 years of my fb and other dating site, I learned that I am ugly gay.
To describe me, I have Elongated faced , large eyes, lengthy nose, big ears, no cheeks, baldy head , dirt color and finally week body (only bones
and less muscle) . since my childh0od, many ppl mocked for my appearance but most of rewards I got from our community.
Brick face, aids boy, baldy ass, Owl eyes guy, starving ass who don't even has cheek, real avatar (animated movie ) look
and more. These are comments I got from fellas in gay life and one guy even said you have fucking face.
80% of ppl block or stop replying to message, once I share my picture. 15% ppl will loose interest in me and just
have normal chat. Few desperate guys will continue chat with me for sex and one such incident  where I met him in his apartment. He didn't talk much and took me to his room. He was upset on seeing me and I asked what happened.
He said nothing and lyied down in bed. I went near to him, I tried to touch him but he was quite unhappy.
He said, suck me and leave.I was broken inside and I asked don't you to like to kiss or hug me. With sarcastic laugh,
he said , have you ever seen your face in mirror. My heart was feeling heavy and tears were about burst. I execused myself 
by saying, I left key in bike and will get back. I moved from his apartment immediately with profound tears rolling 
on eyes. That's not first time I got humiliated but it hurt my heart because I wasn't worth for kiss also. Even before this incident, many times guys who chat with said " I dont feel neither love nor lust towards you"  but they were virtual. 
After this incident, I was shame on myself for my appearance. I avoided seeing mirror and sometimes cry alone for my look. It took almost 3 years to accept myself for what I have. I neither tried to hurt myself nor had suicidal thought because I struggled since my childhood for existence so I will never get those thoughts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>      I have seen many confession posting here that, they had boy friend, break up and so on. Till now, I didn&#39;t even had one boy friend. Forget
</pre></div>


<p>about bf, I didn't even had kiss, hug based on love. It makes to feel bad, some times jealous when I see gay couple. Some time wonder how gay love will be. I didnt had sex for past five year not because of non availability of guys , cant give up my self esteem for sex ( who ill treat based on my physical appearance). Recently, I turned to 30 and age is taking toll on my appearance more. I have tired all resort to find good companion for my life ( I visited gay friendly ngo as well), but till now no luck. I still have hormone running in my blood to kiss, to hug, to love, to intercourse but my hormone isn't worth in this world.
I am not going to blame any one for my misfortune because I understand how appearance is importance to this society.</p>
<h1>GCI- Listen, I will be real here. If you don't like something, then you should take measures to at least transform it a bit. I am not talking about plastic surgery. There is something called maintenance. If you want to have a personality, it takes effort and interest to look appealing in this world full of beauty standards set by media. Go to gym, get healthy and things will improve. Honestly, dark skin colour is not a synonym for ugly, neither is bald head. Stop criticizing yourself for no reason. Rock it whatever you have.</h1>
