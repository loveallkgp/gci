<p>I had Like this page month ago and was always Disinterested to Read whateve people wrote but today I don't know why I just read some of the confessions and I saw that ya , Its a lil version of Counselling I guess , haha <em>_</em>
So , lemme do my lil effort to seek what I wish For..
Em 16 and Son of one of the most Renowned Personalities of India and Dubai ..
Was in Hostel from my lil hood and just got back to india last Month .. : )
What I noticed is that no Matter how much money , Fame or Glory you got .. What matters is The love and Parents Support Which I always Wished For ..
Though my Parents belong to Fashion industry but still they Hate gays : ) , No matter how broad minded they pretend to b ..
What would a teen expect from his Life ?
Love ? Friends ? Parents Near to them ? Care ?
But what if you got all of this by your Paid servants Not from your Parents ? : )
Uhm , so This is Me .. Who always Wished for the lil common things instead of craving Big ..
Em Gay but can't accept the reality too that my dad would bury me Alive : )
People think that rich personalities have Perfect Life but dude , Perfect lives are Granted to Middle class families , at least they Do have a family who be together always and stand by each other unlike Ours , who meets each other after months : ) and stand by on those Topics which effects their Repo likely ..
I mean ya , I too was Diverted .. I was only into classy men , Built lil ego in mah Self which was undoubtedly not Needed but yea , Atmosphere do Effects .. I use to Reject those Guys who were poor or I should say who belonged to Middle class family , I Rejected those u don't use to wear Brands ..
But now , I regret : )
All Left Alone , No one to care .. No one to love : )
Feeling like I should have got a Restart button in my Life ..
Em just here , writing this to be Very Guilty of what I did which I Shouldn't ..
And
Ya , no Matter how rich you are .. Till the time u dint got real Friends or supporting Parents with you : )
Its Better to b Poor then ..
Money can't buy fuckin Happiness ..</p>
<h1>GCI- I feel sorry for you , love. Things will come around and you will get the love you desire. Just keep the look on the horizon with an open mind.</h1>
