<p>"""...omigod he had nail paints done and always has a limp hand. And when a friend of mine started smiling looking at him, all of us went into fits of laughter. The boy then came to us and said he is really like 'this' and loves men (courageous man, I must say, want to meet him). We all got scared and went off."" My sister, between hysterical laughing, managed to tell the whole story about a guy from her college who apparently was gay according to her and her friends. 
I was speechless. Whenever she brings up a gay discussion, all i do is try to change the topic or pretend to be busy doing something..anything. ""He might have just said for the sake of saying."" I said softly, too afraid that my expressions will let her know that I too am one of 'those' people. 
""Oh come on, he really is gay!"" she said firmly. 
""Let him live his life then. He's not harming anyone. What do we have to do with them."" I couldnt resist to say...I was feeling terrible inside. I gathered courage to say this.
She started again ""Well everyone should maintain distance from such people. Especially MEN. You stay away from such GAYs, you get me (Lol, only if she knew how badly I wanna be with such Gays :v )"" 
""Alright alright...shut up m busy."" I tried to stop her.
""You shut up, m ur elder sister and its my duty to protect you (protect? yea, sure :/ only if u knew what massive hurt u just did that thinking of urs :( ) And u know such people even marry and live with women but have relation with other men, i've heard, They surely will go to dojakh. Allah's wrath surely will fall upon them. But why m I telling u all these..you're too young. Just say away from any person u feel suspicious okay""
""God, m 19. I understand such things already, I know more than you ever will ! "" I spat back.
""Dont try to sound over smart to me u little boy. "" She playfully slap my arm.
I love her. I cant hate her for saying such things. I mean it really really hurts but I cant blame her...its the fucking society and our stereotypical orthodox thinkings designed by our 'great ancestors"" 
Such incidents make me weak inside and make me want to go away somewhere ...somewhere where there is peace..and him :) and no worries. I wonder if things will ever change around me ever in my lifetime :( "</p>
