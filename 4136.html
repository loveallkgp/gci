<p>Hi Admin,</p>
<p>I'm new to this page and I really appreciate your efforts in helping people with their problems. This is the very first time I'm even writing about thing I feel or perhaps having to admit them to myself. I'm so afraid that even my hands are shivering...lol. Anyways, I'm just a regular(somewhat harassed) guy from India and I've relocated to US for my future studies. While I was in India, I thought being here in the world's capital city would help me figure who I am or what I am (dont know where I fall into the LGBTQ). Now I'm seeing people, classmates with someone (gay or straight), makes me feel lonelier than ever. After reading few post on this page, I kinda feel weird, since I'm 23 and I'm still carrying the big "V" over my head. I've a decent family who is very supportive usually, but more than often I have quite opposite views from theirs. I mean most of us are not even religious and believe in humanity, but my mom freaks out when I mention to get some crazy haircuts..lol. 
Thanks,
Daniel</p>
<p>P.S. I feel like breathing for the first time, heart pumping like crazy.</p>
