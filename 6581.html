<p>I wonder if it is just me or none of the gay guys have straight guys or any guys as "BEST" friends I feel really bad about it. There might be a problem with my social skills as well but I do have few girls as BFF but not any guys.I talk to guys but none of them are my "BEST" buddies ,they are just friends. I have been best friends with guys earlier but life moves on ,friends change, we move to different cities and all. Almost everyone seems to have a BRO for a lifetime and I don't . Sometimes when I am with a group of  guys, I really don't have enough so speak about. Also I suck at sports , football and cricket which most guys play. I play tennis ,badminton or go for a swim or workout at the gym. So is it my  silence on sports or girls related topics that turns them off? Please suggest me something which can be helpful so that I can also have  brother(s) from another mother(s) as well. ! #SocialProblems</p>
