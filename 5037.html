<p>well came out to another friend yesterday!</p>
<p>i think she had a crush on me coz first of all she was very very shocked. She thought that i was with another girl
Anyways she was ignorant at first. She couldn't believe that i was in relationship with a guy. I told her some statistics. But she was convinced later and was happy that i was happy with who i am. She said that she could now share each n everything with her.... well our bond just got stronger.
i felt so relaxed after coming out to her.
Well and while i was telling her all this we were standing on metro station n people were staring me like hell coz i was laughing heartily with her n giving hi-fives.
well we entered the metro n i just joked... Oye woh dekh....itna hot banda! And we laughed our hearts out!
Well to all those guys who are struggling... it only gets better with time...</p>
