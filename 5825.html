<p>Hello admin , i am regular reader of ur page nd i want to share something , 5 year back , i was started dating guy nd after 6 months (in those month we knew each other) we went to relationship , one weak later we had sex (except anal) , i was totally given my soul to him. meanwhile he told me his parent forced him to get married with girl , hearing this i got emotion but i controled it nd said him "if his parent wants he must obey" , he said to me he cant live without me bal bal .... After few week he got engaged nd than married with girl, after marriage i called him and asked abt his marriage life he told me everything is now gud nd he his happy with that girl." i got emotimal again nd cried alot , then i concered my self nd i changed my no , my real id evrything becz i didnt want to spoil my bfs marriage life , . But i made his prsence , i had been followeing all rules nd regulation keeping fast loyaltiy eveything of being as bf for 5 years, even thoug i have not been sex for 5 years, few days back , i got mes on my real id from my bf that "he want to talk me nd send his no " (i didnt understand hw did he get my id), i called him i was emotional but i hadnt shown to him over phone , ### u no what happen over phone conversation.
He told me (In hind "" tum chacha ban gaye ho, maine bahut happy hu apne wife ke sath hum ek dursare ko pyar karte balbal .(during convo he never asked abt me wheather i m gud r nt ) , ,aur kaha ki tum bi shadi karlo bahut jaruri h nd all " i got really angry when i heard abt all these thning than i trund my nd said angerly (in hind ) "mujhe g<strong>*d marna jada pasand larkiyo ki ch</strong>t se .{means i love to fuck ass than pussy }nd i also mentioned , maine uske bache ka uncle walcle nai hu" (sory i used abusive words) nd i cut phone i felt very bad nd cried alot becz my bf didnt undestand my agony .Even i had been following my relationship alone total alone for 5 yfarr Now i m feeling repent to say all those thing plz tell me i was rit or wrong ,what should i do nw..</p>
<h1>GCI- hmm.... See dear i totally empathise with u..Now calm down sweety and just listen-.</h1>
<p>1- U did many ryt things for a wrong guy...that hurts more...
2- U dont need to feel sorry for urself...love urself the way u loved thyself before..now even more bcoz we have to stay with ourselves most of the time.
3- Try to understand that u were actually courageous in trusting a person and letting go of insecurities..it is not always possible to get reciprocated feelings..this is where we lose..expecting people to love the same way we loved them...
4- Dont ever think he used u...he actually fooled HIMSELF by being closeted again and taking up a camouflage...
5- People come and go...but dont think u need to stick around...DELETE AND ELIMINATE all kinds of toxic people from ur lives...no one is worth of that....U owe a responsibility to ur soul first..not to others' emotions all the time...
6- U actually dont need to forget ..but remember only the good times..bcoz negating our existence sucks up ur strife for peace..
7- He TAUGHT U THAT people need to be understood from the soul more and not from the fake actions as many do it in the gayworld...
 Bless u honey!  Now say I LOVE MYSELF Even more....and listen to TAYLOR SWIFT - WE r never ever gonna b back together!</p>
