<p>Hey guys.....I jst want to ask something from u guys is it possible ki ap kisi ko luv krne lgo weather apne us admi ko dekha bhi na ho...jst chats se apko usse luv ho jaye...
Many guys says tht they want luv here looks doesn't matters for them...but I don't know how is this possible apko us bnde ko dekh k vo feelings bhi to anni chahiye jo ap apne partner se expect krte ho....
If I want a gud looking partner to uska yeh mtlb to nhi ki mujhe luv nhi chahiye mujhe jst lust hota hai...I m really confused .....</p>
<h1>GCI- Watch the 'Japanese wife' and 'Sirf tum' movies to get your answer on a romantic note and on the practical front I would say-</h1>
<p>1- No its not possible to fall in love from all the aspects because practicality is missing here.
2- Looks matter initially but eventually its only love that remains.
3- Love is dependent on all the factors of being with someone unconditionally as well as practically. Say for example, a filmstar may marry hi/her fan but eventually that person has to match his/her persona.
4- Virtual love is the new norm, but remember it follows all the old age tactics as well as creates the new world norms on an individual basis.
5- Cognitive aspect is the soul and rest are mere mirages in love, but also remember that asexual, romantic, sexual, platonic and intellectual attractions define love for most of the people in love.</p>
<p>P.S- Lust is an aspect of love but it is meant for a single person (monoandrously) and polyandrously it defines the tendency to feel for some people and not all.
Love is not dependent on lust but lust is dependent on sex most or all of the times.</p>
