<p>18 m , dont know how to swim
Today I hit the road again . Im a high school graduate and after 3 months of trying efforts by doctors , Im back on anti depressants . My life in a nutshell is ZERO . I am hollow from inside , not shallow , holllow . Hollow due to the supplements and anti depressants and anti anxiety pills I've been taking . I'll admit I have come a long way , when I was in XI , I had to take sleeping pills as well . Amongst some other things , the major reason for my depression is my sexuality or my society's attitude towards homosexuals .
As I started to grow up , my parents started to have a little bit of the bird and the bees talk . I belong to haryana and Im a jaat . Oops ! Big problem there . My parents have made it clear to me that should I ever consider marrying some non-jaat girl , they would disown me . And not kidding , I've seen this happening with my uncle . I recently got accepted at Virginia Tech . So yay ! Not saying that my parents are crazy rich or something but ya they can afford it by going a little out of their way . Now long story cut short , if I do get a visa and subsequently go to study at VT and graduate within four years , I intend to tell it to my parents that Im gay and well the subsequent disowning thing .
However , it kills me that my parents would spend something like $44k a year on me and in the end I would do this to them . I love them and I love India but these two feelings are the ones because of which Im in depression .
Sometimes I get this urge to just kill myself and sometimes when my parents are bad to me , I just think about going to the most expensive university I can find but then the reality dawns and its the same thing all over again .I find myself in a deep sea of quicksand and I dont know how to swim , so there's no trying either .
Thank you for letting me vent it out !</p>
