<p>So, I'm the confessor for confession #5795. For those as lazy as I am, here's how it started- "It's sad sometimes to be alone. I am originally from Delhi- yet never found anyone quite like me. Everyone's just after NSA and sex..." Yes, NSA is No Strings Attached, as some pointed out.</p>
<p>Anyway, this one's going to be long. So brace yourself, or leave, whatever. Either way you can't finish reading this.</p>
<p>I lost faith in people again after I went through the comments on that post. People impersonating a guy who is genuinely in pain. Wow. A tad too low, guys? Just for the record, I did not get in touch with anyone. That was my first time confessing, and this will be probably be the last. I can't be the one to approach people- I am too socially anxious like that. That is probably I'm confessing anonymously, see?</p>
<p>Anyway. I pity you who reach out, impersonating someone else. Starting something on the foundation of a lie. But I envy you too. I sound so holier than thou, I can't believe myself. I sound like those pricks that keep harping on about Indian culture- and then lampoon it in the West. I hate them, but this isn't about that.</p>
<p>I could go on, about homosexuality- about loneliness- about emotions galore, but meh. You've heard all of this before. As I take clinical help for depression, my doctor tells me the biggest red flag in depression is not when you feel sad, like people think. It's most dangerous when you stop caring, everything ceases to matter. It has for me. You can go ahead and read this- and then comment asking me to reach out but 9 chances out of 10, I would not. I really have stopped caring.</p>
<p>I just want out. Out of this loneliness. Out of being misunderstood. Out of this secrecy. Out to life.</p>
<h1>GCI- There was a reason i wrote a post on fake guys! Hope u got it haters!</h1>
