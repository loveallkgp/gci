<p>I dont know why i am wrting this .. But still wrting it .. I am proud to b a Gay and i wanna b born as gay again for my Guy !! Love him to the core from my heart ,mind ,body and soul. My love for him is eternal. But i know i cant make him mine in this life as i dont look good. I am ugly and he is cute.I am elder to him by 3 years. I never wanted to love him , as i knew he wont accept me ever..but it just happen.. He deserves someone more handsome than me.i want to take a rebirth and wanna have him in my arms. We were bestest of friends earlier but now its all finished..He never respected me..use to ditch me,insult me every now and then..but still i never stopped loving him..so i just took myself away from him..Now, Havent seen his face past one year but my love still remains the same.</p>
<p>Past one year ,i have just destroyed everything. My personality, myself ,my job,my career.lost my self confidence but somehow managing my life with broken heart.i am shattered.just doing it somehow.</p>
<p>I hope he remains happy wherever he is.i pray to god his progress and prosperity. But U r mine ..i will take a rebirth with good looks ... Wud b mascular like salman, cute like RK and flirty like SRK ..and next life ,u will fall for me.</p>
<h1>GCI- Why do you still have to feel for him? The person who insults you, uses you and ditches you, can't be your friend. And you left all of your dignity for that one guy who wasn't meant to be yours? On top of that you ruined your personality, your career and your confidence? EK baar bhi dimag mein khyaal nahi aaya ki tum apne hi dushman kyu bane hue ho? You may have loved him or whatever but you surely don't love yourself otherwise you really wouldn't have gone through this. Honestly, skulking around in self pity doesn't do you any good. He won't come back to be even your friend. Rise up from this and be successful.</h1>
