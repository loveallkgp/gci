<p>Conquered myself, and accepted.
Introvert, hence, not out as of now, and don't have any plans in near future.
Aaj tak lagta raha ki hum kisi ke kaabil nahi hain, aur apne aap ko kisi ke kareeb hone hi nahi diya. Koi aisa nahi, jise mai apna 'best' friend keh sakun. But, it's late January this year, and I start talking to this girl (my batch-mate, earlier we hardly talked). We hang out, have fun, share our feelings (she doesn't know of me being gay).
But, suddenly, a long message, i appears inbox, which expressed her feelings for me.
<em>speechless</em>
<em>throat choked</em>
<em>fingers trembling</em>
Asked her to wait for the right time, for I'll open up myself before her, and tell her something which had been only into my head all these years.
Also, assured her that this wouldn't change anything between us. Her expression has brought her even closer to my heart.
But, the thing is that, I am not at all mentally prepared to 'come out' to ANYONE. I'm afraid of the consequences, which'll follow the same.
I fail at judging people, hence prefer keeping myself away from others, getting attached to someone emotionally.
This is how I am. I want to change and be with people. But, the fear of failure fails me.

<h1>GCI- You might not be prepared to come out to anyone, it won't be logical enough to keep her on the hook. I know that you are scared of being judged, and what if the girl is vengeful and dramatic? I'd say if you do tell her, do get to know about her more and see what she thinks about alternate sexualities and stuff. If she feels like the right person then tell her. Who knows she might become your best friend. If she is judgmental and you worry about your visibility, then break the ties without coming out to her. It may seem harsh but it will be better for you both.</h1>
