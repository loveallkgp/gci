<p>hi everyone.I'm 19yr old.i knew I was gay from young age.i wasn't a social person at all.and by the time I was in10th I was really social, lots of friends. There was this frnd I trusted very much and I told him I was gay.he was fine with it and supported.but then he gossiped about it and told everyone. life was hell for me.then wen I joined 11th.it was new start.about 6 mnths later one of my old friends spread ithere as well.life turned hell again.this male teacher started to flirt with me and triesto seduce me.some of the other teachers are totally against me.then there's this macho clasmate who took my virginity.i love him.but its "just sex" for him.people teases me a loooot. and my family completely ignores the subject. "no comments" from them.</p>
