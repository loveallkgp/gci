<p>I have an online friend whom I like very much. I know he likes me too. But the thing is he's only stuck with friendship. Actually he's afraid of break ups. He faced so many things previously.
He never lets me in the love zone. On the contrary he chats with me whenever he gets time. He won't go offline even if he's exhausted and needs sleep until he dozes off.
For me too, I'm afraid of long distance relationship.
But it feels good talking to him. I don't show but sometimes I break down. I wish he could be mine.
We chat on WhatsApp, facebook everywhere. He cares for me like a true boyfriend. Whenever I'm sad he'd try to make me laugh. I'm so involved emotionally. What do I do now? Because I think I fell for him.</p>
<h1>GCI- Ugh, you guys should definitely talk about the thing that you have going on between the two of you. It's clearly something more than just friendship. Do not loose the time. If you do, then you are gonna regret it later.</h1>
