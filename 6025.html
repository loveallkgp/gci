<p>Hey admin I like girls only but I can't see them in sexual manner but with boys can do anything my love feelings as well as sex feelings......and this all stuff I share with my best friend and my first love i also share that I love him and wants to have sex with him ....he is just so sweet n he loves me lot as a brother...but the problem is he think m not completely turned gay as m having feelings for girls..so he just trying to cure me and I'm also thinking that i can cure myself he just taking so much efforts to cure me amd I'm also supporting because he is so caring about me and i don't want to disappoint what to do plz suggest me because I love him so much...and want todo anything for him as many people says that homosexuality is just a psychological problem so i believe .....but what should i do cause I love him and he is so supportive dont wanna loose cuse he accepted me......plz help me</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, leave that friend. He is making your life toxic. If you do want to leave him, ask him to stop with the cure thingy and accept you as it is. It is not a bloody disease or a psychological problem. That's your sexuality, whatever it is, and it's completely natural.</h1>
<p>What he is doing is not accepting your identity. He is trying to change you which is not possible. Tell him to shut his piehole and you grow some confidence. You need it!</p>
