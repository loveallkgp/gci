<p>hi all, i am 23 freshly produced engineer :-p . i am from a bustling town named Serampore ,just 20 km north from Kolkata. okay that's don't have anything with my post.
i used to call myself bisexual, as i sometime feel kinky about girls too. as i am huge in physique(height above 6 ft, waist 40inch) and my attitude is too manly so no one ever could have any doubt. on my last week of college and hostel life i came out to couple of my friends. turned out one of them is a bisexual too and have a gf and another one is straight as a pole but fucked lots of boys cause according to them it was a duty of friends with benefits. whatever i have loads of homosexual experience but not any heterosexual xp, u can say i am more inclined to boys. but according to them i should not jump to the conclusion that fast. i should take a chance with a girl and then decide in whatever way i want to lead my life. i have many female buddies, so being biased to the boys i never feel shy to talk to the girls. i once had a crush on our class topper, she was my groupmate in every lab, we befriended each other on the very first of our college and one of my closest friend. but i had never expressed my special feeling towards her, the reasons were i was afraid if it turned out to be a bad decision our friendship would go south and the second reason was if i could not be able to satisfy her physically as i am not hard straight, i am bit passive. either way i shut my feelings and let the time pass and told her everything on the day of leaving our college, turned out she probably would feel creepy about it, and we remained friend. but as i m spending lots of free and leisure time in my home as i m waiting for my joining. to kill time started cruising over fb like my old days, met some guys and screwed some too. until then it was okay as i have never given thought about gay love. but some weeks ago i exchanged number with a boy, we chatted over whatsapp for 3 or 4 days continuously and then i started to grow feelings from him. then i got panicked and shut all the contacts with him by taking his apologies. but i started missing him like hell. but tried to contact him and he again greeted me firmly. god swear i hv never thought screwing him, cz he his far divine than sex to me. but could not express myself again. i would love to spend my life just cuddling him,hold him close to my chest. but i m afraid to come out of the closet, especially now. u know i lost my mother two years ago, my father is a patient of high bp,diabetes and struck by a stroke right after my mother's demise. my married elder sister and her family is taking care of us right now. god bless them for being such helpful. they are counting on me for every step. coming out will leave them devastated. what should i do, i don't know when i have became that much love lusty.
although sorry for such a long post ;-)</p>
<h1>GCI- As you are a freshly produced engineer, what is the next step of your career? Get a job, become financially independent, get your priorities right and figure out if you want you want to settle down or not. If you want to, then with whom it should be? There is something called building towards a final goal and I think you are mature enough to talk responsibility of your own life.</h1>
