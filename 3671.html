<p>Hi admin, I'm studying in 12th class now. From my young age, I never like my school uniform. Whenever my parents put it on, I always try to remove it. I was very naughty boy. I don't remember all these, my papa told. One day, because of rain I think, clothes got wet and I did not have any inner wear. So they put the uniform on my bare body and I didn't remove it. Seeing this, they stopped putting inner wear for me and I grew up like that. Finally in 5th class, I started to wear underwear and never vest. I enjoyed that. I used to open my shirt button and feel sexy. I also get attracted to boys who doesn't wear.
This year, my papa got transfer to Chennai, here it is very hot and I sweat lot. My shirt always wet when I come from school. Many friends told to wear vest but I never like. All actors like SRK, Ranbir, Arjun are not wearing. I also feel sexy not to wear. How many of you gays are not wearing? Is it good to wear?</p>
