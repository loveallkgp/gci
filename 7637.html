<p>All through the 4 years of Engineering, this idiot tortured me. He had social anxiety. I wanted to help him. I dont know why I started loving him. He was literally a psychopath and used me totally. When I needed him he left me alone. I got along and now I dont even remember being there. Now in my work place, I again started loving this guy. He is 2 years older. I feel safe and secure when I am with him. But I dont know what to call this. I dont know if I love him or he is my friend. I dont even want to give it a name. But now this psychopath returns again and tells everyone that I loved him. That I am gay.My advice to you all is, not to fall in love with someone who has mental issues. </p>
<h1>GCI- Mental health issues have a huge spectrum. You cannot disregard everyone with mental health issues because of the behaviour of one psychopath. You too behave responsibly.</h1>
