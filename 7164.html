<p>Dear admin 
im from guwahati,Assam. There is a popular confession page of our city "guwahati metro". Gay confsns are negligbl , in two years i hv seen two three only and when i read the coments below these confesn, i was literaly shockd. There is lot more homo phobo than i than i assumd . A confesn was abt a boy coming out as a gay to his parents n the commnts were disgusting . Only a few girls n two there boys were supportive, rest were homophobic !! One coment i still remebr "why u guys are so fuckd up, u cant produce anythng by fucking each other so whats the point"
.....that coment was by a persn i knw , if a well educatd modrn 20 yr boy cant take it easily, how come i expct my parnts to take it in a normal way .
so , all i want is you to write something about how being gay is normal , you know what i mean . I tried, but my thougts and words are not as strong as yours. So please write something there , cause we have to reach the normal peopl too smile emoticon</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you can write anything on a page but it has to reach a certain amount of people. More than that, we need a more open dialogue with the masses. There is negativity about homosexuality everywhere in the world. Even in the countries where everything is legalized, there are people who still consider us as deviants, unnatural, freaks and perverts.</h1>
<p>For the older generation, their viewpoints and their mentality is kinda rigid and it's very hard to change. Also, in the society in which we are more scared about what other people might think than the what the child is going through, you cannot expect a change in mentality for the majority of cases </p>
<p>Be assured that we know that being LGBTQ+ is totally normal and natural. We do not need an assurance from anyone in the world to live. We are just as normal as anyone in the world. We have fought for our existence and visibility since more than 60 years and our identities will not be concealed by some bigoted morons who think that they can subdue us. No. Be proud of who are and be unapologetic about it.</p>
