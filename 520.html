<p>it must have been the beginning of class eight when i realized my alternate sexual identity(read GAY). i liked a guy and finally proposed to him in class 11. he said he was straight but we remained friends. until i could not take it anymore and cut him from my life. i had proposed to another guy, a doc nearly six years senior to me, bt the same fate here too
meanwhile people around me are confused about my sexuality too. some think i might be gay but maximum ppl feel i have girls drooling over me as i have a huge popularity among girls. (i have rejected a few too!).
but life cannot continue like this. i have been highly accomplished in the field of studies, with a great rank etc. and i love reading books, writing stuff etc. the problem is i wonder if i will ever meet anyone who is as cultivated as me, average looking but compassionate and honest. most importantly , he must be a guy of substance, the love of my life.
IS IT EVER POSSIBLE?
rahul, kolkata</p>
