<p>Hi GCI. Recently I have got pregnant with a new idea after watching History TV and I just want to deliver my baby in your altar. I saw how in ancient Greece in 4th Century BC they had raised a full battalion of troops made of homosexual couples/ men and transgenders known by the name of "Gangs of Thebes". They were no less fighter than the straight soldiers and are still remembered four their bravery. They fought for each other; not for religion; not for money and one day they all died fighting against the enemy to save their beloved partners and friends. If we transcend that time and arrive at this modern age we will find many countries accepting GAY soldiers (not sure about transsexuals). Keeping in view the recent Supreme Court verdict about the rights of the transgenders I am very positive that one day the Indian Army will fully accept the Gays and transgenders and give them a equal share of chance to die for their country. Hope we all make it possible in our lifetime.</p>
<h1>GCI- Put the baby back and close your legs. It needs to get mature! As far as I know, Indian army doesn't discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. There is no clause about sexual orientation in army. Homosexuals are indeed serving the country.</h1>
