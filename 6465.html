<p>Hello friends
i am praveen rai from west bengal 
22 years old" I need so suggestions from u 
I have a boyfriend who is from kerela and am a nepali guy but i dont mind whatever the caste and colour , I see  pure heart-who can be my side for forever 
the reason am confessing here is that - HERE MY STORY GOES--
I was doing my Job training in Jodhpur (Taj luxury hotel) and i never had a boyfriend in my past experience . I was mentioned as a buffet incharge ,which comes under Food and beverage department 
so i was quite serious about my carrier though still i m! And every morning i have to report  y 6am to my work plce n set everything for buffet
2 -3 months passed awys i started knowing the other deprtment people and some was very good to me ... more was chefs because we normally connects to them .... so at morning time when i go for refilling dishes on buffet i started going inside kitchen n take those wants 
everyday i used to go but i didnt notices that guy ... i usually used to talk with one chef who was incharge of that particular area... from where i take my dish but just near opposite side other indian chef used to stand... i was just lassing that way so much and one day he started joking and talking with me... calling chottu and pinching as we are good friends 
slowly this things was continuing and we became good to eachother... he was an indian meal maker chef... and one day i saw him coming to washroom where as i was just moving out .. i thought of asking him a number but not in that sense... and he also gave me his number and then that night i text him- Hi chef but no response till 2-3 days. suddenly after 3 days i got a rply back hi and hello like that we was just starting chating like where are you and how you .. in a moment he said i like u and i was shocked and said him i am a man n even u .. but i said we can be friends n even he agreed but that proposal state was on mind for that whole night and next day .. i was mad and msgd him back i like you too... because he is good man n attractive one out there... we dated for time - i invited to my room for drink but not alone with all some of my friends .. we drank Rum and felt drunk i went for a sleep even he was supposed to stay in my here 
we just layed and hugged eachother and started kissing and i dont what i did in my life... we had a sex that night</p>
<p>and my love story begins ... i was in deep love with him... we started meeting hiding un work place on free time .... in locker or somewhere else these things started so hard
and suddenly he started ignoring me not even my msg rply and attending my calls
but he was the only one who took so care of mine.. used to scold when am wrong . calling everytime caring 
but i didnt know what i did wrong he started avoiding... we had a phone fights and somany arguement regarding our relation we broked up and pachedup ... but was in love with him couldnt dream to leave him... even sometimes he calls i picked and talk on that way love u and love you too.... this things went so on n on fighting,happy , fighting
and true thing is i m in deep love with him but even he usually say me he do the same but why he is ignoring</p>
<p>that makes me crazy... n i was completed my training n got offered for job at Taj n i thot of joining there but once i need to go home after a year so i went to home ... for a month
n in my absence i heard a boy as a trainee has come(mayank) who is like us 
i heard they talked to eachother n on my vacation also he used to text me less n ignore my calls so i started doubting , i went back i meet him at hotel and then i left though that was my first day after holiday... i planned to go to my bhabhi house which is very near to his room. It was eve eving i thought of msging him ,i msged him HI "-RPLYD ME BACK-wre r u ,and i called him he said come to my room , i agreed n went off to him ... reached had a long gossip regatding my holidays ... and sooner we had sex again.. he says he loves me so much.. </p>
<p>next day i meet mayank n tried to be frank with him ,asked him to give me his phone fr takin pic's but my intension was to check his whatsaapp ... n yes i was cleared n that moment i received a right msg frm right person.. (my b0yfriend) seen i am at locker come here..n i went there snatched his phone and not returning back he was fully sad n thot of leaving that scene -not stuck with him more.. i went off givin his phone back, came home msged him for depart n he agreed 
i stopped talking to him for whole but i checked his last seen on whatsaap everytime bcz i love him so much
and after 2weeks i was standing on buffet even he was standing on dosa live making counter we didnt but i heard that his leaving this place n hotel very soon "i was sad hearing that n started searchin when he is leaving--</p>
<p>n came to know they after tomorrow is his last day on hotel.. i was like ................. totally numb statue 
and at that night i thought i should mag him for the last time n wish him a good luck fr future ,he is going dubai for next job out there ... i msgd him wished him but no rply... till that two day i m very sad he was going and with my last experience so thot of solving and ckearin everything 
next day i went to mayank n saud him frankly everything and he was being good to me ... we became good friends
and asked him to tell me everything .. n he did that
he said me evwrything ... that my boyfriend had proposed him 
i was cleares..... i called him (sreejith)-my b.f n asked him to come down for last talk n when came i said him everything he was like what ??? 
n all was true i was fooled frm so many months... n he said lets not make any scene at licker lets go smoking zone and have a talk i agreed </p>
<p>we went.. we sitted n starts talking n then laatly he conviced everything that i m correct.. he felt guilty 
i share everything how i felt and what i fewl fr him. n at last i asked him do you love me still n then he said he do still but cant forget that mayank too.... so i gv him a day fr thinking
i went to mayank and askes him - do you love sreejith he said no i dont ... he has a b.f .
he was forcing him.. so i aaked a help frm him that tell him how much i love him 
n he did that same ... he got my sreejith back 
but sad thing is he left hotel and went home till he fly to dubai.. but he had promises me he wont lie n avoid me ever how far he go.. 
but sometime same thing happens... no rply of my text n chat with mayank... </p>
<p>my boyfriend asked me fr a months to forget him but how come he will forget tell me... though they chat still
even we had a phone fight today 
he says they are just a friend but how will i believe him.. i love him so much 
i cant leave him....
i want true heart lover ... where i can settle my life with him
guys tell me m i in right position .... i wanna marry him</p>
<h1>GCI- I know that love has to be blind but why it has to be dumb too? He had sex with you, and then jumped on another guy. He said the word "love" to you when he needed sex, and you being you obliged. Just use your brain in this case and then think.</h1>
