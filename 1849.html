<p>Hi.. When I was studying engineering I used to sleep with my BF daily and we used to hug and kiss daily.. sometimes oral sex also... Other frndz say us that are u both husband and wife can't sleep separately... But nobody knows that we are gay... Now my problem is after finishing clg he didn't even care to call me... Even when I call and say I love you he's is saying I'll say when time comes.... Its really hurting for me... Wat should I do????</p>
<h1>GIC- This is what happens when your relationship solely depends upon sex. See, if  you go in a relation then do not just go into the bed and hump and see the starts in your head. Let the feelings grow first and then have sex just to feel much more closer to the soul. In your case, I think he was just using you for satisfying carnal desires(I might be wrong as you know things more). You just cannot live your life on words "I'll say when the time comes." It will not be good for your mental health and future. If he is denying you right now, who is to say he won't deny you the same in future? Get practical a bit please.</h1>
