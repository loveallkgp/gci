<p>I am aware this is going to be just like many other posts. Full of usual stuff.
But you know, there is one thing I have never been able to understand that Why I do not get the right guy. All I ask for is intellect and that's all and I wonder that is such a rare thing. Those are intellectual are mostly overconfident.
and the guys who are usually (you see, I used usually, so not all, Of course) hot screws u[ everything when they open their mouth. I tried finding people way above my age ( and let me clear this already, I am not at all saying that there is anything bad in older people), but as a teenager, it is quite a deal but then again most of them are too emotional or still working on their experimentation stage.
and Most of the time, the guy I go on a date with start losing interest after two or three meetings. I guess probably because I stress more on connecting on personal plane than going in the physical stuff.. But then, I am still not sure where I go wrong.
I am a patient listener, kind of in the intellectual category, do look fine too, probably a bit formal but I guess that's part of my upbringing... and so on (not that I am being overconfident, its just that we all have a good idea about ourselves) .. So I am not sure where do I go wrong.. !!
Any suggestions??? </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you are just another next door boy who want to feel the usual romance like going to dates, talking about each other, falling in love and then finally feeling each other as one. Most of the people are not like that. It's tough finding someone with the same frequency. But at the same time you have to keep an open mind as well. You can find love in a hopeless place and an unimaginable situation too. Just like these guys did 4 years ago.</h1>
