<p>well admin dis is specially for u since i need your views on this.</p>
<p>me and my bf we live in a small town in bhopal we both are in our 20 years of age and in final year. next year (in sum 6 months) we both are going to fall apart that means he is going to go on his own way and me on mine.... the thing is that i cant even imagine my future without him, i know somewhere he is not even bothered about this fact and he does not even care but am the only one who is putting hell lott of efforts just to be with him.... trust me it shakes my soul beneath when i think being without him and away from him.. now you gotta tell me that what should i do ? umm yes somewhere it would be very difficult for me to get settled down with him (am gonna follow HIM wherever he goes) no matter what i'll have to leave behind to be with him. please tell me if i am doing this right or wrong or how should i manage things if am planning to settle down with him ? and is it possible to do so ?</p>
<h1>GCI- And how you already know that you are gonna fall apart? Is he gonna get married? Anyway, if you keep on chasing your past, you are never gonna move on to new things. As you said that he puts no effort in the relation then having a one sided love is hardly something to keep together. And trust me you'd look like a fool if you follow him for the rest of your life. To make plans with him, he should have an equal involvement which is so not the case. So why are you day dreaming?</h1>
