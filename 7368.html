<p>I am in relationship with handsome guy since 3 months and we loved each other. We first time tried to have sex last week. However when he took off clothes he had a big scar on stomach. It seems he had appendix surgery when kid. It looks really ugly and I pretended to get urgent call from home and left. Now I am no longer attracted to him and am slowing ignoring him. Guys just be careful before you get into a relation. Even though someone may have cute face their body may be ugly. Don't get trapped me. Commit to a relation only after you have had sex.</p>
<h1>GCIL- U r kidding me...ryt?!</h1>
<p>U left a person because he had scars....
U sound so annoying and full of non growth.
Well then listen here smarty shallow pants, what will u say about the scar on the souls and they make the person ugly from the inside.....what will u do then??!
O i get it, u will say I want a clean guy from the inside as well as from the outside.....well then, goodluck for finding nobody for u.</p>
