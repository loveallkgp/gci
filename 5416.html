<p>Not a confession.. but just a different News- different from LGBT issue but almost so difficult to think of: HYDERABAD- GIRL TURNS INTO A BOY. ( This is not a Transexual thing. ) A girl studying 12th standard GIRLS COLLEGE feeling acute pain in her stomach was taken to doctor. The doctor in first test revealed that she had no womb. (sac that bears baby inside a woman). Later in further test was surprised to see that she is not a she but HE. The doctors said that due to hormones problems HIS GENITALS are HIDDEN INSIDE, which were recently taken out operation. Now HE is doing his degree as a male candidate. I am surprised how he would have felt for all these things. </p>
<h1>GCI- I still have to read more about it and then only I can understand the phenomenon.</h1>
