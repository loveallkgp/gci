<p>I am just 18 years old..and i am sure i am a gay..i know it from my childhood..
as i am attracted to boys so,just few days back ..i am in love with a guy..
i love him so much...and i told him that i like you a lot..and he too is a gay..he too wanna stay happy with me ....
But..i am quite afraid of my parents..that they wont accept us together..i just want to see my lover happy....
...</p>
<p>so i just want my parents to accept that i am a gay..but yet i haven't told that i am gay.i want to tell them but how..?</p>
<p>i want to explain my parents that i am gay..and i would love to marry a guy..to whom i love..its my choice to choose a guy.. and i am just fearing to tell them that i am a gay.</p>
<h1>GCI- Don't come out to them under pressure. A friend of mine came out at the age of 15 and suffered a lot. He is still suffering because of it but he is made up of sterner stuff.</h1>
<p>You figured it out for yourself, you are happy with it. Leave it at that. First see if you both are mature enough to handle the responsibilities of a relationship. If you do think you both are the one for each other, then take the next step after you both have secured yourself financially. If you know that your parents will not react in the positive way then you first step should always be to secure yourself. Study, make a good future and then come out. </p>
<p>Have a good future.</p>
