<p>Ola amigos.....</p>
<p>I'm from hyderabad....23,
I don't want to "come out" and never will because i think it will lead to people judging me before even knowing me and even if it isn't their business.....
It's fun staring world through as the observer than be a presenter tongue emoticon</p>
<p>I mean......are there any kickass lgbt NGOs in hyderabad?  I mean part time because I'm a student, I want to connect the Young confused souls like me and help them through their transition period and prevent suicide(I've seen one and it could have been prevented, easily, the guy just wouldn't talk about it even after I told him that I'm just like him and he needs to relax and think hard instead of taking rash decisions ....and all would eventually pass)</p>
<p>If we get 10 guys or gurls we can start an NGO on our own...because I've seen how bad the road gets for the ones who've been abused and have conflicts with sexuality,how school kids bully em and how they always fear their mum n dad or any shady character from their neighbourhood finds out and lays a shocker then sending it all into a Disarray, coming out is optional and it's nobody's business to force you to do so.....as if straight people go screaming at top of their lungs "I'm straight I'm straight I want a girl I want a boy etc"</p>
<p>Saying that....peace out brothas 
P.S. an Lgbt writers or theatre group is also on the agenda but need some real creative people who have a sense of humour.</p>
<h1>GCI- As far I remember there was a gay play called 'Hyacinth' showcased in Mumbai this month I guess and it was really remarkable in terms of its grandeur and for the NGos in Hyderabad there might be some there too. If anyone is associated as such u can join him guys!</h1>
<p>P.S- Bullies must be taught a lesson because those damaged brats sabotage others in a very self-destructive manner.
And they must not be sympathised until they change for the good. PERIOD!</p>
