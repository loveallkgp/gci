<p>I implore the confessor no 3731 to share the name,address and facebook profile of his aggressor.  We will take care of him buddy he will get such a fitting reply he will not do this again in the future. And admin do not  act the 'HIGHER POWER' here and tell us about the virtues of not having vengeance. Some people need retaliation or they will go on to become big, healthy bullies.
And yes for the people against this, I would like to say that most of you wouldn't have been bullied had someone taken a stand. This is the time to do it. Let us fightback at least ONCE. Or we will be sissies in reality apart from in straight nomenclature
Post this , for the sake of the entire LGBT community</p>
<h1>takeastand</h1>
<h1>GCI- Its only upon him to give, given that the story was true. If he does not, then we cannot do anything. Moreover I cannot post the real information of a person because of the legal defamation issue, if that happens. The other admin is still in India, you see. Also, you cannot trust the address as sometime some notorious element can give out a fake address. What you will do then?</h1>
<p>The most logical thing you can do is get in contact with the confessor personally and then do your will if he allows. His decision should be respected. He just wrote his story. he is morally weak. The best you can do is to raise his spirits up.</p>
