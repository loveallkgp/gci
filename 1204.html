o hello bhaiji fake nahi Hu..okey...
and braking bone thing ...Dracula(our frind) is against it......bt yarrr kuch tho karna pade ga he has to taught a lession... Okey not for him bt the for the girl too whoes life that bastered is going to ruin....
we r trying hard to cheer him up today in eveing v went for a movie bhootnath..it helped man my jaaneman was smiling...
last thing is there some way v could get back at him....save a innocent girl.....stop the wedding wtout outing our friend?</p>
<h1>Viv- First of all, discuss it with your friend, whatever plans you are hatching if he is comfortable with that or not. Secondly, its too good that you are standing for your buddy and at the same time you do not want a girl's life get ruined. Thirdly, what you can do is just talk with your friend's ex about whole of this matter and use a fake threat kind of thingy or make him understand the magnitude of problems he has caused or will cause in future. That guy is to be blamed but you have to take his issue into account as well about his family pressure. And as for your friend, I feel too bad for him. Give him a hug from side, would you?</h1>
