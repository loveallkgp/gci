<p>well the things start like this..i have a crush for a guy( die hard wala crush) we have been together since our 1st semester but with the different groups..we never have spoke to each other but our eyes meets too often..i am 50-50 confused about his sexual orientation.
Now we are in our second semesters and with all those guts around we sometimes share the same bench and we kind of have became friends( not that best one)..but i want him to be my closest one to whom i can call at any random hours, share a pint of beer and hangout... how can this be possible? if i approach him for this wont he will think that i am being too chipku? can this go somewhere or is it going nowhere? HELP!</p>
<h1>Viv- You were courageous enough to start friendship with him. Now sure as hell you can go from being "just" friends to best friends, can't you? If you don't want to be a chipku then don't be a wifey kind of guy. Best friendship includes masti mazak and quality time spending.</h1>
