<p>Hey.. Went through about all posts here. Going to share some thing from my bag if, admin allows
I dont want to gain sympathy but want to share..
It was the beginning of my gay life. I just came to know that i have attraction to the guys. It was my first date through the dating site. first he showed me a pic n i shared mine. we decided to come up for a meeting next day. I was shocked, that was not the guy what he showed me in pic. but still i was ok n met him casually. Things went on n on. And i came to know he told me so many fake things (As that was starting n first date so i felt weird. now i know its all normal). Still my attraction towards him was on peak. First time he kissed me, Smooched me. Daily we use to go for outing. We were caming close he was sharing his problem n personal life with me. CCD was his favorite place so daily i took him to CCD. He said he cant come out on bikes only cars he will use. I used to bring my car daily for him (mentioned because i was not mature enough that time, family dint allow me car). I was leaving my office 2 hrs early daily as he used to wait for me in evening. (not easy to leave office 2 hrs early for 2 months). Then he said he wants job in gulf as he came back to india for some reasons. he was trying hard to get jobs there but he was not getting successful due to some reasons. I had some contacts in gulf. i was trying hard to get job there for him. though we dint have anything except kissing n smooching. I am from a small city thats a well known pilgrimage. i prayed abt 25 temples for his jobs. Finally he got job in Gulf. We were so happy. i was preparing for his final day of leaving India. I spent more than lacs all my saving to get prepare him for his new jobs. dont wana go in deep what i did. Then he started telling me now i am leaving in few days now u have to come more close (for sex). I am top but i was in extreme love with him. I have surrendered myself. I said i can do only once whtever u r saying just for our love. Before that all day i went 25 temples where i prayed for him. (Still need to go Vaishnodevi, tirupati and Shirdi for him will do that some time). Now final day came. I called taxi i went Delhi Airport to drop him. On the way of airport he said i forgot to bring money that he needed to bring to exchange the currency. It was sunday anyhow i arranged that. Trying to make all incidents short. Finally he left. I was alone here. I sent him so many emails in next three days, As he dint get the phone there. Finally i got reply after three day that " i was busy in new office i m ok here". I was sending emails to him but was not getting the replies. he gave skype id. we chat some times then he stopped chatting. Excuse was "i m tired
cant type" then no phone calls, No chat, Np email. One day we talked n he cleared me that whtever u did that was not for me only your interest was also there. and finally one day he said " I M STRAIGHT" ... i was shocked ... what to reply. It took me abt 1.5 years to come out from all that crap, cried every day.. i spoiled my life, career, money... but finally came out from him...
Still two parts of my life left to share with u guys...</p>
<h1>GCI- Moral of the story- "He fucking used you for everything." And I am really sorry for that. In no world he can be straight.</h1>
