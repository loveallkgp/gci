<p>Hello Admin!....
Wassup?!.... how are you!.... :-)</p>
<p>Chal..... its time to tell about my "BITTER" experience!!.... :-(
Yes!.... my bitter experience!.....</p>
<p>This happened to me.... when i was in first year of my engg!... (now em in 2nd year :P )</p>
<p>Well..... This happened in a well reputed University in INDIA. The great VIT university!....
When i was in first year, i had a chemistry faculty..... And he is from Punjab!.. yeah... almost 70% of my class mates knew that he is a gay!.... coz... he always showed soft corner to all the boys.... and punishes only girls for no reasons!....</p>
<p>How he interuptd my life?!....
Seriously... i really had no problem with his nature towards boys!... rather i took that as an advantage to skip my assignments and stuff!...</p>
<p>One day.... he called me to his cabin along with my friend.... my very close friend since my higher secondary..... Well... we both went inside the cabin!</p>
<p>Thats not exactly a cabin..... but a complete lab is made as his cabin.... and his chair is kept inside a chamber in one corner coverd by transparent fiber glass!</p>
<p>When we entered the lab...... We saw two of our classmates standing out the fiber chamber with horror filled eyes!.... (OMG.... i still remember those cute kids eyes! :P )
Chal.... we both entered inside the chamber!...</p>
<p>Oh god! over there, sir gave us a wet smile and started to say some random shits regarding chemistry!.... and then suddenly he said, remember guys!... your internals are in my hand!...
I clearly understood what he meant.... and why are those kids standing outside!.....</p>
<p>Still.... i tried to keep my face innocent and questioned him what should we do now?!!..... then, that bloody bitch gave me a lusty smile and stood up!</p>
<p>and wishpered something on my ears!.... yes!... he wanted us (all four of us) to strip our clothes and dance in the lab.... so that he will sit and admire at us from the chamber!...</p>
<p>And added to that.... he said... in between our dance... he will come one after the other and fuck us!.... he guaranteed full internals for four of us if we obeys him!...
Oh god!.... i dont know wat i was doing.... but i ended giving him a tight slap and said
"You bloody lusty bitch!.... just stop your nonsense here!... Dont you dare to behave like this with other guys again!... or ill just post you photograph with all the shits u said to us now... in all the notice board of VIT university!"</p>
<p>Then we went out and DROPPED the course together!..... We still had problems by him!... yet we manged blackmailing him!!....</p>
<p>This is it!... so guys teme!... what should we do with such kinda faculties!?... who spoils the entire LGBT community for their lustiness!?!..... Arent they ashamed to do such kinda mean acts?!.....</p>
<p>PS.... if u gotta comment for this.... please do in English!! :P :)</p>
<p>Yours!!</p>
<h1>PP :) ;)</h1>
<h1>Viv- Chaantaa lagaaaaaa!! Amazing! One brave act done by you! Of course teacher like this should be exposed!</h1>
