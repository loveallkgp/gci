<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Was watching bigboss8 and was excited  to see Gay India 2014 Sushant Divgikar , i was feeling really very bad after seeing the feminine display of him in show. he was not wearing proper clothes, to identify him as a male.Why such gay icons potray so bad picture of gay ppl on reality shows. they themselves are making fun of themselves, and setting example  for whole country to treat them as hermophrodites or a sex object.Is money everything for ppl?
Share ur views on same.</p>
<h1>GCI- Come on! Not again. Its the fault of those who think bad and not in those who be themselves they way they want. People also condemn girls who wear short clothes, society blames the rape victims, people also say that gays are against the order of people. Now these very people cannot really accept the change from the mainstream order and leave no stone unturned to complain. Whose fault it really is then?</h1>
