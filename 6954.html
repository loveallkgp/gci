<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Well its something very disturbing I want to share. I had this friend of mine who was a very nice guy but after meeting my bf he has changed. He texts my bf and always gossips false and made up stories against me. My bf is very disturbed after hearing his set of stories and I have to face his shit as well. Am a very simple guy who had a very disturbing past and I took it all well but lately friend turning into foes is a very serious issue for a guy like me who cannot think of harming anyone. I am not saying I am a saint but if my friend had grudges against me he could have talked it out but instead he back stabbed me real bad. Is maturity that rare these days?! That friend of mine has turned a psychopath because of his past relationships I think because he was a real nice guy and now when I see him behaving this weird I guess its time for me to move on; his role in my life was upto here only I guess. And yeah I do believe that karma is gonna fuck that pig which he has become currently.</p>
<h1>Lesson learnt</h1>
<h1>Truth be told to only those who can take it.</h1>
<h1>GCI- Well as far as I can say that fucking slut needs to get trapped in an orgy and drilled hard.</h1>
<p>For you my sweetie I shall just say one thing- WAIT FOR THE KARMA TO FUCK HIM REAL BAD AND THEN CELEBRATE IN FRONT OF HIM THAT DAY!</p>
