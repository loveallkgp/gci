<p>HI Guys. I am gay and in relationship with guy from last 3 yrs. we love each other a lot.I have introduced him to my family as my gay partner. They have accepted him as my good friend.But my parents have so many desires of me to get married to a gal and have children .Being the only son, they always fear who will care for me when they are no more.Because they think gay relationships wont last long ,being not socially acceptable I am already 33 yrs. and can see lots of fear in there mind abt my future.
I am feel compltely confused
On one side i hv a loving gay partner whom i love so much and cant live without.
On other side my loving parents,whose wish is to see me married and well settled in life.I feel many a times guilty because of them.because i am source of there depression in this old age.
What all u say guys ?????</p>
<p>$ABBY : tell your parents you can't ruin life your life , a girls life , life of kids ,just because of your parents. and how can you say that a girl would stay with you forever or even live happy . do you read newspaper where its full with domestic fights and quarrels , divorces . just when your wife finds out that you were gay how would she react and the her family . they will make it hard for you to live. don't get too emotional and do what is right thing to do. you are not the only gay here ..sooner or later india is going to make gay marriage leagal .</p>
