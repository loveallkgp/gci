<p>I've got a perfect job, everything's been fine until a new person joined our company, he's not in my team, but he's on the same floor as i am... He's damn cute and looks like zayn malik... I started talking to him about this and that and i always find reasons to talk to him. I'm just crazy about him, I've also added him through a fake id and i chat on him with that. I know he is totally straight, even after knowing this thing, I'm still crazy for him. I visit Facebook thousands times a day just for him. Whenever i see him, we exchange smiles, and i also know that this is quite normal between straight guys and well... I'm quite understanding guy, but this guy is just blowing up my mind i don't know why... I just want you guys to just give me some precious comments and help me out with this situation.. I just want him to hate me, but i just can't ignore his cuteness... </p>
<h1>GCI- Damn! If he is like Zayn Malik then I don't blame ya gurl!</h1>
