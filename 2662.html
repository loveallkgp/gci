<p>well,iam new to this stuff and i dont know how to start up and what right words to use while expressing ..
iam a steady student in a usual life like others..on a fine day when i was returning frm my college i was exhausted and was day dreaming in the seat..suddenly a guy frm other college came behind me and was trying to press on me.i was always a straight in the public and turned round with angry eyes and he understood it and just backed up..</p>
<p>he was a good guy and very handsome but rather i never trusted outside beauty rather than the inner hearts..so it was the end of day one and like this just staring went on between both of us and i could see him feeling guilty as if he had done a major mistake when ever i see him he has hesitative eyes..
i am a little chatter box so,i enquired about him frm others and came to know what kind of a guy is he...
slowly i got interested in him his likes his behaviour and etc and now i think i fell for him totally ,..
he is near to my home and i love him totally
now i started to become close to him just as a friend,helping each other like the straights and i want to tell him that i love but dont know how is he gonna react or what would happen to our realtionship ...
as friend...
i never felt like this for any guy or it is just physical attraction i dont know at all,but when ever we meet in the bus i never knew how the time passed away...
i want to share ,yet dont know whether he is a straight or a gay..iam confused</p>
<h1>GCI- How can you fell in love with someone if you haven't talked with him? if we take the pressing on you account, he was trying to hit on you so that you could agree to have sex with him. If he is gay and does that then there is every chance in the world that he looks for random hook ups. Otherwise it can be just a mistake from his side. Now, nobody like him would tell his friends in locality and college about his 'secret' life. They told you stuff about him which they see and are oblivious to all that which he conceals. Choose what you want. Whether you want to approach him or not is upon you but do think practically also.</h1>
