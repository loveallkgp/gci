<p>Im 17
i met a guy from anothr country 1 mnth ago
frstly we chatted just as frns. He was also of my age. His nature was so gud, as i was serchng for a gud guy like hm so i proposed hm after sum days, he accptd.
We told evrythng 2 each othr about us n exchngd pics. He told me dat he's botm n im bot too n as i didn't wanted 2 loose hm so i told hm dat m vers
we shard evrythng 2 each othr.
i startd lovng hm too much. He gave me so many hopes about our future, our mrriage, own house, our baby. We had decided dat aftr gtting jobs n earning sum money, we'll marry n 4 dat i'll go 2 his country.
I thoght dat much time has passd n we both truly luv each othr so i shuld tell hm dat im bot. When i told hm he said dat it doesn't mattr, den i told hm dat m girly he neglcted n said dat he's sleepy. 
Nxt mrng he txted me dat we shuld stop n dat he wants a manly guy to protect him. I told hm, though m girly bt i can definitly protct hm bt he refused n blocked me. I can't frget hm ever 
Does luv dpends on being top or botm?</p>
<p>$ ABBY : darling the thing you lied to him ans disapponted him. you can't judge people for what they want . they have feelings too , some expectations from life .. if he wants a manly top let him have a manly top.</p>
