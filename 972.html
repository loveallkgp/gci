<p>I am 20 from Mumbai, learning final year political science!!
Many of people who are openly campaigning about some political party on this page cached attention of political scientist in me.(Supporting any party is completely fine in democracy but electorate first should be well informed)
Most of LGBTQ electorate in India (1 percent of population) is not at all aware about the complications associated with sec 377 and gay rights situation in India and they are just going with flow,supporting some party. First of all whole community should learn to be pragmatic. Amending penal code require majority in parliament and going against or hating any major party will expand the present divide between politicians and gay community.
I think the solution is LGBTQ activists should now assume role of leaders and start nation wide negotiations with every political party. Just go and meet the leaders of those party try to explain them your position,start pushing agenda(lobbying) don't hate or don't depend on any single party so we will get maximum votes for our amendment to IPC , but scrapping sec 377 is just not enough. Drafting law which recognizes our relations on government documents , courts is also important
PS: sorry to bore you people. will send more confessions like this if get good comments</p>

<h1>Viv-  There is one way. To write the elected parliament member of your city/state concerning about your issues and making then aware of the whole scenarios. But at the end it all comes down to what the leader of the party says. No party member can do anything if the decision of the party leader is final.</h1>
