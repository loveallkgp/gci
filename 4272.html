<p>hii I am 21 . my life has become hell complicated.
I am using this fake fb account frm last two years. I got many proposal fr relationship due to my looks n nature.. but I dint accepted because I dint had any feelings.</p>
<p>now before couple of months approx last march I got one guy here.. v had chats , talks etc.. he ws approx 500 km away frm my city...and I felt like I am in love wid him.. it ws first time I felt for any one. now situation ws like he is going Australia next week for his studies .</p>
<p>we met twice only..once in Aug and second time yestrday and today.. he had came to meet me because he is going there.. He also has feelings for me. but he is scared as its not possible for us to live together. .</p>
<p>I said my family that I will go Australia but they are not allowing me.. and my parents are just 7th pass they even don't knw wt is homosexuality and etc ??</p>
<p>I am feeling mch alone.. I don't knw wt to do? neither I can stop myself from loving him nor my parents are allowing me to go there.. and he has paid fees and all even he cant stay here nw..</p>
<p>I don't knw wt to do ? I can't stop myself frm loving him.. he came day before yesterday in my city.. v were together for 3 days.. today when he went we both were crying on road..and on bus stop. we both knew v might nt hug each oder nw .he is in same situation there.. what we shud do ? even I don't have such huge amount that I can run away frm herr n go Australia .. nor does he have . </p>
<h1>GCI- Umm if you really love each other then you should work yourself into moving to australia at a later stage. It can take 3-4 years but it can happen. Nothing is impossible.</h1>
