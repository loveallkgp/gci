<p>If i ever fall in love again it will be with a person who will accept me the way i am, all my flaws and my nature. I am not a kind of person who express my emotions easily i cant be on the phone everyday telling my boyfriend how much i love him because thats not me if the guy needs some one who give him all that attention and bring him flowers etc then i guess i cant be the one for him. Having said that it dose not mean i don't know how to be romantic, he might be thinking that i am the most un romantic person in the world but i will secretly be planning on taking him to most romantic secluded resort in Bali or shopping secretly at tiffany for that perfect ring. But the relationship mostly falls apart before he really gets to know the real me coz i'm not giving him much attention. I don't understand why its so important to txt and call each other everyday to prove that you love that person. I am bit of a loner i rather be alone and watch a documentary on youtube rather then spend an hour on a phone with a friend or boyfriend. </p>
<p>I like some one but i think its about to fall apart again and its all because he feels that i am not giving him the attention. I don't know what to do, i know i cant change myself, i can't be on the phone all the time doing all sonu, monu, mera shona, mera baby etc ... i can never do that its just not me. I need someone who love's me without any expectations and also you can only talk/discuss things over the phone somuch, after a time you run out of things to talk. But i don't know if i am being realistic. What are your thoughts admin? I like this guy, i don't want to loose him but I'm also not willing to change the way i am.
P.S - We are in long distance relationship and i hate phones and emails. i am more of a face to face person. Thanks in advance for you advice</p>
