<p>Hello guys,
I'm a 19year old medical student.
I wanna tell u one thing. Since from 2years i'm here in this gay world. But still i didn't got my real love. 
I've seen lots of man From here are sex seeker n lots of are fluctuating with there decision.
I want a real guy who is fair,well built up,good at humors,honest,charming,loyal,not be so diplomatic,not a sex seeker,don't be confused for his decisions,a mature guy.
Well i know this kind of act is so silly but i don't know why i'm still going to do that.
Although i did not have done any confession like that.
This is my second time i'm confessing.
Guys plz be humble n little bit serious for what i've asked from you.
Well secondary i want to appreciate both of the admins(viv &amp; abbi) for helping ppls n giving them good ideas for their problems.
I love abbi for his innovative ideas.
U are also very good in that @ viv.
:)
:)
:)MAY GOD BLESS U all.
Aur bhagwan kare gay marriage legal ho jaye Delhi(INDIA) M.
Guys plz pray for this.</p>
<h1>JAMES CYRUS.</h1>
<p>$ABBY : oh boy ..... first take a look in mirror and see if you have the qualities you are demanding ... if you have you will get the one with same ... outlooks . and about mature guy thing .... i think a mature person will demand a mature person to really settle down with . nobody is going to settle down with 19 years old guy who is still living with his parents . find me rude but i was true with what i think . </p>
<p>anyhow thanks from both of us admins .. and yepp its going to happen soon .. we gays will get married</p>
