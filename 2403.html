<p>My love story in my self written poem form titled ' You will come to know' ... </p>
<p>days, and now months have gone by, 
All that i still do is lie. 
I lie that i don't love anyone, 
but the truth is that i do love someone. 
I lie that there is no person i care about, 
but there is someone for whom i cry my eyes out. 
I say that we are just friends , but that's a lie too, 
i love u too much but don't know what to do! 
I love you, can't you understand that by looking into my eyes, 
can't you distinguish the truth from my lies! 
I never told you about my feelings, not beacause i'm weak, 
I am just afraid of the words you may speak to me. 
I'm afraid that you would say that you dislike me, 
I'm afraid that you would say that you hate me and never liked me. I know i'm not good enough for you, 
but i can always wish for you. 
when you are happy , I find myself in a paradise, 
your sadness makes me feel the darkness just before sunrise. 
One day, you will come to know that i love you, 
that the most precious thing in my life were you. 
I don't know when will that day come, 
what that ordinary day would become. 
But i know that the day would arrive too, 
As i would have , by then accepted my fate. 
I will ne very far away , 
I won't be with you that day. 
It's for you whom i crave, 
but alas! when you will come to know , I would be in my grave.
 when you come to know , don't blame yourself for my death, 
Just remember that i Loved you till my last breath.</p>
