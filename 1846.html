<p>Hi guys.. This is not a confession. It was about year ago that i was going back home Nepal from London to attend my sister's wedding reception and i found a guy in a plane who was from Dubai going his country back too.. That guy was sitting before my sit with his friend but later he left his friend and came to my me and asked whether he could sit  with me? I said OK coz the sit next to mine was vacant so.. His looks was normal not kinda gay looks.. Somtime we talked also but not regarly coz he was stranger to me. He kept asking me hw im doing in London kinda questions and i also asked him bUt he said he came to visit. He was a cool guy. He also insist me to drink tea after our meal like we knw fr each other sice very long. anywaz.. All i can say that i miss him all of sudden today.</p>
