<p>i think commiting suicide is not a act of cowardice. you can't control where do you want to get birth but you can surely control how and when do you want to die. accordibg to my thinking, this option of voluntarily ending your life is not a sin but it's opportunity given to us by god to leave material world if you feel that you can't survive there anymore and go and live with god , in his kingdom. that's why according to me suicide is not a sin but it's some option provided to you when you came into this world and now it's my time to use it... i want to leave this world and want to be his devotee forever residing in his mighty kingdom. this world has just hurt me mentally and physically and made my life a living hell and i must end it here because i want to go there.</p>
<h1>GCI- Please do not encourage people to suicide. You might be right in your logic but it can have terrible effects on other people. Freedom of speech is okay but as long as it harms others, you should contain it in yourself.</h1>
