<p>Regarding the acceptance of LGBT in society:</p>
<p>I'm a gay and i myself think that if we are accepted, we would fuck with everybody we'd like to and fuck up with peace of this society.. what we people do is sleeping with many and end up feeling lone.. the way many of us feel now, with so much trust issues and in our solitude of grief.. we would do the same if we would be accepted but the big question is.. wouldn't the people have done the same several years ago, at the beginning of civilizations? they definitely would have, or else how would they know that this is good and that is bad.. they committed mistakes, they learned, they got saturated once and now are evolving again..</p>
<p>If we are given a chance, we would also make mistakes/crimes and will learn. Although, in the present scenario the probability is far less owing to the education we've got, but still there would be many problems if we are accepted.. but again, it's about the human rights..</p>
<p>All i wanted to say is that we LGBT need to be accepted FULLY not partially, coz that would not just make us feel hatred towards society but will also create a chaos in OUR peaceful society..!!</p>

<h1>GCI- I don't think that it is a part of sexuality that fucks up the peace of the society. The thing that fucks up the peace of the society is the consumerist mindset. Everyone gets so busy in the lives, that they hardly pay any attention to minute things. When people go emotionless, heartless, when they want to just earn, have fun and not live, that fucks up the peace of the society. All these things are found in the heterosexual community also.</h1>
