<p>hey am 19 bisexual from Hyderabad .....
I have a habit of masturbating regularly
I think because of dat my face is getting spoiled .....
nw I have many pimples on my face
so what I wanna ask you is
do anyone have a habit of dng dis n have an idea to control pimples
tell me a way through wich I can masturbate without pimples</p>
<h1>GCI- Acne doesn't depends upon masturbation. Its is related to the hormonal changes in your body. The age of 19 years is normal to have acne. I went through the worst acne condition during the time between 18 years to 21 years. I did many treatments, like ayurved, I went to dermatologist, used many creams, swallowed pills, washed my face with medicated soap but nothing worked. When I reached a certain age, it all stopped. And now my skin is clear. Your body is still having some changes and hence you are having acne. Just don't do anything rash with them. Wash your face regularly like once every 3 hours and let your skin be dry. Don't let it get too oily or apply any creams on it. Sometimes the blockage of pores also result in acne.</h1>
