<p>I think its stupid but I'm gonna ask you anyway. I have this friend who basically told me two days ago that he has indulged in sexual activities with boys many times. He says that he has even had sex with guys. Then he says that he stopped and has not done anything of the sorts for 2 years now. However he hasn't stopped having sex with girls. So he says that he's not bisexual since he hasn't "touched a dick" in over 2 years and he blames his past activities on his rampaging hormones. He's adamant at not calling himself bisexual. My question to you here is that can he really blame it on the hormones? Can a straight guy really have sex multiple times with guys and give blowjobs and stuff multiple times and still be really called straight with the explanation being that his hormones couldn't stop his dick from popping out of his zipper? Or is he just a whore? I have my answers but what are your thoughts?</p>
<h1>GCI- Yeah some guys do blame it on rampaging hormones to fuck anything that walks with a hole. Its debatable that whether guys like your friend are straight or not. Some supposedly straight guys do have sex with other guys but then they leave it all and get settled with a girl. Some continue to have it but as they say that they don't take it up in the ass so they are not gay. Maybe its the denial that they live in but they definitely can't be called straights.</h1>
