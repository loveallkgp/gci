<p>Hi...m 26 ...average looking guy ..educated {completed mbbs},emotionally very unstable I always fell in love wid my st8 friends...In past I hv very bad experience wid a guy who was st8 n in first look I feel in love wid him,den v wer together for 3 years in dat duration he used me in every possible way ....mainly economically....dat was worst phase of my life...den 2 year b4 I moved away wid a very bad ending....now I am in love wid one of my workmate who is very close to me...no wow I am in big bizarre why I always fall in love wid st8 guys....m in relationship wid a gay guy too he is very dashing n good looking. ..but I never feel anything about him and never had sex wid that gay guy ...I am in relationship wid dat gay guy just bcoz I don't want to c him sad n depressed. ..Once I tried breakup wid him but he was next to death after that ...then again I accept him...what should I do because it's impossible for me to love any other guy about who me I know his sexual orientation. ..I m in love wid my day workmate....how to fix my life...any suggestions friends n admin.</p>
<h1>GCI- MBBS and unstable....isn't that oxymoronic on the professional part?!</h1>
<p>U got used for fucking 3 years only....Pity on the guy for making it so short....The way u are saying about urself, anyone can use u for a lifetime. Listen U like strt or gay doesn't matter but it matters on the front of having a stable relationship and it does make a difference on our psyche if we are not able to take stands and find solutions of our misery. 
U mustn't have 'piteous' love for someone..No one deserves that....not even u! 
If u need to work out on things then work on 4 things mainly-
1- See what makes u unstable.
2- Learn to accept ur flaws and work on them with a good pace.
3- Underline ur strengths as a person and enhance them with a new pattern of redefined thinking.
4- Find answers from your understanding that where are u stuck in terms of emotional intelligence, sexuality, undermined patriarchal psyche-belt, and lastly the reason for you being a drag for yourself.</p>
