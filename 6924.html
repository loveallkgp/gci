<p>my direct questin to you...mr.admn..as a prsn asociatd wit lgbtq etc or being a homo..have u evr faced bullyin or homophobia..? if so wat was ur replay..or hw did u copeup wit dat situ..? replay must</p>
<h1>GCI- Well yes I was bullied, physically beaten and whole other things happened with me. I found courage, acceptance and the ability to fight back much later in life. That was an acquired quality for me, something that I was never taught by my parents. I wasn't able to cope up with it much. That's why for the most part of my childhood I was in depression, but never did I try to take away my life.</h1>
<p>All these experiences in my adolescent age put me in a dark phase of denial. I accepted myself and my identity approximately 3 years ago when I came on this virtual world with a profile with fake name. I educated myself, interacted with people and became more open about my identity. That was the moment when I found my courage and confidence and my nature to not take shit from anyone.</p>
