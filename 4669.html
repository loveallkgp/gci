<p>When I was 12 years old, I was fascinated with Indian rich culture and diversity. I was very much aware of Indian history and civilization. The gayness in me insists that I should meet Indians. From then on, I dreamed of going to India at all costs.</p>
<p>I applied for a scholarship and was accepted to study. I finally realized that I really need an Indian to be my lover. Yes, I am certain with that, I want to have an Indian partner.</p>
<p>I am 36 years old Filipino who traveled many times to India in search for someone who could love me back and fight for our relationship. Some of them are not strong enough to tell to their parents and ended up with arranged marriages with girls. That's pathetic and here they are communicating with me.</p>
<p>I am still looking forward with the possibilities of getting one not just for the sake of getting it but to be committed and live a happy life with someone I deserve. Is there anyone strong enough? Let's see. </p>
<h1>GCI- Umm, if you meet someone or text someone who you start to like, just ask one question, "Will you tell about your sexuality to your parents when the time comes?" If he says yes, then you can think about the possibility. If not, then you can bid him goodbye.</h1>
