<p>my x bf said to me that i should get married to a girl and that he had already decided to get married after 25 and i thought to myself how can i love the guy who is saying that he is gona get married as if he is giving an expiry date. after that date our relation would get over how could i fall in love.
u only suggest me did i do the right thing by breaking up now only or no bcoz if i really fell for him and he would leave me how could i get over him.
im feeling guilty please tell me did i do the right thing or no</p>
<h1>GCI- Of course you did the right thing. Why deliberately hurt yourself when you know yo have no future together?</h1>
<p>I had a contact with this guy who was very sweet and super close to his family. We talked for a few days and then I asked, "What are your future plans?" 
He replied, "I will get married to a girl." 
I was shocked but I asked him, "Have a hypothetical situation that you got a boy whom you love and he is like the love of your life, will you still get married to a girl?" 
He replied, "I will tell him before that in the end I will settle with a girl. He will be my friend for life and I will love him but I can't cross my family."</p>
<p>And I thought to myself, "What a freaking puppet!" After that I didn't contact him.</p>
