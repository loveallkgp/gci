<p>After reading all ur confessions I thought I should confess which I never did to anybody. Best friend turned into Crush.. Basically I m type of person who do not go for apologies even the mistake is mine. I never went to apologise for being rude. 1 month I fought with my best friend (which is actually my crush but I never let him know) . we use to sleep together shirtless. I don't know what is in his mind but I do it intentionally bcz it makes me feel like heaven. so back to the track I do apologise with anybody I decided I m not going to be the first for making apology n He also that kinda of person who don't let down himself anybody. passed 1 week neither I went to him nor he came to me but belive me that was the hardest time I ever had. but then I decided to go for apology for the first time forever. n he accepted in fraction like he was also waiting for me. but the problem is we r not longer same as we were before fighting. I want to do all what we did (shirtless sleeping with him). We behaves like we r stranger so pls let me know what should I do to get him back. note: He don't know that I do have feelings for man. I m straight for him.</p>
