<p>Hey admin how's uh???
Need ur suggestion why I'm not getting the same feeling with my present bf jaisa mujhe x bf se feeling aata tha I love him a lott par pata nahi kyu wo feeling nahi aata hai.....!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Urgggghhhhh!!!Not the same ex cases again..ok now hear and hear tyt-</h1>
<p>1- EX or ur frst love stay in our minds subconsciously and affect our moods and emotions in the long run.
2- If ur frst love is ur ex then it has many set standards which are not easy to get over with...for e,g- WE start comparing our ex with our present bf which ultimately leads to a very common situation..SEPERATION..and the reason is quite obvious- WE are not treating our present with the dignity of being our partner and are actually doing injustice to their love.
3- Never think that ur present will love u in the same way ur ex loved u..IF THAT HAD BEEN SO U WOULD HAVE NOT SEPERATED...and would not have been with ur present guy..
4- Ur present partner has a definite persona and different mindset..if u cant understand the basic fact that INDIVIDUALITY matters in love too..then my dear u r still stuck with ur past and ur guy actually dont belong in ur present..u r just doing plain grave injustice to ur relationship.
5- My friend suffered the same thing but she decided not to compare his present love with his ex and then she realized that how wrong was she in expecting the same kind of love which she got from her ex.
6- DONT ever think that ur present bf will achieve ur set standards of ur ex or ur frst love bcoz that is impossible and plain STUPID..y???? bcoz LOVE MAKES NEWS PARAMETERS WITH NEW PEOPLE..AND old bridges are burnt down so that we never go back there!</p>
