<p>Do straight guys can enjoy getting sucked by a male??
I want opinion of urs as I'm 25 years and in sort of relationship with a straight guy from last 5 years. He enjoys a lot getting sucked by me. But he never ever does anals with me and is fine with bodyplay, lot of smooches and loves while I bite his nipples.
I feel lack of feelings from his side as he never initiates for fun and I'm the one who is active on bed and doing the part. After cumming he gets dressed very fast and avoid making eye contact with me. He never cares about my orgasm. I've confessed my feelings for him several times but he doesn't even utter a word. We're friends but we've never talked about this. Sometimes I feel that nothing had happened between us. I want to get out of this dilemma. I know he'll get married, but I want physical relations with him after that too and if he is just enjoying I wanna get out of this now. Readers I need ur advices.</p>
<h1>GCI- Make a strong mind and don't get on your knees for him. It's messing up your brain. You have feelings for him that he doesn't care about and he doesn't care about your sexual needs too. Do you need anymore reasons to get your head on track? If you care about ruining your friendship, don't worry honey, it's already ruined.</h1>
