<p>Hi admin... i m making this confession after 2 long years i guess.. for 2.5 years i was in relationship with a russian and was living with him only. In march we broke up. I left the place and a week after it he found someone else.. i tried killing myself but failed. Donno how love just faded away in 1 week.. what shall i do? I dont have a path. Ppl say to move on. But how to move on i donno. Yeah i started making new friends. But whenever i write to them i feel guilty... and from last 1 month i am attracted to a straight friend of mine. It all started one day when we were drunk and kissed me on my lips ... he said it was just a joke but that kiss gave me a spark.. he has a gf. And i cand decide what to do.. help me out</p>
<h1>GCI- You are in a vulnerable position right now. You are on the lookout for you ex-equivalent. Stop it right now. Being friends with other people and having guilt about it, should be the last thing you should think. You need to socialize, you need to have some conversation with people to let your melancholia out. Otherwise you are just going to have suicidal thoughts over and over again. No life is worth of suicide. YOU CANNOT END YOUR LIFE just because your ex found a new guy right after 1 week of breaking up with you.</h1>
<p>You need friends right now, and not a relation. Take a year away from feelings, get over your ex, enjoy your life and then start looking for someone. If you get someone new, he would just be a rebound and you'd not want to hurt anybody else. And for God's sake, get out of Russia if you are living there. that country is not good for LGBT people at all. It's a horrible place to live in.</p>
