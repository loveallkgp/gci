<p>dear I m bisexual man, mostly I see in man 2 man relation every one is try to increase his counting to do sex with no of people. mostly people do one time sex with some one try to ignore him or finding another new why?</p>
<p>$ABBY : see sex happens with mutual understanding . and if someone wants relation why would they sleep in bed on first date. why didn't they clear it up before to each other about their priorities. not everybody wants to get in relationship with whom they have had sex .
 i think people are themselves very confused because first they want just sex but eventually when for sex they get a very handsome man they ask for ' relationship ' but that other guy didn't came for relationship right . hope you are getting it . people these days are very clever and they know how to fool around and act like victims..</p>
