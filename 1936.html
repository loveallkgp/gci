<p>My parents come from a traditional, cultural and religious family. According to their belief, being gay is very wrong. This is not just about my parents, my entire clan has the same mindset. For my parents family honor, society honor and 'ghar ki izzat' is very important. They are very much obsessed with name, fame and honor. They can do anything to get it.</p>
<p>May 31, 2014. I will never forget this date. With the help of my brother, my sexuality was discovered by them. My life is soon to become a big hell.</p>
<p>After the exposure of the truth my parents are intending to stop my education, remove the internet connection, confiscate communication devices, restrict my freedom, cut my contacts with LGBT people and marry me to a girl.</p>
<p>They are thinking I have 'become' gay due to higher education. So they have decided to stop my education.</p>
<p>They are thinking that I was always straight but have 'become' gay after my interaction with LGBT people. So they've decided to cut all my contacts with LGBT people. Not only this, they're also going to complain to cyber police and take actions against those LGBT people, just because of their sexuality and the communication between them and I. They may also restrict my freedom, confiscate my mobile phone and remove the internet connection so that I could never meet them.</p>
<p>Also they're planning to get me married to a girl forcefully next year. I am only 18 years old. The minimum age for marrying in India for men is 21, but they want me forcefully to get married at 19. I have also told them that it's wrong, but to no avail. According to their belief, there is no minimum age for marriage, but there's a minimum age for it's consummation.</p>
<p>They think by being gay I am bringing shame to the family and now they want that so-called 'izzat' back. They believe by doing such things will not only 'cure' my homosexuality but also 'strike me out' of homosexuality forever.</p>
<p>I have also told them that being gay is natural, OK and not chosen. But they were stubborn in their own homophobic views. I don't know in what way I should explain it to them.</p>
<p>Though I am 18, but I come from such a family that I am a lifetime slave to them. I always have to give the record of my daily activities to my parents. I can't do anything without their will. Even if I have freedom, I have to depend on then and be under their feet.</p>
<p>I am now worrying about my future. I am sure, my future is gonna going to be shattered when in my family I have a father who is very Hitler-ish, a mother who is very anti-gay and a brother who acts as a fuel to the fire and makes the situation worse. He is also teaching my another brother to do the same what he does to me.</p>
<p>Hope everything goes fine by time, otherwise I am gone forever.</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh My God! Honestly brother just lie low. Fake a situation and say "Don't get me married too early. I will do whatever you want. But let me get a job first." Whenever you get a job, just move the hell away from your house and never look back. And be safe in this time.</h1>
