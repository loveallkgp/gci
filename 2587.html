<li>India. Gay (just felt like mentioning :) )</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to mention something about my life here.
I've actually read many guys saying how much they love their straight best friend and how much in trouble they are over not being able to tell them. My sympathies are with them :)
Talking about me, its little different. I have a best friend. Not very much attractive but still he is good. Best part is he's a wonderful person :) . So, I told him I was gay. He's Straight as pole, of course :3 And, he was sorta okay with that. I mean to him, it'd be best if I was into gals (He's Very perverted, btw -<em>- ) but still its okay with him.
I'm better than average in Looks (People say this :P ;) ghamand nahi hai ..main toh bas truth bolta hoon <em>puppy face</em> ) Many people even look at me with THAT look while walking on the street u know...I can surely say if they are gay (or at least bi )..sparkle in the eyes dude ;) .
Anyways, coming to my friend, The thing here is that sometimes he hints me to suck him -</em>- yes you heard it right. That perverted little bastard asks me to suck him..hehe..only to get a kick from me and couple of swearings :3 All I say to him is "I'll suck your nasty,filthy dick in your dreams buddy"
He's like Brother to me :) can't ever think of him the other way. But the little bastard never leaves a single moment to tease me..hehe..and I love him for the way he is. :D
All I wanna say here is I feel damn lucky to have a best friend like him. :) thankfully I dont have any crush on my straight best friend. and for those who do.. All the best :D and hopefully your 'dream' comes true ;) XX</p>
<h1>GCI- Haah! Straights and their shenanigans with their gay friends... XD</h1>
