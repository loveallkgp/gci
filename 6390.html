<p>Hey All
So good to see this Awesome Page after a long time :) missed u admins
So i m 20 yrs old n i m not dt much attractive, So obviously i m alone and single.n i met this guy last week after chatting n calling fr 9 months at his room. Though i though we r going to have sex date but surprisingly he treated me like a very gud friend at first meeting itself , he was so kind hearted! We cuddle, kissed romance fr a very long time but did nt remove our undies :D . no one treated me lyk this before :) he treated me in a very gud way vrry very cute way! he said there z right time of everything but he do sex dates frequently its visible by his PR id :) .or i m thinking too much may be he finds me ugly dts y did nt do n he is nice person so did kiss n oll jst bcz i dont feel bad?? May be? He olso said he is bored of sex now wants something stable . But he texted me thik se pahuch gye i replief ya. afte that no conversations b/w us happened! so it means he is not interested?? he is so gud by nature that despite of his avg looking he has frnd wd many hotties there z something in him. Should i text him? or should be in my limits :( . he treated me wd so much love n care i wont frgt ever in my lyf :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Don't get head over heels like that all of a sudden. Rather I'd say go with the flow. Be his friend, go out, have conversations, spend some time, see where it goes and see what he wants. You will figure out how to act. To be honest, I have seen a pattern in guys like these. They meet new guys, talk nicely with them, spend quality time, treat you like you are the only one who matter for them, and then they will move on to someone else. They have like an army of sycophants following them. Not true for everyone but this is what I have observed. So be careful and don't get sad if he doesn't pay much attention to you after.</h1>
