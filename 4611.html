<p>Thad day hascome Admin, today is his wedding day. From today onwards, he is officially belonging to some one else :) :)</p>
<p>good old days when i used to ring him from sitting in another hostel,
the money which I took from his pocket and purse
The ice cream scoups which I have taken from his cup,
He like vanila though :)</p>
<p>The badam milk, which i was loving to get a sip from his salivated bottle,
the Cafeteria, the corridor, the blue shirt :)
The end of everything, I need to accept this, no other go :)
What else can I do, What else can I Do ?</p>
<p>When my heart and soul is being taken away from me ?! :)
Long live for years to come honey,
I will be waiting in front of St.Peter's Gate, silently,
I wish I could join you in your next birth , atleast,</p>
<p>Eagerly waiting to see your Bride groom costume,
The stupid mind of mine, will look for your joy alone :)
Good luck my man, will be loving you, no, no,.
Qill be loving you both, always. Take care of you :)</p>
<p>You will be missed and remembered 
The swetest part of my life, a beautiful faily tale,
One long beautiful dream has come to an end today :)
10.12.2014- His wedding day.</p>
<p>What else i can say :) peace :)</p>
