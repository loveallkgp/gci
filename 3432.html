<p>Dont read this if u hate dramas or consider dramatic confessions as fake</p>
<p>i am 18yr old guy,m quite nerdy i can say, well i was sitting at the window seat in a train...it was quite empty...i had headphones plugged in and almost sleepy when train stopped at a platform and hot+cute guy got in and sat in front of me ...he was also almost the same age as mine...he too had his earphones plugged and was staring outside the window enjoying the typical music+windowSeat wala feel :p...that sight when soft breezes were making his sliky brownish hairs dance uff...such dramatically beautiful scene it was...suddenly my stomach growled :/ so i removed my bunch of Snickers from my bag nd then i noticed him watching me...suddenly he asked if he can hve one from my lot of Snickers and smiled so cutely <em>_</em> and i was like huh? and blushingly he said he'll pay 5rs extra (lol....)
i was like Okay(trying not show my excitement or blush)... and gave him one, he immediately handed me rs.20 i was too embarrassed! thank god there were only 4 ppl at that time in our compartment that too seated afar...
i said no its ok (blushingly:) ) bt he insisted much...and thats where we struck a conversation about college and all....
never imagined such a hot guy wud me my instant friend i hope he must be gay nd meet me once again....
bt my badluck as i hardly travel through that train :(...</p>
<h1>hope to get more such experiences ;)</h1>
