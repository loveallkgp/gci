Dunno whats dat thing keeping me to still remember him.. Was i wrong? What shud i do?</p>
<h1>GCI- Loyalty oh loyalty, wherefore art thou loyalty? Over here the mistake was of your so called bf only. You wanted to do something else but you didn't. That's your karma. Had you continued it, we would have been having a different conversation.</h1>
