<p>i'm 20 yrs old studying in engg colleg. Since childhood i have been crossdressing, i like to crossdress, it makes me feel happy and beautiful, i've two girl-friends who know about me, and i talk like a girl with them, i discuss about guys, dresses, gossips etc etc. I never thought i was gay, but the idea of being a girl, having long hair, wearing dresses etc turned me on. Whenever i used to fantasize or watch porn while wanking i used to imagine my self as a girl, sometimes making love with men, sometimes with women , and sometimes i just used to imagine that i was a girl , and doing normal things like watching tv, or being with friends etc.
Now about the real life. I am not sad about me being a boy, I'm totally comfortable in my skin. I am definitely attracted to females by looks and emotionally, I feel sad, happy, attached , lonely etc for girls. But when i don't see myself being the 'guy' in sex. I never think about even touching private parts of girls while wanking, rather i think about private parts of guys. I don't feel attracted or attached towards a guy, guys never turn my neck while walking on the road but girls do. but i do fantasize about making out with guys, and about cocks etc. 'This sunday out of curosity I even gave a blowjob to a boy (first sexual experience with any gender)!!! :O I kinda liked it , and would do it again.' i've thinking about it, and wanking about it . But i'm still not attracted towards guys, and generally don't feel any sexual or physical desires while hanging out with guys.
Idk I'm very confused and tensed about my future.
Is this the 'porn-effect'? i love watching gay ,cross dreesser. sissy, cuckold porn etc
Or the fact that making out with guys makes me feel more feminine turns me on, as behaving and dressing girly turns me on and i like that feeling.
I need to know what am I?Why do i think about sexual make outs with guys? Why do i think about cocks? when i have no interest in having a relationship with males or having a male as my life partner Are there more like me?
P.S- Dream Arrangement for me- I get a girl who has no problem with all these things, she lets me crossdress , or may be take hormones, and we love and support each other deeply. But for sex we do with other man/men!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe you are still the phase of getting to know yourself. Even I like girls emotionally but I can't dream of getting in a relationship with one. At one point you said you dream about private parts of guys and even gave a BJ to one but then later you said that you don't feel any physical or sexual desires about guys you are with. Well its kinda my case also. If I am with my guy friends, I don't think about removing their pants and getting kinky with them, no. But I am still gay. It would be better that you clearly think about what you want and what you do not want. That is something you will learn with experience and maturity and not by just assumptions.</h1>
