<p>Hello friends...
So it goes like... I was once talking over my phone to my boyfriend.... nd my sister saw me...
She would be like asking all the time who it was... So initially I just lied to her..... But later she found out that it was a lie.... nd I confessed to her.... that to over facebook.... I showed her my boyfriends profile...
She was like... Yeah I will support you... We are family....
But again next day she was like..... Why don't you try to make a girlfriend.... Bla bla bla... all kind of bullshits.... Damn I have a boyfriend... How can I date someone else... I have a boyfriend.. (## Whom I have never met... Long distance relationship that too through facebook... Damn)
But yeah I love him.... So when I go home this time.... My sister will ask me all kind of questions and I have to answer her... How do I make her understand her that being gay is natural....
By the way I am just 21 and my boyfriend is also 21.... Purrhhhh..!! I am confused...!! DAMN </p>
<h1>GCI- You have to talk with her. Do that calmly and give her time to accept it. For the people who are all new to this, you cannot expect them to understand in a matter of a few hours. You have to give them some time. In the meantime have a positive attitude.</h1>
