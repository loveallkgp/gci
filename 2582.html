<p>i had one of my senior in my college 3rd year he had some back subjects so he usd to come attend in my class... he usually see towards me.. i didnt hav any introduction with him.. one day i got a call from him.. i surprisded that how this person got my no?? he had just excuses to talk with me as was asking about time table for nextday he had taken my no from my close friend. then after he used to take my practical files and notes..and build friendship with me... then during exams.. i was strong in some subjects so i was teaching to my friends he also desired to join us and i used to teach him these subjects personally i also gavemy exam materials and also issued boooks from library for him.. and before the day of exam paper at night i got his call.. he was asking about the doubts he was facing... but it was just his excuse..he just wanted to talk with me. anyhow he was telling problem numbers and i was explaining the solutions for it.. and suddenly..he told me.."I Love You".!!!!!!!! i couldnt react for a while what to say..how to react.. it was a complete sillence for 2 minuites i think he also realized what a serious matter he has told.. but then i convertred the matter in light mood.. and finished the talk as soon as possible. during the night i got this words in my mind many times.. and i think he too... then next day he was hiding himself coming in front of me and me too was doing the same.. after that month result got announced he cleared the subject and went away... then after he used to send me lovely messages from different different numbers but i got the clue that who wouldbe.. then time has passed.. and i too hav completed... migrated for my masters...changed mobile numbers and now we r no more in contacts. but still even today........ he is in my heart i cant forget the lovely experience i felt amazed.. i got the meaning of love on which i was laughing..as never believed in love but me realized and felt it dont know..what was God's wish...!!! this is my never beginnned...early ended lovestory..!!! Friends, CAN I GET HIM BACK...IF SO THEN HOW...(Just pls don't suggest me to confess before Him..!!)</p>
