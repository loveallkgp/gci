<h1>Viv- Oh honey, LDRs are always like this. You always remain in doubt and in this situation I'd say until and unless you both plan to stay in the same city, do not get emotionally involved. You never know what is going on at the other end. But do not be that much doubtful that to ruin the thing between the two of you if he is staying true to you.</h1>
