<p>Hi,Im a 21 year old male. I thought i was straight until i happened to meet a very cute boy at college! we both became friends,i developed the unusual love towards him without his knowledge about this,i once confessed everything with him and to my shock i found out he too had similar feelings for me! Then we made out at his house...everything was good and smooth until we had an anal sex,it was very painful yet giving him pleasure,gave me an immense pleasure in return! But everytime its me who has to offer him my ass,he is not at all ready to give his! I feel like a slut now :-(</p>
<h1>GCI- This is a very bad stereotype that the guy who prefers being passive, is low and the one who prefers being active is at a higher position. Don't feel like a slut. You don't take money to have sex with him. If he doesn't agree just stop having sex with him if you don't feel like doing it.</h1>
