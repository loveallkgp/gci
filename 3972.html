<p>hey everyone what's up???? today d topic im gonna confess about iz really akward (i think so)... do someone beleive in such conditions that if a parent having multiple number of female child if wishes male child or vice versa have d highest risk of d baby being born with. opposite sex (lgbt)?????
I know everyone may laugh at such dumbass confession but beside these alll in practical life I have heard about so many incidences news of such situation..... do someone beleive in. it??</p>
<h1>GCI- You mean if there are 5 girls and a guy in a home then the male child will be gay? It is a genuine question and I didn't laugh at it. Until you question, you will never know the truth.</h1>
<p>Look at it the other way around. I know about some people who are all male siblings but one of them is gay. I have seen youtube videos about two male siblings who both came out as gay. So I don't think that having more number of female siblings is kinda responsible for making anyone gay or vice versa.</p>
<p>At the end, can we please stop finding answers for our existence? We exist, isn't that enough?</p>
