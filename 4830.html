<h1>GCI- Haye. Bichare ko dono hi namune mile. See buddy, if you don't have any feelings for someone, never ever try to raise their hopes and expectations for this long. Also, self harm is no way to prove your love. It's true that actions speak louder than words but the actions should be sensible and not foolish. Your ex is kinda comparing the wrong situations.</h1>
