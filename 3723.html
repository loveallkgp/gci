<p>heloo admins...you are doing a greattt job...i dnt know how u able to manage...i mean living out there all alone...i personally know how hard it it to mange out dere on your own...coping up with the job..daily food problem..no proper maids and what not yaar...but still u manage to do soo much for dis page...hats off to you..:) and for those who abuse dem just one line for you pple perfectly suits u.."HAATI CHALE BAZAR KUTTE BHOKE HAZAR"</p>
<p>now smethng fr d readers and confessors of dis page...i m a regular reader of dis page...and what i found common in between most of the confessions is tht one or the other person is stick to a person...even after lot of things happened between dem he is not able to just move on...lets talk abt the recent confessions..
a boy of 20,s confessing abt a person who is in affair wth 3 pple and in relation with an another person still loves him...nd that lovely child still thinks that he love him..and he is stuck with him...you know what guys the basic reason behind this kind of behavior is that after loving someone we starts to neglect other relations of our life...and after having some bad exp. with that person,we find tht there is no one who cares abt us other than that single person...and then develops a tendency of d same...guysss....you have born all lone in this world..and gonna die all alone...then why u want any other person to respect you...i know we are humans and we need someone by our side at lot of tymes...but keep in mind that there is no one superior to you fr you in this world...if you want some respect frm others then frstly have some self respect...have some attitude man...and there are lot of pple around you who cares for you, wht you need to do is just open you eyes...at tymes we become so obsessed wth a person tht we are not able to see any other...believe me guyss the world is full of happyness nd sadness its only us who have to choose...
whtever we do we knw whether it is right or wrong for us...talkng abt a confessor who says he is in relation wth a person in his 50's who abuse him beat him and what not...dude dont u knw wht is good fr you and what is wrong..???d part we are lacking is tht we dont accept the things...d other person abt whom i hve mentioned earlier who is in his 20's....man u are 20 yrs old and you cleared ipcc tht means you have cleared it in first or second attempt...dude u are such a brilliant student...stop wasting ur tym for such a bastard and care for yourself...once you become successful you will get the right person for you...you have good friends..enjoy with them...</p>
<p>lyf is soo small just make the most of it..:) </p>
<p>watch this video..change your way of thinking...dnt just watch it for once watch it for once thrice nd multiple tymes...it will boost your thinking ability...and beilve me if you do what it says..your lyf will be amazing in just few months..:)
