<p>Raipur</p>
<p>It has been very difficult for me to accept myself as gay and now I am having this moobs thing on my body. Sometimes I feel like "God! why me?" . I am a slim guy so the situation is worse. Agar I was fat to I shyd itni problem nai hoti. Some of my friends have even noticed this thing. I feel so embarrassed! Dont know what to do. I know exercise could help but I just hate exercising. And I dont have money that I can afford a surgery. So depressed.</p>
<p>And one more thing there are some people here who are so pessimistic. At least if you cant motivate , encourage someone please dont demotivate them by your negative comments!!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>And admin tu ta kamal hi karta by creating this page! Love you so much :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Even my friend had this problem. He had a surgery to remove that extra fat on his chest. Atleast don't hate exercises. Go to a gym and start working out. Maybe you won't be depressed as you are now after you get the desired result.</h1>
