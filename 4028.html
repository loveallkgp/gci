<p>From my personal experiences I feel that homosexuality is often imposed on people from the circumstances they live in rather than a free choice or an innate predisposition. I am a muslim from Glasgow incase you don't know that's in Scotland. Being from an Indian heritage, my family was very conservative and my dad was very strict and abusive towards my mother and myself. This made my timid as a child and I became feminine, I always looked for a male partner to support me. Although in my early teen years I showed exclusive and singular interest in girls, later I started liking guys more. Another reason was that my family regulations did not allow me to interact much with the so called corrupted and slutty white girls. This lead to me thinking that it was in appropriate to talk to girls and I gradually shunned them. This is my personal view drawn upon from the evidence of my life. I also feel that gays need to get their mental health assessed although it may sound harsh but there is a greater likelihood of anamolous behaviour among gays. This might be implicated by the bullying they face in schools and at family, social ostracism, childhood abuse, or personal family circumstances and gender identification issues as in most cases these predicaments do factor into the deeper realms of a persons psycological faculties. They are often emotionally shattered, feel inferior, less confident, recluse away from society or show erratic behaviours and tread into depression.
I don't know if it's appropriate for me to post on this page as it is for the indian audience but just thought of reinstating my humble opinion.</p>
<h1>GCI- Whatever happened with you is very bad but stop trying to find the reason for your existence. It just gets painful when you don't find the right one or try to fit in the pieces to fill the big jigsaw puzzle. I have seen people with the same environment getting competitive and turning out to be straight. Even My childhood was not good but my parents never bullied me or stopped me for anything. Yet again I turned out to be a gay. As much I have socialized with gay guys and girls here, they have had pretty much good life where they were not forced to stay at home, yet they all turned out to be gay. All I know is that bullying or stopping someone to socialize cannot turn anyone gay. If you are gay, then you are and you do exist by nature.</h1>
