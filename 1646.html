<p>This is nt confsn. I want to ask all indians one question. I am from north east india. I want to ask why main land indians use to treat us like we are from dif country? And even treated us mre then a dog. Calng us like chikis or watsoever. And will insult us for nt knwing hindi ;-( we dnt knw hindi becoz itz no way related to our blood. Some got beating and sme had been kiled . M so sad for that . Cn anyone sugest why they treated us like that? </p>
<h1>Viv- Darling, first of all there is nothing like mainland indians and other land indians. Do not discriminate against yourself by dividing the area. You are a part of india very much as everyone here. And people who discriminate are those assholes who have nothing better to do in their lives. Its the same fucking society who discriminates against us for being different. The society cannot accept the different people, different thinking, or anything that is not a part of their so-called mainstream paradigm. It really hurts me when people are killed or picked upon just on the basis of their face structure. Come one, seriously? I hate such morons. It really is bad that when we read in books that india is a land where unity in diversity is celebrated while in reality the fucking loosers are killing the diversity by discriminating to prove their effing looser dominance.</h1>
