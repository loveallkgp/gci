<p>I'm stupid for trying this thing. But anyway, I have to.
Are you people dumbshits (they know who they are)?
Giving advices out of nowhere, just making stories out of your own head, kind of like what they do in movies.
 I don't think a short piece of confession would provide anybody this much information that they start judging their indentity. I mean judging stupid comments is ok but confessions, no, no, no. ( except for the confessions like mine or like the one in which one suggested about finding out if someon's gay or more precisely about getting yourself slapped, etc you are free to judge them).
 Put yourself in their position, think with an open mind and learn to be ready to learn new things and yeah, respect everyone's point of view. People are different, like really different, try to understand that. And if you're confused and don't know what to say, I request you, please please please don't you puke shit down the confessions.
Thank you
one of the stupid among the crowd.</p>
