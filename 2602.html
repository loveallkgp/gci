<p>Hola guys!!.... ^_^
HEllo admin!!..... Goodii eveniii......</p>
<p>Well... jumping to the point!!..... :)
It isn't a confession... but a advice and warning!... :O O_O</p>
<p>Yes.....
Yesterday i went to a very famous men's outfit shop in my city..... To get dress for a wedding party....
I have a habit... like, i try every dress before i buy them..... (obviously, almost everyone does!!! :P ) and so... i took a pile of dresses and marched towards the trail room..... :)
And i was trying pants..... here too, every time i check for the pants to be clean before wearing it!......
OMG.... this time i encountered something near the zipper area..... :3
Yes.... i found some small black dots at the clip and zipper part..... when i examined close..... i freaked out!!.... yes!! Those black dots are so called "PUBIC LICE!"..... Geeezzzz!!!</p>
<p>It was a white colored pant!... so i was able to see em clearly!!..... Eww!!</p>
<p>Shit!!!... yes!... someone had tried the pant before... and he wasn't clean.... may be, he din't wear his underwear or so!!..... GROSS!!!...... -_-!!</p>
<p>Well.... Usually, pubic lice won't survive when they are outta body temperature!...
Still it happens in some cases, that they survive!!!.... Ewwwwwwwwww.......
And as we know..... Pubic lice can bring a case to STD's!!....</p>
<p>So guys!!.... what i am trying to say is!!</p>
<ol>
<li>Be careful while you try dresses in a shop!!</li>
<li>Please be clean while you try for a dress!!.......</li>
<li>Please, check out properly before you try wearing the new dress!!</li>
<li>And, report it to the manager or someone about the issue if you found any!... so that you can avoid someone else getting affected!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Huh!!.... There are dicks all around!!.... so be cautious while you try for new dresses!!.... ^<em>^
Happy buying!!.... ^</em>^</p>
<p>Yours!
PK (Pradeep Kashyap)</p>
