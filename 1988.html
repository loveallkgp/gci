<h1>Ash 19,</h1>
<p>Our parents brings us to this world, they rise us and we are dependent over them for whole life, even after if we are dependent.
Our parents gives us care, affections and fulfill all the needs with emotional and sensitive touch of love in it.
A mother is always soft and more emotional expressive. In all situations she take care of the child not bear pain. And we are more attached to our mother. Comparatively father is bit hard, that doesn't mean we are not loved. He fulfill all our needs.
There are many children which are away from their parents, even most of never experienced their love. These children are alone and are struggling for their future and existence.
We people can take a step by parenting. I think a gay is as soft as a mother and capable to love as a father. My self being gay, love children very much. I love kids and I wish to take a step towards this set. We people have better experienced the world and seen almost every corner of mentality among people. We are capable to stand and be strong.
Gay Parenting can be said to be an art of care, love affection, understanding. This can be a gift to very lucky children.
With our broad view, we can handle every situation wisely. Sometimes we are unable to express few problems to our parents, but we can definitely sort the children's problem.
I can prove myself a better parents and I can. I feel we people have the caliber to fulfill the requirement, weather is emotional, social, financial or anything else.
We people can make a better place in society by doing this.
friends, lets give a bit of ours and let GOD proud over his wonderful creation, "we people"
If I can, you can.</p>
<h1>GCI- Only today I read an article that adoption process is going to be a lot easier than it was before. And when we will get our rights we will surely move our struggle for legal marriage status and adoption.</h1>
<p>BTW, I feel that if gay people choose to be parents, they can be much better at parenting because it is their need and not a responsibility bestowed like it is with heterosexual people.</p>
