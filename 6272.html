<p>I turned 30 last week and feel so much emptiness. Being in closet and staying single after 28 was a big battle. Family friends collegues constantly forced, humiliated or emotionally blackmailed me to marry but I stayed strong. My first bf was bisexual but he left me to get married after 2 yrs. So i looked for gay gays only and found a nice guy. He promised to stay with me always but just 1 month before he left me too saying he wants to marry. He wants to continue relation after marriage but i refused. I dont find any single gay men in my age group. I guess I will die alone.</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all congrats and salute for ur stand against the ineluctable and taking stand for ur life.</h1>
<p>Now dear if u think u r gonna die alone then work on being ur friend first and try to become more saturated and satiated with urself. Ultimately u will have that special one who will be ur mirror image.
Never give up on urself and the universe shall not give up on u. </p>
<p>P.S - U need courageous gay guy to be with u..not a spineless double standard fucked up grey matter lacking moron.</p>
