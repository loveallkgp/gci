<p>Hi guys this is Kunal 25 from Delhi (basically from Kanpur). I had just completed my graduation and was waiting for the appointment letter to come when I thought that it was the right time to come out. I told my parents that I am gay. My father was furious, he said that I was sick and needed treatment. I refused. He said ki agar ilaj nahin karwaoge to apni shakal dikhane ki zaroorat nahin hai. I left the house and stayed at a friends house in Lucknow from where I went to Delhi after I got the appointment letter. It was very tough initially to complete the joining formalities without my parents support as they even declined my request to sign the service agreement. Somehow I managed everything, even had to take loans from my friends. Me and my partner are doing quite well now. We have recently bought a new car and are planning to buy a house together in the near future. So coming back to my story, my father was suffering from some kidney problem. I got to know this from one of my cousins and he was on dialysis for almost an year, but he passed away a week back. I was not informed about it even by my elder brother or any other relative. I have been ostracized by almost everyone. It was through that cousin of mine that I got to know. I don't know what exactly has been told by my parents to my relatives about me. My mother didn't ever called me in all these three years. She even refused to give me some money while I was leaving. I don't know if I should go or not. My partner says that we should visit them once, but I think otherwise. I don't want to create any scene. </p>
<h1>GCI- There are so many things to be said but I just can't. I really can't imagine the pain you'd be feeling throughout the years. Disowning by family, a complete cut off, no information about the father's demise. I am so sorry. This is why we need acceptance and law on our side so that people are not disowned by their families. But it's good that you have a partner and you are building your lives together. I hope after each and every pain, you both get to live together forever. I just hope the best for you.</h1>
