<p>Hi guys,
I am a straight guy 25 yrs old. My bestie is gay and of same age. We are best friends since our childhood. He came out to me during the last semester of my college. We still studying together. We share all our secrets and stuff with each other. Though I don't want to hear too much details of his sex life, I am always there to listen to him. I am not saying I am the best friend or the perfect friend. We have our fair share of arguments.
I want your help in this. He fell for a guy who is our fellow classmate. He is bisexual and is often described as a playboy. Never seen him together with anyone for than a week. He is quite open about his sexuality and is quite flamboyant. I am not jealous or anything if you wondering. My friend is crazy for him. They had sex last week and I thought it would be over. But my friend is more obsessed with him now. I am finding very hard to reach through to him. He is definitely gonna get hurt. He was there for me when I was love stricken but I want to prevent him from that. Do advise me.
Thanks
Neil</p>
<h1>Viv- He needs a reality check, honey. Tell him about that guy and ask your friend to keep the thingy with him just till sex and nothing more. Have a serious talk with that you care for him and do not wish to see him in any harm. Kill all the butterflies that he might have in his tummy.</h1>
