<p>It so often happens that you fall in love with the person you hate the most. There is a guy in my profile A. Mehra. I know nothing about him, absolutely nothing except that perhaps he is from Delhi.. We had talked long back. And he was full of attitude.</p>
<p>I stopped talking to him. But we still speak ill of each other. It seems there are others too he has befriended and then disillusioned with his misbehaviour...
but I think, I just think that I would one day love to meet him. Kiss him, fuck him, show him heaven and make him mine, forever.
But then I think, why bother with such petty people in my life?</p>
<p>P.S : you are very active in this page it seems, are you gay? A. Mehra?</p>
