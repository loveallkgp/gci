<p>Is there any treatment for HPV?
i meant anal warts?</p>
<p>i guess i have anal warts, little growth in muscles in rectum, and sometimes its itchy and sometimes cough like jelly comes out with stool.. 
i talked to my friends n they said go to homeopathy ..</p>
<p>i went and i clearly told my symptoms to the doc and i even told him that my friends said that it could be anal wart..</p>
<p>n doctor said it could be piles too so he gave some remedy to me and told to me to take it for next 10 days and come again... will have to continue this till it gets cured..</p>
<p>so tell me how much time will it take?
and does that medicine which I'm taking  cures both piles and warts?
i heard homeopathic medicine are almost same for treatment of same area of people..</p>
<p>please I'm already little upset, sad and scared, regretting too.. so give positive answer...</p>
<h1>GCI- As far as my knowledge goes yes its curable but U need to be sure of its presence and must not indulge in any sexual activity until it gets treated and cured. And dear its fine, don't get worried too much. Rest the doctors on the page may help him further by calming his mind.</h1>
