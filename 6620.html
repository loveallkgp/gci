<p>Just saw a random post from a local Gay men's group, it goes like...'Looking for a true friend'. Often did I come through these kinda posts. I myself in teenage gave this kinda posts a few times, but now, I question myself "Do these guys not have anyone with whom they can share everything, including sexuality?"
I myself did not, but when I 'came out' to my friends,  nothing changed!!!
So to those who are looking for a 'true friend': "You either speak clearly that you are actually looking for a GAY friend to share feelings, or more than that; or perhaps you should consider trying out with the peers you already have."
I doubt whether I made myself clear, all I'm saying is we all have good friends, but we often think that straight friends may not get our feelings, and that's why we look for Queer friends; but this Adds are so sad to read, it's everyone's fault, fault on our side that we fear coming out, and hence can not trust straight friends, and straight friends (most I'd say) fail to relate to the feelings of a queer friend often, and hence we don't feel like sharing..I myself feel reluctant; fault of society that we consider Queerness a taboo, and hence creating invisible  barriers between straight and queer, and making a queer person to post 'I want a good friend' in social networking sites.
Sad.</p>
<h1>GCI - U know what is even sadder?? Gay guys sobbing day and night virtually for love and acting like a drama queen and a real bitch when they do get a good guy. Gawdd such hypocrisy is shown by the same gay men and boys who turn out to be closeted morons and many of them then JOIN THE MAINSTREAM in homophobia....I mean ridiculous just got a new meaning by our other fellow mates.</h1>
<p>P.S- The only 'true' people who live life on their own terms are the true GAYMEN according to me and they are GAY-MEN! Dare if anyone brings out the notion of feminine and masculine gay men here again.
N.B- This type of ads are meant seasonally and for the purpose of getting a romantic gay friend (maximum cases) and there is no inter relation b/w immature gays SEARCHING LOVE in fooling themselves and  truly matured sensible gay guys themselves in 'understanding' love ...Is love always the lost entity or what?!</p>
