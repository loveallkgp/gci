<p>Okay here is a tricky question. Hope the readers and the admin will answer.</p>
<p>A and B are in love. very good relationship, cute n all. And then one day, B breaks up, coz he want to marry a girl. He is NOT bi, he is gay. A cries and cries, but B doesnt came back. After some months, A comes to know that B is engaged. A and B still talk but less. B tells A that he wants to leave gay life and start a new life after his marriage. He also tells A not to tell anyone about their relationship. He says that, A, you will always my first love. But I cannot be with you. A gets very upset. A has no option but to move on</p>
<p>After a few days, A meets C. A and C instantly click and start developing feelings. It is almost how A felt with B. C is as caring as B was. One day, C invites A to his cousin sister's marriage. It would be a good excuse to meet C's family.</p>
<p>A goes to the marriage and is shocked. The groom (dulha) is B. </p>
<p>Now, A is confused- should he tell C about B to protect his cousin from getting married to a gay guy. Coz afterall, C is like family to A.</p>
<p>Or, should A keep quiet for the sake of promise he gave to B. He loved B for a long time and still loves him, He knows B is not coming back, still he doesnt want to destroy B's life. Telling everyone will ruin B's life and image.</p>
<p>But not telling would be like a cheating towards C. What if C finds out later?</p>
<p>A is very confused. Help him.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well....</h1>
