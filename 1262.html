<p>Hey frnds..</p>
<p>My confession is completely strange..you might dislike it but wht to do im compld to post it bcz i hve been sufrng through it since 5 years. when i was in grade 8 , i got a diffrnt feeling than my frnds used to gocip at class. I had attraction with boys( espcily with mature guy like teachers).. Since that day i realize im gay im begun to be silence than wht i used to be .</p>
<p>I fell in love with my clasmate durung +2 n still i love him very much.. He loves me too but as frnd..I can still rembr those swt scenario with him at hostel. somtime bcz of alot of frndss gatherd in our room we hve to share same bed.. we used to sleep by huging each other..no more than that. But i nver told him that im in love with u.. bcz he is straight n he has gf as well. Im straight too in apprearance but not internaly .i hve got many love propse frm girls but i alwys refuesed bcz my feelings is gay</p>
<p>.Now im student of MBBS at Kathmandu medical college. i tired alot tohde my feelings... i wish i would havnt such unnatural feelings..but natural made me like that... I hate my life.. i still talk with him in phn n Fb..sometime i feel i have to show my feelings towards him but i fear our frncip can get hurt.. so wht should i do frnd??? plz give me suggestion.</p>
<h1>Viv- Nature made you like that so its NOT unnatural. Same problem, same solution. You have to get out of your feelings for him because your real chance at love is with a gay guy. The sooner you realize and accept it, the better.</h1>
