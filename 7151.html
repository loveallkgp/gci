<h1>7142 Hello dear admin I am 25 years old guy (b) I need a perfect partner for me but I can't found . lots of person are like me but no one accept me everyone is cheater , selfish , lier . everyone need only sex . so I ask you that sex is everything kya emotion ka koi value nahi hai I want to marry a good guy who can love me more , jo mera sath jindgi bhar de kya eaisa nahi ho sakta. Kya muje whole life single hi rehna padega plz admin help me</h1>
<h1>GCI- Well, to talk on the aspect of getting a partner I would put this in points for u to be explicit about it.</h1>
<p>1- The more u ask for being with someone because u need a supporting hand in ur life is gonna make u emotionally handicapped(like forever).
2- 90% Gay men in our country are not in a stable mental condition to be with someone because u already know the sociological set up of our country.
3- Sex shaming is not gonna help u in finding a partner because that needs to be understood on a broader basis of sex, relationship and sex, sex and love, and importance of sex and asexuality.
4- U need to understand the u must inculcate the capacity to live alone and be strong in that condition because only then u will truly understand what is self-love and indestructible love.
5- Emotional value depends on acquiring emotional intelligence and knowing when not to use it.
6- U need to love ur lover like u love ur family and must receive the same in return. Its called equal investing of emotions in love.
7- Love is a very broad aspect and u having inhibitions about anything or everything about love will make u unfit to be with someone in the long run.
8- Be the kind of person u want in ur life and u shall get it when u r really that able to hold someone and vice versa.</p>
<p>P.S- U just need to grow from all the sides first, then see how better u feel with someone and lastly what kind of an empire u can build with him because relationships are kinda outdated these days.</p>
