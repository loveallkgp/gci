<p>Male, 21.
Student of b.tech @ Mumbai.
Hello friends, I wanna share my feelings for someone
I am from Delhi, doing b.tech in mumbai. I had a bf who was proper mumbaikar.
As I am student I am dependent on my parents economically.
I hv quite rich family. So I always used to spend much money on my love.
But I heard from my friend thatmy bf was with someone else last day. I didn't belived. But later I found my bf dating others too. I decided to ask him. I caught him &amp; beat him so much. He was crying. But I really want him to hurt now. I am totally broken now. I left my gf for him &amp; he cheated on me. He trying to stay away from me but i want him to tell me the reason of cheating me. I don't want to love him again but i dnt wish to loose him. I dont know why he did this to me.
I am good in looks, good family, always cared him. I never forced him for sex. Actually we never go behind kiss.
my friend says that he wasn't happy with me because i didnt devloped physical relation.
I am just totally broken now
I hate u </p>
<h1>GCI- You don't want to leave him? Leave him this very instant. You cannot live with him under this pressure of betrayal. Say him goodbye and don't look at him again.</h1>
