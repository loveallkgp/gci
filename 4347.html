<p>Hello Readers and Admin.
Actually, there's a guy who says that he loves me andbI know him too. We were just friends. I want to accept his proposal but I am fearful.
Actually, He belongs to a rich family and that's my main concern. I think I have generally developed a sterotypical image of rich. I think they use people as toyboys. I think he will use me as a toyboy and then he will leave me. He's a rich guy so he can get any guy. I also doubt that why such a good looking, rich guy would fall for me? He says that he loves my personality, that I am caring, loving and so helpful. He also says that I am so cute and he thinks a lot about me. All of you may think that If we were friends, I should know his character. He is a nice person but I don't know something irriates me when I think of his background. Yesterday, he told me that he loves me a lot and he wants to be with me. I think I love him too but...
I have no one to consult sp this platform is my last hope.</p>
<h1>GCI- Try coming out of the stereotypes and just go with him for once. Do make sure that you get some questions answered like "what will be the future?" etc. If you feel like, you can discuss this very thing with him too. It would be better for you that you have this mature conversation. But if at any point you feel like you are not being treated respectfully, you can always move ahead. Know him as a person and then start judging him. Judging in the starting will never get you to a good place. You might loose a very nice person in that way.</h1>
