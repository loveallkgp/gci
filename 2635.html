<p>This is gonna be a long 1. Bear with me mates, i just want to pour my heart out.</p>
<p>The story of me finding a best friend , having a 1 sided luv for him and ultimately being his greatest enemy.</p>
<p>4 years of friendship i had to break as i was literally killing myself over my STR8 friend.
All things were gud wen we met first tym in the boys hostel, nuturing a good friendship. having the so called boy talks discussing chicks fantacising dem. however things started to change in my life as i was getting attracted to him tried to resist bt could not let my heart overrule my heart, but things started happening
There would not be a single day when he would not wake me up with a Good Morning and me going to his room to wish him Good night, but in the 3 rd year of our friendship my ex best friend fell in luv with a chick. Naturally i did feel insecure as he would not be spending time with me talking about d day to day progress, so one day I am called to have a discussion by this  new couple at the girls behest " Sorry Bhaiya , Apke best friend ka dil maine chura liya. Apko bura toh nahi laga?" these words though said innocently killed me inside bt as a sober friend i replied in the negative. 
with no choice left (didnt wanna be kabab main haddi as the couple need to have private moments, I distanced myself and my so called inocent friend tried to acertain d reason bt as i am very adament refuse to budge in 
But things didnt not turn out good for me as my friend started to bully me , would publically call me Gay homo, left with no choice  i  moved out of the hostel,  just could not bear it.
Pr anth main mujhpr hi ilzaam lagaya gaya ki mere karan mere so called best friend aur uski gf ka break up hua , this friend of mine killed me his words his actions his behaviour , every personal thing that i had shared with him he made it public 
sorry amigos bt kuch aur nhi soch pa raha tha siwaye yahan likhne ke 
there isnt any1 whom i could open up directly so m doing it annnymously 
Thanks a lot for ur time GCI, U REALLY ARE INDEED A GREAT HUMAN BEING </p>
<h1>GCI ; i totally think we shall all give a personal space to people even if they are our best friends . and when a best friend gets a gf or bf  , try to understand that they have to spend time with their lovers and we shall totally distant ourselves from their love matters .</h1>
<p>secondly he was totally rude to call you names openly . maybe he thought that his relation broke with his gf because of you ( maybe they had some talk about you which u don't know after which she might have left him ) . and in frustration he called you gay and let the things out which you have shared only with him .</p>
<p>now i want to say there is no such thing as enemies . considering people your enemies will just burn your blood nothing else . just get to know that this person's charcter is over in your story and now you two shall move on .</p>
