<p>hey ! this is Subhash and its my second confession I was in a relationship with a guy two years back , his name was Adi, Adi Malik . He was from Dubai and he is in Mumbai now. We got separated only because of me and I explained it to him as to why we had to do that. Sorry guys cannot tell you out the reason. Adi was a very handsome and sweet guy , and he told me a year back that he got committed to another guy. I was so happy for him. He might have probably liked this page and thats the reason why am posting all these here . I have a small message to him . " Adi, how are you ? Its been sooooo many days since we spoke. I had lost your number, but am damn sure that you would not have done that. Please text me. And apna dhyan rakna . bye. " Admin bhai , kindly tag my profile so that he will be able to contact me. Btw admins of this page , thanks a lot for all your "service" to "our" community . To all others , have a great day ahead Love you Adi </p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks for the appreciation! ^_^</h1>
