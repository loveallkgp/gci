<p>i just watched a show 'Code Red' on colors channel which have given a grt message to society abt the transgenders. in this episode a boy was borned in village family where everyone refused him n tried to give them to hijra community BT due to his mother's effort no one able to do that BT they have to leave the village BT in Mumbai his grandfather gave that child to hijra community BT his mother saved his child with the help of police n socialist. as world is modernizing we should also move on. lgbt people r becoming successful in each n every field art,dance,politics,technology. so being a gay I support lgbt n transgenders proudly.</p>
<h1>GCI- I sometimes feel that some people in India give birth to kids just to show the society that they can. If the kid doesn't meet the "requirements" of the society, she/he is dumped. Why some people cannot stick to their kids?</h1>
