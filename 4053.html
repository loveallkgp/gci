<p>Though I don't believe in any political ideology.. but seeing BJP And RSS ideology dts hell tough that govt will overrule the supreme court decision...</p>
<p>because if any one knws than before few months when congress was ruling sonia gandhi and rahul had opposed supreme court's decision and was even planning for passing ordinance..</p>
<p>and last night in abp news d one who was opposing amir khan was man from RSS.</p>
<p>so no chance for change in decision still modi government is ruling. . lets hope for the best </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, they know it is a part of our culture, they know homosexuality was quite open in India since thousands of years, they know its been written about in our books as well and they know we have been there ever since and still they say that homosexuality is against nature and they cannot allow it. They are arguing just for the sake of arguing. They don't have nothing new to say. They have the plain old arguments. They forgot that we are not asking/begging for our rights. We are fighting for it. And fighting is not equal to begging. We are not beneath anyone and certainly people with ideologies like theirs can never be superior even in their heads.</h1>
