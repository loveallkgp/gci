<p>first time wann say something. personally I don't knw admin. who is he ? his nature etc etc..</p>
<p>but from few days his one sentence is killing me.. though its none of my business. he has that right. but now I could not control myself from posting this.</p>
<p>once admin said that when ur parents say about marrying a girl.. say them to have divorce. how can u give such suggestions dude ??? At least think once before u utter ur words. was hell disappointed by ur words </p>
<h1>GCI- I guess it was the other admin. But didn't you get the meaning behind his words? All he wanted to say that a gay guy getting married to a girl is just as difficult for your parents getting a divorced. He didn't mean it literally.</h1>
