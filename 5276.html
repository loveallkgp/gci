<p>I met a guy for a one night stand. After talking him for a while I began to have a crush on him. He looks and talks exactly like the guy of my dreams. Now usually when I meet people for hookups I do not flirt and behave in a serious tone which is my normal way of interaction. When I speak with someone I have a crush on, i totally looses it and I blush and speak in broken sentences. So this is how i behaved with this guy and he ended up thinking I am a weirdo.. Also this guy is only into one night stand and is very much promiscuous. He has mentioned in his account ezplicitly that he is not into any relationship shit. Even though we had awesome sex, he doesn't want us to hangout or do anything like that. I honestly want him to be my last guy but I just know that its totally impossible. What should be my next step?</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh honey, crushes are something that leave you after sometime. You just got to get hit with a reality. If you know what he wants, then there is no need to imagine things happening between the two of you. Be mature on that.</h1>
