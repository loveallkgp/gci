<p>Gosh!! Its so happened today tat My gay Identity would have been revealed to whole society. I had few gay movies in my pen drive and I had hidden it. And I almost forgot that hidden fact. i wanted to take my resume printout and hence I went to a crowded Cyber shop. I gave my pen drive and he inserted it to his PC USB slot. Damn fuck , that guy has turned on Show hidden option on his PC. For one sec, I was shocked coz I saw All Gay movies clearly visible on his PC screen. I quickly asked him to move to my resume folder and got the print out. There were many beside me starring at the Screen. phew!!! I just pray no one had seen those gay thing . Coz afterwards he just removed my pen drive and was casual. Then I got confirmed that even he might have overlooked that gay thing ; moreover he was busy in operating so many pen drives . Finally a sign of Relief 4 me. Ufff!! Wat a moment it was. My heart almost started beating thrice the normal..he he :) :)</p>
<h1>Viv- Something like this happened with me too... And the guy got to know about my identity but nothing happened.</h1>
