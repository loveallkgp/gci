<h1>GCI- Oh darling, you are horny, accept that. If a choice is given to you to do anything without having any guilt, you will jump on his bones and fuck his brains out. But you are help back by something. Maybe moral values of your own thinking? That depends on you if you want to fuck him or not. You cannot have a relationship with him, because he is with a girl. If you cannot make anything for you both, then better fuck him and leave him.</h1>
<p>If you don't wanna fuck him, then find someone else.</p>
