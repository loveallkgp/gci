<p>"Being Muslim and gay is impossible." Some fellas said in here few days ago. There were many guys who think it that way. Dudes, educated yourself first before talking.
There are millions of people who r gay and MUSLIM.
A living example is me! I'm Gay n Muslim. Now dont you dare call me a non-believer.
ANAL SEX (done with a man or even WOMAN) or any 'unnatural' sex (i.e. other than vaginal) is considered a sin in Islam. (latter one maybe claimed unislamic).
Now, for the sake of argument, lets say being gay is a sin in Islam (though its written no where that just being gay is a sin in islam, anal sex is! ). In this situation, lets say I commit sin. Now, does merely commiting a sin makes me a non-muslim? NO. Do you know who a muslim is?
A Muslim is anyone who truly believes in one God, that is Allah, and his prophet Muhammad (pubh).
Telling lies, deceiving people, adultery, i.e. having sex outside the marriage and with someone other than ur spouse (WHICH IS BIGGER SIN IN ISLAM THAN ANAL SEX), not washing genital organs after urination, not giving sadka and zakat, discriminating people, exposing 'satar' , etc. are few of many unislamic deeds millions of muslims do everyday, even you do multiple of them, today almost everyone does commit sin!
If we go this way, then eveyone is non-muslim, right?
Who is muslim and who's not is not known by anyone but Allah. Who gave you right to judge that a gay guy is not muslim? Those who have extra marital relationships with numerous other women and even visit prostitutes? or those who dont even know how many rakats are there in each five namaazs of the each day ( Namaaz Five times a day is compulsion for every muslim, btw), or those who dont even remember Ayat-al-kursi?
If they said so, then to me they are not muslims! Look inside of you! How Muslim you are? Do you do everything a muslim is supposed to do? I'm sure you dont do a quarter of that!
I'm gay but I can definitely say that I'm more of a muslim that YOU are! I at least try to follow everything a muslim is supposed to do - and sins, everyone does it, i do it too.
I can so proudly say that, despite being gay, I'm much better of a Muslim than millions of other 'straights' and even those gays n bisexuals who disguise themselves in the cover of 'true straight muslim'
You know Pakistan, one of the most homophobic nations, where if you ask people if they'd like free rights of homosexuals, 92% of them would say NO. Yes, those people of Pakistan, the muslim nation, came up number ONE in the list of Google search for gay porn and gay stuff. Do you guys read newspaper? -_-
And, another anti-gay Muslim nation, Iran has the second highest number (after Thailand) of sex change surgery in the world.
Adultery is too very much common among Indians as well, yes, Muslims included.
And, those guys who claim themselves 'Muslim' what are you doing on this page? Go away. Be straight and clean and then come up to tell me how much muslim I'm not, Okay? People like you do everything without letting other know and then come up and say 'All the gays should be killed' n all. Freaking cowards ! Munafiqs, i must say. I'm sure u guys urself are gay but among other people you guys must be the one saying the harshest words about gays. You poor souls. May Allah give you little sense along with courage. At least be what you are and if you cant then, please, don't judge others and before calling anyone something bad, make sure you yourself are equal good than that, only then you deserve to say something.
I've not given you any freaking right to judge my Imaan. I know, according to Islam, I'm not the best person in the world, I accept that. Everyone has flaws, I have it too. And when I die, I'm ready to get any punishment I might get. But just coz m gay, I wont stop believing on Allah. Being Muslim and being gay can go hand in hand if you know how to handle them properly. You have no compulsion of leaving anyone for the sake of the other. Let you define your life and not somebody else or the society. But yes, have the guts to face the afterwards!
Enjoy the life fellas. Keep things independent of one another and do what YOU think is right, in the right way. Believe your senses, not some stupid, idiotic people who claim to be the 'society', and definitely not the type of guys i mentioned above :3
.xoxo.
P.S. Those guys for whom I've written, Read this confession and if you still decide to call me a non-Muslim, then stop calling yourself one too, you're on this page, man, why? ;)</p>
