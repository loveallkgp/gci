<h1>GCI- Okay you broke up, realized that you did a mistake, remembered that you had a lot of good time with each other and tried o forget whatever negative happened. Now you are thinking that you both need to get back once again. You can give it a second try but do not repeat the mistake that you did or he made. Also it has to be a both sided decision and not just from your side or from his side. Better thing would be to talk it out like mature people.</h1>
