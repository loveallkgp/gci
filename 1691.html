<p>Frnds !!! I m in a big problem n also in confusion :(</p>
<p>I wanna tell U that I was in a relationship 4-5 years since 2006-2010
After that my bf went to America fear of society n no rights for gays in India n settled there
I m still waiting for him but I have accepted this truth he will never return back in my life or in India.
Before 7-8 months I got a frnd from my straight life from Facebook. We met n became friends n spent a long n mostly time together
We both like each other company but in starting days he told me that he was in a relationship n committed with his childhood love. And they both R in relationship for just 6 months. I n my friend live in Delhi but his lover n childhood frnd doing job in Banglore so they both meet rarely
In present time n before few moths he told me that he loves me a lot. He wants to be my love bcoz he felt an awsum feelings with me. At the time I accepted his love bcoz I was alone in my life n everyone knows that nobody's life ever be spent in wait. But he says that me n his childhood lover R two eyes for him so he can never compromise with both of us
He loves to both of us. Neither He can ever leave his love nor he will ever want to leave me bcoz his love z equal to me n his childhood frnd
He says we all will be live together in future
I accept his all things bcoz I truely love him a lot
But I m afraid what will happen when his lover will know all this ?? Will he ever accept our TRUE love ???
Indian psychology is that nobody can share his love with any other guy so will he really accept me as his lover's love ???
I wanna tell about mine. I m very soft nature n polite person. Mera dil bhi bahut bada haii mai uske bachpan k pyar ko v accept kar Chuka hu aakhir wo uska pahla pyar jo haii par mai apne pyar ko v nahi khona chahta pyar me ek bar judayi dard jhel chuka hu dubara wo aansu aankho me nahi chahta :'(</p>
<p>Guys plz help me suggest me what I do ??? :'(</p>
<h1>Viv- What kind of a situation is this? Threesome love? One thing you haven't mentioned is that his childhood lover is a guy or a girl. In either case, its not gonna be good for you 3 at all. I really don't know what the guy is playing at but he should talk about all of this to the other person too. Aur isme apni bhi thodi self respect rakho. How can you be in love with someone who is already with someone?</h1>
