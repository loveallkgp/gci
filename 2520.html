<p>it was never supposed to happen............whatever i went through in my childhood, was ridiculous and brought to me by my own uncle. my normal life became a pit of hell. fr the ones who fit their selves in, its never odd...........but it broke me frm inside. though i always wear that mask of normality, but my memory takes me back to the pain i hv felt, the scars get green........................m 20 now.........deep down i know it well that it can't be cured, still i wish there was a single emotion i could get fr real except rage. culprit got married long back and is living a happy life. I could never share it with any1.......except my elder bro who is also a victim of the same. But he grew up to be stronger like never b4.........he is all perfect in his ways........every possible curse got over me only. i can not pretend anymore being hetero. just wanna escape from it all at once. :'( </p>
<h1>GCI- I'm so sorry that it happened with you but atleast try to give your live a better chance at living. The pain is hard to forget but you can. The pain is isn't killing you atleast and what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.</h1>
