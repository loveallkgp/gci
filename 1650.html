<p>Heyy
Just Wanna Confess Something...
I am a model... Earning So much..!! In this Industry all u need is sex, sex and sex.. I am from a liitle town nearby chandigarh.
i am grown up in this industry just becz of sex..!! and i admit it becz its a fact. I had to do this becz i wanna grow. Once, well know person of huge fashion industry called me up in a hotel room and asked me to be naked and have sex with him, and in return offered me a role in the movie. he was around 60s and im 23. But i dint accepted that offer. so wanna ask, was it okay or not ?
I read the confessions of people here. so dats y im posting it here</p>
<h1>Viv- Tell me something which I don't know. Behind all the glamor and shine of the showbiz industry the main driving force is sex. Well according to me you did that right. But then again, you said that you wanted to grow in the industry so you also did sex multiple times. So why there was a sudden change of heart? You had the perfect opportunity to grow more. But each to his own, if you felt right doing it, then its completely fine.</h1>
