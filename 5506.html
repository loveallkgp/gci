<p>(Talk between me and one of my classmates)</p>
<p>"You're so sexy yar" - He said.
"What??" - I was turning all scarlet.
"Hahaha"
"No, I didnt hear you" - I tried to appear less shocked
"I mean you r really hot! Face. Body. everything." He said very slowly.
"Okaayyy... thankyou... I guess." I said sounding casual
"And ass too...hahaha" He laughed again.
"Is it?!" - I smiled .. a forced one..coz I was too shocked to be responding normally.</p>
<p>"Yes. Yes. Smile too. I wish I was half as good-looking as you." He smiled, seriouly.
"Shut up. You're so good-looking yourself!" - I said
"Dont lie just to make me feel good yar. You r soo good that you can get any girl in 1 minute. And...guys too..hahaha" He tried to look into my eyes. I was looking away.
"haha" was all i could force outta myself at that point.</p>
<p><em>silence</em></p>
<p>"She doesnt deserve you. You look way too good to be her boyfriend" - he said again after a painful silence.
"who?"
"(name of a girl)" he said
"For God's sake dude, I've told u sooo many times that I am NOT dating her...or any other girl. Stop linking me with them already." I was little frustrated (really) due to uncalled linkings everyday!
"Hahaha....Liar" - He said staring in my eyes. It was awkard and I diverted my eyes.
"Really, buddy! If I was dating, I'd tell everybody." I said sounding honest.
"Handsome man like u r never single. They r players...like u..hahaha" He laughed while trying to read my expressions.
"Oh yea? Of course Imma player! I have 90 gfs. <em>scarcistic tone</em> And why only girls...I play with dudes too. wanna see how i play? Come I'll kiss you." I stepped ahead to lean towards him in joking manner.</p>
<p>"hahaha..ok!" He said while trying to reach for me. He came too close to me. And then I stepped back.
"Hahha..go away!" I said while pushing his chest away.
"U must be really good kisser btw" He said.
"Shut up!" I said laughing.</p>
<p>And then we laughed it off.

Now, I wanna know from you people... Is He Gay??
He looks good. But i have no feelings like Love for him. I mean, even if he is gay, i have no interest in him, romantically nor sexually. (If I had, I'd have been writing bout my sex experience right now mayb..lol)
so, yea..Is he gay?If yes, Is he into me? If yes, How do I make him know m not into him? (No direct talking please..its awkard) Thank you tons. xo :)</p>
<h1>GCI- If not gay, he is definitely bi-curious or bisexual. Honestly you don't have to do anything to make it more awkward. It has been awkward enough between the two of you. He must have gotten the vibe of "you not being interested in him" from this incident. And there is a question for you- If you are not at all interested in him, does it really matter if he is gay or not and that he is interested in you? If I were you, I wouldn't give a damn.</h1>
