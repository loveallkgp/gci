<p>I am very straight looking n manly guy. I had lot of friends n respect in my college days. I used to stay in our college hostel but.......one day When i was caught having homosex with a junior in my hostel. I was blamed for that alone forced to leave hostel. And suffer all insult n humilation where ever i roam in college. Even my batch mates mad fun of me. When i was wating at cube or walking people used to taunt at me. Even in my mess one boy told what i did. Grauation was most unberable period of my time. It changed my life completely. I dont have a single friend from my college. I was like a kickbag n timpass to taunt. Aft many years i called a best friend of mine fr college. Aft listning my name he told. Who are u i dont know anyone by this name. Never again call me. It still hurts me.....</p>
<h1>GCI- It's better that you don't have any friends from college. You are far better off from people who are negative and have constricted mindset. They can do sex, they can talk about girl parts openly but if some guy has sex with another guy, it is a shame for them. Suddenly their inner saint awakes and they become pure. Feel happy instead, sugar.</h1>
