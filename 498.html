<p>Hey guys!
As a closeted gay, when your straight friends ask you which girl u like, u find attractive, why u dnt hv a gf etc. i just go mum!!
I hv nothing to say at that time!
I just dnt understand what to say!
I can not lie as it will cause MORE questions to be asked, nd i can't say the truth either s a closeted gay, i need some more time to be able to come out.</p>
<p>BUT tb tk, kya kroon? i hv no problems with friends, their questions r legitimate, its quite normal among guys to ask about sex and love life!</p>
<p>But neither can i share, nor do i want to lie nor can i keep mum. Its easily noticeable if i try to divert/change the issue. What to do?</p>
<h1>Viv- Every gay guy's problem it is. When I faced this issue, I used to say that Shakira is my one and only love and I couldn't think beyond her. Nobody questioned me more because I was the first one there to go for an international artist because all others were stuck with Miss Pooja. The other diversion you could go for is asexuality. Take your diversion beyond their understanding level and you will surely be comfortable with that situation</h1>
