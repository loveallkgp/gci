<p>It was the beginning of 2012. The past 18 months had been very tough for me, lost some near and dear ones. I was going through mood swings, I was alone, I needed someone to hold on to. Then he suddenly came into my life, Ritwik. I was overwhelmed and overjoyed- that typical felling when youngsters come out of the shell of singleness. It was not because I found someone to cuddle or do cheesy stuff with, it was simply because I could finally talk to someone, express my thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>Things were going into utopia and I was starting to believe in it. Sometimes, utopian thoughts are worse than nightmares because we are so deceived by them that we move far away from the ground of reality. The first thing that brought about a disparity in opinion was the question of "coming out" to our parents and family. To me it was nothing but facing a harsh moment of truth. Ritwik believed in the concept of hypocrisy. He wanted to get married to a girl, have kids and indulge in adultery with me. I decided to stick to my principles- truth and only, truth.</p>
<p>The rift that grew due to this one thing started worsening everything between us. I was positive that I would be able to turn things round. But I was wrong. There was someone else playing in the background- another guy, Nilambar. I tried not to be the over-possessive type and I succeeded. But I could definitely sense that things were falling apart. We faced loads of ups and downs in the following months when I was ignored in the worst possible way- phone calls unanswered, texts not replied to, no communication through social media. I was verbally abused in the harshest ways possible.</p>
<p>This incident taught me that moving on is required when we are at the dead ends of the road. This failed relationship was the reason that I finally meet "The One". This hell of a relationship proved how strong I was from inside and I was capable of replying back. I learnt that "To Forgive and Forget" is as unrealistic as possible. Forgetting the scars is not easy. And there is no question of Forgiving substandard, filthy, hypocritical liars.</p>
<p>So, that was narrating an episode. Where is the confession? Here it comes. The names I mentioned here are made-up. I confess that in the near future I will expose this hell of a hypocrite to his family and others. Sweet revenge!!! </p>
<h1>GCI- Oh well.... I was gonna say something sympathetic but now, damn boy.. you are on fire! Give me bitch 5!</h1>
