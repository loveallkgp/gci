<p>When I'll come home from work, she'll run, yelling "Daddy", into my arms and I'll kiss on her forehead after giving her the brightest smile of the day. She'd obviously make all of the tiredness go away as soon as I'll see her smile.
Life would be pretty interesting with my little princess. :)
This is probably one of the few intense dreams I have so far in 18 years of life - having a daughter!
But then later a realization hit me. For having a daughter, I need a wife. WIFE?? Me?? NO !!! 
I won't marry. That's for sure. I can't give any girl more than that 'sisterly love' and so I don't wanna ruin any girl's life. I am NOT one of those pretenders !
You might argue why not adopt a baby..or have surrogacy or any other such technology.. but trust me I thought about it and the idea was not that appealing to me :(
Its not like I have a problem with them..I just don't feel like going for them. But maybe in future I can consider them - I guess 18 is a young age to think about all these stuff.</p>
<p>But what m saying is..somehow that dream of having a cute little doll of mine has gone too far from me. The name I'd thought for her will always be in my mind - even if I don't have a daughter ! :) :)</p>
<h1>GCI : i get it ... you might be having that feeling that why a stranger be surrogate. so many think that ..like i don't know her , i don't like her and i don't wanna her to be biological mother of my kid.</h1>
<p>so that's normal .. you know surrogate mother can be chosen from known  females .. like a female best friend if she is ready . or you can have adopt a child from your own family if any couple agrees ... maybe of your own sibling .this way you will feel more comfortable .</p>
