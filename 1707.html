I sometimes pinch his cheeks :D He hugs me everytime coz for him I am the only good friend.:) I is toooo lazy and I always keep updating about all class schedule, assignments and all those degree stuffs :) Everytime I make it a point to xerox an extra copy of notes for him. Even I have wrote his assignments and I feel happy for doing his job :) I call him daily and wake him , # He is too lazy lad :p He is too reserved and he has a girl friend too. :) Quite jealous about tat :( But anyhow I want to confess tat even though I know I cant get him in my life , I Just LOVE his Adorable EYES and EYE LASHES .
