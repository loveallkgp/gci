<p>My first relationship was for some 3 years and it( the guy) broke up nearly 4 years ago. I was in depression for straight 1 year and since 3 years I have been putting up a fight and have technically moved on. I am currently doing decent in career and studies, though introvert but not depressed over the particular fact now. I walked into second relationship some 3 years ago but it never felt the same. ... On various grounds, including our mental understanding and sex. And we are now to breakup! I am unable to feel the same pain. It makes me feel good and uneasy at the same time. 
I have now decided to stay single unless someone miraculously enters my life, I don't want to materialize the relationship, which I have been unknowingly doing after my first breakup. 
I am confused, do I have fear of intimacy? Commitment issues? Am I now focused on material part of it or have I just eventually grown up. .!? 
P. S : I request comments from personal experience. Will I be able to love again? Or is it altogether unnecessary?</p>
<h1>GCIL- Well here goes the lecture then. Hope you have the patience to read it.</h1>
<p>1- The problem here is there was NO PROBLEM at all after you had moved on, but you chose not to let go of the false hope of romanticism that it will make you and shape you in the way you want. Clearly it doesn't and you wasted your time in 'moving on' with a charade and made it quite fake.</p>
<p>2- Your confession makes me assume that you must be in your late twenties now. And this my lad is a tough period for gay men or the people with a broken past. The thing to remember here is that nothing is left unchecked in our world- not even the feelings or emotions we choose to ignore. The result- Either you must attend to your psyche and see what is piled up or plainly delete your psychological garbage bin and become a whole new person again.</p>
<p>3- Sorry laddie but there are no miracles of someone whooshing your life with a love wand. The potion of love is not made with what you want but from what you are and what you will be.</p>
<p>4- You have actually made a hole in your heart by allowing urself to  treat him( ur present and soon-to-be-ex guy) as a means to getting rid of the burden of love. YES, the burden, because you led urself to believe that you were weak enough to not let love heal you without that person in ur life.</p>
<p>5- Mate you have grown up, but with a false implication of being an adult. When we become adult we tend to be more specific and precise. And that requires not wasting your or anyone's precious years where your actions might have a negative repercussion in the future of that person.</p>
<p>6- It is solely your own quest to understand the issues of intimacy and commitment because we can just become a beacon for you here. The path is yours and yours alone to tread.</p>
<p>7- Love may not be materialistic but has many or all the attributes of consumerism today. So don't bug urself up on that. But one thing here- Do not make it an item to cherish highly or discard all totally....today it lies somewhere in between these two vortexes.  </p>
<p>8- One important thing here is to highlight is your inner preferences for sex, understanding, intimacy quotient and sexuality. The crux here is simple- Unearth your soul first and then think of becoming a prince charming...u may never know what demons might have grown in your garden of long lost love.</p>
<p>9- Depression is a pretty bad state and people do a lot of shitty things when it has engulfed us. Try to unravel those points where you felt that why you were depressed in the first place and what cause and chain effect you may have started.</p>
<p>10- YES, you may have the luck to love again provided it chooses you again for making something different out of you this time.
But do not forget that love is many things and yet it remains neutral if we just know when not to 'love-ify' our lives unnecessarily with it.</p>
<p>I hope that suffices your questions!</p>
