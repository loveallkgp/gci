<p>Are there any teen gays in India, 'Openly gay"- I very much doubt that but not even the hidden ones, I wish I could meet an emo guy , I am 20 and look 18</p>
<p>I am in the mood of leaving this Godforsaken country, I am a law student and I know 4 languages, hope one day I get to live in a cool country somewhere in Europe,
Amsterdam &lt;3
And do not attack me patriots, It's a very old concept, We don't own any country, It's just a piece of land, always was and always will be, just because a lot of noble and respected people sacrificed their life for its independence doesn't mean we have to limit ourselves by our country's and it's people's small mindedness and faliures.
We should all assemble and go to Amsterdam and have a sick party, one which we can't have here in India, sure there are gay bares and stuff but it sucks compared to the good stuff
In India bars are like Hidden, as if we are criminals, Hell even the straight bars are not that open, you would find them on the third floor or the basement of some shady building, except some ofcourse :)</p>
<p>come'on I will show u the way around, know a lot about Amsterdam, Belgium and France :)</p>
