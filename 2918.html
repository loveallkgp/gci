<p>I do not know whether I am  gay or bi. Its getting harder &amp; more stressful day by day.
I am worried - will I be able to sustain marriage with a girl ? I cannot postpone this any longer now that time will tell etc..</p>
<p>I am sure about my attractions for guys - not all of them, I have my type. I can feel who are hot, sexually appealing etc. but I am not sure about my attractions with girls. I can feel which girl looks beautiful according to me but I can't determine hotness / sexual attractiveness for girls.</p>
<p>I enjoy straight porn where the guy has to be hot. Although I enjoy guy indulging in normal sexual activities with girl. </p>
<p>I have tried full sex with both genders and it was satisfactory more or less.</p>
<p>May be I m more towards guys but I cannot determine whether I can consider the "Less" part (girls) as sufficient enough for lasting marriage if at all if it exists.</p>
<p>I know our society won't accept homosexuality openly - so if I can be some happy with girl and have good marriage I will control my feelings for men just like I have been doing.</p>
<p>Somebody please advice.</p>

<h1>Admin, you are doing very good job - Kudos !</h1>
<h1>GCI : see like you have told you get attraction to men more but you are attracted to women too , then in general defination you are a bi-sexual . but if you don't want to tag yourself with tag bi ... you don't have to be . so many people in world don't like to tag themselves as stereotypical definations of sexual preferences .</h1>
<p>and if you recently came to know about such attractions then it can be hard for you to accept yourself as bi or gay . its a psychological shock .. it takes time to recover and to be normal only then you will be able to decide . </p>
<p>right now you are just 24 , so young .if you are deciding to marry i would say please wait for another 4 years . date guys and girls ... try to explore your comfort level with both , listen to yourself .. free your mind from peer pressure , social standards of marriage , relationship, normal , love and try to accept the results . accepting yourself is more important . </p>
<p>see once you marry a girl then their is no going back , ofcourse their is going back .. i mean you can divorce her but what is the use of it . destroying a girls hurt , putting yourself in judgement .. loyalty is must in a married life .</p>
<p>just figure things out then decide something . you got plenty of time .</p>
