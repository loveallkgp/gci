<p>I am 23 mumbai bottom and want to share my love story with a guy since 2 months. We met at a bus stop every night when I came back from office. I knew he was that type too since he used to stare at me and sometimes make tongue gestures. Slowly i used to sit close and put my hand on his lap and he used to cover it with his bag. Then I used to put my handkerchef on it and shake him till he came. That way we used to openly love in public. However since last week I don't see him on bus stop. I don't have his contact details or even his name. We didn't get a chance to talk since there were people around. I am scared now and don't want to lose my love.</p>
<h1>GCI- How is that a love story? That's more like a "not getting a room to shag" story.</h1>
