<p>Well guys... I wanna confess smthng... I ws not born with a silver spoon... I hv managed to get scholarship(partial) for my studies from class 10 onwards... Now m doin a professional course in a gov't college in Kolkata... But my semester fees r quite high... Nearly 40k.. My parents can't provide me that sum of money... I've done male escorting to get money... Cause i tried many other jobs but it's not possible to continue with my course... One of my friend knew about it... Today he told me that i m a whore(he's correct) nd m cheap guys.. At least he don't sleep with any tom,dick and harry... It's for him... I m not ashamed of what i do... It takes guts to do it nd confess it... U r a born with dollars in ur ass.. But trust me bitch I'll be on one day... M doin all this crazy shitz to complete my studies... And i don't give a fuck what u think... ND yes.. I won't mind to be harry Louis... Be a pornstar.. Earn in euros and be with my partner happily... 18, Kolkata </p>
<h1>GCI : see being a pornstar on your own will or for a temporary time is okay . but why pornstar ... i mean you can be gay stripper , pole dancer or exotic dancer  where you won't have to sleep with somebody  and money is quite good in this field too ....  as you want it temporarily to support yourself financially . ( just telling from his point . not really giving ideas )</h1>
<p>and harry louis is no longer pornstar he has left the porn industry last year . being a pornstar isn't easy either . but come on .. you are studying right now so focus on your study ... porn is last thing to do but try luck in your present career for which you are studying . ain't nothing wrong with pornstars .. its work . </p>
<p>one more thing ( if you aren't born with silver spoon , buy one ) .
but again .... their are million things before porn ... porn is for people who can't get high marks or don't like studying or basically have no other talent . then go to porn .porn is last  natural talent,</p>
