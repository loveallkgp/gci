<p>It's been 4Years 2months and 15 days,
I still remember the worst day of mah life when he called me and Said, Asad I'm getting married to a girl and Now we can't continue our relationship,
I didn't know what to do,
I thought everything has finished, After A while I tried to have Relationships with guys, I was not able to forget him,
I also tried to have sex with some guys, Nobody can Make me as comfortable as He always Do...
It has been So Long,
I don't know where is he,
I don't know what is he doing,
All I know is I'm not able to forget u,
All I know is I still love u...
My situations are making me Meera Bai 
Admin Plzz Help me out what I should Do to Move on....</p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmm...ok Meera tera dard main jaan gaya.</h1>
<p>Now listen very carefully, just allow someone to create a new kind of benchmark of love in ur life and do the same for him without following any of the old parameters that were connected to him.</p>
