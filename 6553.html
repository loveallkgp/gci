<h1>GCI- This is a serious case of bullying and sexual harassment. First of all, your boyfriend is an asshole. Fuck him.</h1>
<p>I want you to play with them. Try resisting them when they force you. Get some proof of their activity. Take those proofs and complain to the college authority. Do not hide the details from authorities. It is about your life. Text me back in inbox. I want to have one on one conversation with you. In the meantime I will try and get some guidelines from other people.</p>
