<p>am getting negitive feelings whenever i think what will be supreme court's next decision. I don't think they are going to decriminalize gay sex.  i know i can do sex and be a gay but somewhere i will feel that whatever i am doing is illegal. i know sex between two consensual adults is not a sin but still...</p>
<p>what you will do if supreme court won't decriminalize gay sex? </p>
<ul>
<li>i love you guys
       illegaly*</li>
</ul>
<h1>GCI : to be frank i don't have any expectations from government and homophobic idiots ... even if they make it legal chances are majority of homophobes , religious groups will start marches against it .</h1>
<p>but the things is lgbt people sooner or later have to fight for it . its not easy battle... its do or die.  blackmail government , throw stones ,  make rallies , go to jails for indecent exposure of gay love , marry illegally ..... just get your rights anyway .</p>
<p>i don't remember the name of movie ... but it was awesome where a gay journalist starts gay revolution in america . it was act of bravery and finally after lot of deaths of innocents gays during rallies they get the gay rights . anybody who know the movie do tell its name ... and everyone must watch it .</p>
