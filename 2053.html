<p>I had a friend with anxiety disorder.
He only shared this problem with me.The very movement I decided to help him in everyway I can.
Eventually Love devoloped in me.and I was very obsessed about him.I lost even 8 kgs in his love.My bday is on dec 13 and his is on dec 20.But I waited for his birthday more than mine.I presented him a personality devolopment book with all the money I was able to save.( because his psychiatrist asked him to read such books.)
But this was all one sided.He did not feel the same though he regarded me as a bestest friend in his life in the later period.but he was just using me.and fooling me. Like whenever I helped him he used to be close for that movement and later ignored me.He didnt wait for me while leaving to home from college none of the things that a best friend has to do.But I always craved for him.Later one day we had a fight and I moved apart.
But I was unable to stay that way.I was literally begging him to talk to me but he didnt even give fuck.Only my pillows know how much I used to cry in the nights.
One day there was a debate compitition in the class.He tried to talk but he was unable to manage (as he was having anxiety disorder.)I noticed that and started taking his side.
He came and thanked me.But he said thank u does nt mean I am going to talk to you.
Another friend of mine said to him not to overact now and take everything easy.Then he removed block on facebook and asked me to send request( Asked me to send req but he didnt send)
I was very happy to start talking to him again.I sent a message to him but wat I recieved was "dont even expect tht its going to be same again"Every time he said I was only acting and that I should be given Oscar for my acting.
I finally realised that I was investing in a wrong person and started moving on.But even then I used to help him whenever he needed.( Its reflex action one cant control like a mother saves her baby)
One fine day that was his bday he invited me and started talking as if nothing has happened.I was just being polite.Later he asked me to sit beside him and that it will give him comfort otherwise he feels anxious.I dont want all this to happen again but it happened again.
He started saying that he loves me a lot and not to leave him even if he tried to break up.
and whatever I do will always be right and that he feels guilty for whatever he did.
But readers are you expecting happily ever after?
NO HE NEVER CHANGED AND HE IS REPEATING THE SAME.AND NOW I DONT EVEN LOVE HIM ANYMORE.but once you fall in love with someone its hard to stay single again.Your heart always craves for warmth..</p>
<h1>GCI- Keeping his disorder issue aside, you will really get nothing if you be with him. Why don't you go a bit hard on him? Let him taste the dish of his own flavor. Say it on his face "even if i am talking to you, do not expect the help from me." Honestly, jitna daboge log utna dabayenge. APni self respect ke liye kabhi na kabhi muh faad ke bolna parhta hai. Otherwise people just come and crush you.</h1>
