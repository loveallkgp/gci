<p>Hey 20 male kolkata .. few days back I posted a confession about a guy that I met on pr and how I fell in love with him. I confessed it to him .. but he is like I believe in NSA.. he hasn't even said me his real name .. I have told him everything about me.. we meet near his workplace and we go to have fun in a flat that he has. I love him truly (I believe). I think of him the whole day, he never calls me only I do so. Please help me guys I am going mad after him. Viv Abby guys plz plz plz help me.. I am getting frustrated please tell me what shall I do that he kind of starts giving me importance or love me ... eeeeee.. </p>
<h1>Viv- Is it just me or does anybody else think that this guy is being used just for sex? You want to gain attention? Stop calling him and stop meeting him. Maybe he will himself call you and start asking about you. But just so you know, you are going bonkers over him. And that, my dear, had him on the superior level. So, you are just like a vermin for him. Now, do you want to be a vermin? Gain some self respect buddy, and treat him the same.</h1>
