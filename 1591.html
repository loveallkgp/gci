<p>M the confessor of 1555 , 86 n now 1587...I dont live in india..I dont have to bother abt the society.. I feel guilt weneva I think of my parents...I feel like betrayin them..its almost 4 years now m out.. n 1.5 yrs in a relationship. . But m bound to internal guilt... yeah I dont considered being gay child means a spoiled child but parents as alwaz will blame themselves for mah sexuality. . They'll think its their fault...I donno wat m gonna do wen they will ask for marriage.. one more thing my past mistakes has made mah relation with mom n dad vulnerable. .yeah they wont say anythin to me but I know they gonna cry like like hell.. I cant see tears in mah mom's eye.. she dont deserve tears.... I donno wat else to say.. I can be strong one day the other day m weak n troubled ((</p>
<p>$ABBY : see as human beings we are meant to go through these situations . .. where we have to choose between our happines and family's happiness . now listen to me ( so many will disagree but i don't give rat's ass) your parents they will die one day ( which is truth man has expiry date ) , your siblings they will leave you when they get married and have their own families .... then here you are left ... who will be there for you ' your partner ' . yeah your partner .... today for parents happiness you can marry a girl for sure but once they are gone and you 50 years old would you be happy being with a girl ???? would you be able to undo the mistakes of past ?? would you be happy of life you never wanted ??? your kids will always think you as straight man , you wife will too ... but just think in emotions one day you just decide to 'come out of closet' what will that put your family into ??? you will disappoint family once  .. you have to .. either today ur parents or later if you marry a  girl ... ( your to be family ) .se parents will be unhappy , mom will cry ( even my mom will too ) ... but its just human nature when all of sudden a shocke comes into our life its way to endure that pressure . we cry , we stay sad , we don't talk ..... but as days pas we try to understand, we get courage , we try to figure things out and we think about it again and again and then we accept it .  see when a person really near to you or from family passes away ... it puts whole family in deep sadness ... but after time thelife goes on . thats what life is. and don't feel guilt .... being gay is not your family fault and not your fault ... and being gay isn't a fault either . its just our parents don't know this thing ... but they can be educated . 
or still oif you care you can marry or you can just tell your parents that you don't want to marry ( when they ask ) .. some compromises hav e to me made .... but see you can delay the distruction but it will sure come not today then tomorrow and will distroy even more if comes later . just think ..of the peace which comes after distruction .</p>
