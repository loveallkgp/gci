<p>after more than two year on fb(fake id),pr and grindr 
i realized guys frm 17 to 20 (student) who r looking for mature uncles manly 30+. 
i can understand some of those really have feeling for mature uncles
but some guys looking for uncles so that they can pay bill and expenses 
i think its also prostitution.
what do u think comment below.</p>
<h1>GCI : most of these teen guys just have sexual attraction to more mature guys ( for married men , uncles ) maybe coz of their fantasies ... its like adventure to them ... its pleasurable , its crazy and fun . its something they can boast in their friend circle. hanging out with a grown up man who has car , who could give them expensive gifts ( like they give to girls .. yeah every gay guy fancy dating , hotel sex once in their life time )  .</h1>
<p>at the same time some teens do have their money needs . many of them are from middle class families but to show off in their friends they need more money , so many of them try to approach married unsatisfied men who will do / pay  them to have sex with them . </p>
<p>even jobless guys are nowadays asking for money on pr and fb as ' PAID SEX' . i won't call it prostitution . prostitution is selling sex to anybody on the other hand these guys choose themselves the person they want to have sex with , and they are not always offering sex , some are offering 'sexy massage' , blow jobs , hand jobs . 
in west these jobs like ' gigolos ', 'strippers' , massuers' ,' porn' are part of jobs and provide many jobless people a secure job .</p>
