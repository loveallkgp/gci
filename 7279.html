<p>This a is story of a feminine guy who has been harassed in school time n till he is 21 yrs.  now. Its been 2days ago 1 guy harassed this guy in his tution. This guy has complaint to his teacher against the idiom. He requested to outcast that idiom from the class but the teacher did not do it he  just appped him twice.
This feminine guy follow this page from the begining but its his first confession.
He belong from bihar.
People are here very conservative so he cant came out to society.
In bihar there is no lgbt campaign has been started.
Earlier this guy tried to change his feminine attitude but some time somehow it refelects to others n get bashed from others.
This guy has found that being feminine is nothing wrong but judging others is wrong like sin.</p>
<h1>GCI- A hug from our side and keep working on ur persona and ur life will automatically change one day...</h1>
<p>P.S- Feminine guys are bold and cannot charade...that is the problem which the society cannot tackle with them and makes them sissy and cowardly by inducing the seeds of self hate and self pity in them..I hope u will work on the kind of person u want to become. 
Dhyan rakhna apna bachhe!
And do try to learn meanings in English...angrezi itni bhi muhskil nhi h beta..buss tense, verb or degrees of comparison ka base strong karlo...galtiyaan kam karoge!</p>
