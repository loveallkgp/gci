<p>My confession is that I love staring at cute guys on the roads. A few weeks ago while I was driving with my mom, I saw a really cute guy and couldn't take my eyes off him. Our eyes met and I continued looking at him. The pavement where he was walking was uneven and he tripped, but didn't fall. I was so glad that he didn't fall, I completely forgot that I was driving and was about hit a car in front. Fortunately I braked in time. (I really gotta give up this habit when driving before I cause some major damage.) I think my mom noticed what was going on.
Ever since this incident, my mom points out random girls on the street and asks me if I would like a bride like that? (She never did this earlier.) I keep telling her that I'm not interested in marriage and that i'm gonna be a bachelor. But she never accepts that. Every time she does this, I come a step closer to coming out to her. I really don't want it to happen so soon, I want to become financially stable before coming out.</p>
<h1>GCI- So don't let your emotions weigh you down. Put a control of over your mum and if she still doesn't stop, start ignoring her. She clearly got a hint.</h1>
<p>PS- That looking at guys while driving, it happens with me too. -_-</p>
