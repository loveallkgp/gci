<p>Hi evryone this is Kritika Singh,19years old student by profession,male by sex,female by gender transgender by identity,striaght by sexuality,u might hv seen me many times commenting on GIC's post lol</p>
<p>I live as a guy nobody knows abt my real identity of being a transgender so i do hv experience of both lives n still i experience the same as a gay n transgender both bcz i m full guy for society so wanna share n suggest smthng frm my experience here with evryone</p>
<p>Well this is my first confesssion here on GIC and i have two things to say to all my gay and bisexual friends here.First thing let haters hate bcz God loves us.</p>
<p>Being Gay means being happy so stay happy cheerful n keep smile on face bcz god's blessings are with LGBT community.Human discrminate us not god bcz the meaning of GodAcceptsYou(GAY)</p>
<p>secondly i want to say abt those bisexuals and gay guys who would end up getting married with genetic girls n having an affair post-marriage just to hide their sexuality n continue enjoying it.I mean its a matter of shame agree or disagree bt fact is fact.Sexuality isn;t a choice bt being courageous or coward is which we chose to be.</p>
<p>I have some thing to say for those gay or bisexual guys n even Lesbian and bisexual girls i hv come across in life who want to marry a girl/guy in future.. And for those who think that guy can't love another guy or can't live with another guy as couple... just fuck off... u can have sex with guys why can't u fall in love with a guy...</p>
<p>Think about it.. if you are planning to marry a girl then you will only be responsible for killing here hopes and faith from life.. every girl grows up struggling secondary treatment in her family and puts all the dream with her husband... being a guy you won't be able to satisfy her... i am not talking about sex here marriage is more than sex... she won't be able to get emotional attachment and love from you... she will have to live all her life like this burying all the dreams in her heart..</p>
<p>Just for pleasing your parents and society you are using an innocent life. Do you think God will forgive you? or can you forgive yourself?</p>
<p>Now think if that girl is your sister and she is getting married to a gay guy, how you'd feel??? ANSWER YOUR SELF...!!!!!!!</p>
<p>or put urself in the place of that girl n imagine ur biggest dream shattering in no time how would u feel ? ur 2 yrs relationship breaks u go into depression get sad for years then the dream which evry girl sees since childhood ,hw could u play with someone's dream ? hw could u be so selfish just to make ur family happy u cheat on otherperson ? wt would be her fault ?? Hw would u feel if u hv relationshp with a guy n he sleeps with another guy or u come to knw he sleeps with girl ? Think n decide</p>
