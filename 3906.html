<p>I look very stupid, so whenever I chat with someone and they ask me for my photograph I send them but they block me...probably because I look so ugly. Frankly speaking, I am sooo ugly that people don't even like to look at me...My sister once told me that whenever her friends arrive at home, It'd be better if I go out or stay inside a room and bolt tge door. My cousin once came to our house for few days of stay and he told me on the day 1 that it'd better if i don't come in front of him when he wakes up in morning. so you know, I just stopped expecting hamdsome partner in my love but even those gays who didn't look good, they ignored me. Now I think that I won't get any partner in future.  I don't like when people stare at me So I cover my face whenever I go outside. I remember, once I went to stay at my cousin's home and he asked me to put that cover all times. It was so inconvinient, I had to cover my face all 24 hours. My cousins and siblings are so rude. you know, they say your mind needs to be beautiful, not your outside appearance but it's wrong, today's generation only cares for your face not what you think.</p>
