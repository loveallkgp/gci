<p>Words of Displeasure.
Hereby I confess that the past few minutes was a total ignorance and an insult to religion here in this group. Certain things are taken as 'joke' but God should not be a joke or the matter to be mock at.
For this reason I blame the admin and would like to request him not to repeat this in future because such reasons can lead to further classifications about religion in the society. 
Our great freedom fighters have brought and made us together as one and let no man seperate our unity. And with utmost sincerity I state that this group be a common platform where people can excercise their thoughts freely with hurting each other feelings.
P.s. I was brought to the notice that various insult to religion is going about here. We want unity not classification.
Long live GCI.</p>
<h1>GCI : is god somebody's personal property .  i want to take god as gay , lesbian , a sex god , or even as a drag its my will . if some people can make poetries on god , present him so perfect ..why can't they take a joke on him</h1>
<p>see you can either hate my page or like it the way it is . their is no need to reflect a politically correct stance and shower your conditional praises on us . god hates liers and you will be punished for that ...</p>
<p>and after putting so many rules on us you are talking about exersicing free thoughts and not hurting others feelings . </p>
<p>well your confession has hurted my feelings ..deeply .</p>
