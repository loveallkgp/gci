<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I am in a relationship wd my bf from last 3 yrs.We love each other a lot and meet only once in a week.After my responsibilities for my family (my parents) are over. I plan to stay wd my bfie at my place.But will it be easy to stay wd him at my place.My locality is a very conservative locality.PPl see me in very bad manner, whenever they see me wd my bfie.Even my siblings too stay dey wont allow me to stay wd my bfie at my own home.My parents also many times suggest me to keep meetings wd my bfie limited as in India most of ppl are homophobic and with emergence of BJP and RSS, ppl can do anything wrong wd both of us.I really thrive to stay wd my bf , i miss him a lot and feel incomplete without him.Meeting once a week is too little for me but i am ok with this arrangment for my parents sake.Guys pls suggest me how is it possible for us to stay together after my parents are no more and how to tackle this homophobic society, dese gujjar and RSS ppl.
Waiting for your suggestions.</p>
<h1>GCI- Its sick indeed when society takes the charge of how two people should live. Let them look the way they want. You can give them a look too. Its not like they are perfect that they look down upon you. It is funny when people have their lives messed up but always want to poke into other's life to complain about problems.</h1>
<p>And to hell with BJP and RSS. Let them say whatever they want. They should not have a control over anyone for that matter. They and their right wing views can stay out other people's lives and bedrooms.</p>
