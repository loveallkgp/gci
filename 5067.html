<p>18, Sapiosexual , Closeted , Clueless about life</p>
<p>Its liberating to tell someone that I'm gay , be it a bunch of random strangers on this page . I am deep in closet and its evident from the fact that I havent even liked this page , even tough I check it regularly .
As proud as I am being a homosexual , life would have been 1000 times easier if I were straight . I hail from a middle class family and I just refuse to just go about being a slut and have sex with any random dickhead life throws at me . What I want to ask people is that why is it so hard in this country to just meet some friend out there ? Like someone decent who doesnt go about talking in "U luk so seXy " language . Why is it so hard that we indians have created barriers amongst ourselves and all that we have on shitty websites is sex sex sex . I have been offered to have sex with 10 guys on varying sites but none who'd be interested in knowing me as a person .
It sickens me to know that most gays in this country , just want to objectify me and get a blowjob (okay maybe i am good at bjs , so what ?) or fuck me .
I know people will be commenting like Asexual and stuff but hello !!! IM NOT ASEXUAL , i just want a good person to be with , someone who takes time out to appreciate me and not my hole .
My writing shows what a bundle of nerves I am but going forward , why doesnt any decent (English speaking , funny , intelligent , no worries much about the looks ) guy want to be with me ? And if there exists someone , exclusively for me (Like drama camp , ............ add some random gay movies here ) , how do I go about finding him ?</p>
<p>Admin , I have confided in you , it'd be great if you could please keep my identity confidential .</p>
