<p>Hi again kritika this side and today got many msgs today,Happy Independence Day?? really??</p>
<p>Which human rights we are talking about as an indivdual when we have no right on our own body or to tell others who we are but others have right on my body and identity to tell who we are and how to use our genitals.Living in slavery frm the day we are born just bcz our feelings are diffrnt and not same like majority,being discrminiated from the day we come out and be ourselves.This is the realty of a world's largest democratic country.Again would few lines here which i read on page Being Indian and other pages which many of you have read it earlier few ironies of India.</p>
<p>From legal aspects.</p>
<p>1.We live in a country where seeing a policeman makes us nervous rather than feeling safe.
2.Politicians Divide us, Terrorists Unite us.
3.Reserved people get more benefit than deserve people...!
4.Your feelings and identity is diffrnt from majority and there is a whole complete article which makes you criminal and others get full right to discrminate you,where is the privicy and protection right that our constitution talks about ?
5.India,a country,where rich people get justic easily whereas poors struggle,specially when the case is limited to police stations bcz of the bribe being given.
6.India follows the law sec 377,given by britishers long back,britishers removed it for the sake of their citizen's right but india still follows it and calls it our cultre?? lol
7.Girls have right to do changes in their desired body part,like silicon implant,plastic surgeory,threading,enhancement surgeries and many more but still Transgender people faces criticism when it comes to change their body,thats equality?
8.Where Harsh action is taken against people for hate speech even for smaller things if you are big politician or Bollywood celebrity,but no action against Gay,Fem guys and transgender,where worst terms used to humiliate them,protectors protecting themselves not us,same applies on other common people not just LGBT</p>
<p>From Society aspects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Indian Society teaches 'Not to Get Raped', rather 'Don't Rape'! which includes many of our rulers.
2,A porn-star is accepted in society as a celebrity,
but a rape victim is not even accepted as a normal human being.
3.We rather spend more on our daughter's wedding than on her education.
4.Most people who fight over Gita and Quran, have probably never read any of them.</li>
<li>Priyanka Chopra earned more money playing Mary Kom, then Mary Kom earned in her entire career.</li>
<li>Its dangerous to talk to strangers, but it's perfectly ok to marry one.
7.Where girls are told to wear proper clothes,doesn't matter if guys are nude.
8.Indian parents want their child to stand our in a crowd but manyexpect them to do what crowd is doing.
9.Our country where sayings like "Ladki ghar ki laxmi hoti hai" and ""Ladki baap ka bojh hoti hai" coexists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry if it offends to anyone's patriotic feeling ,its just another normal day for me though i love my country and ppl where i m born and will always be but can't keep aside the idiotic things happening in laws and societies :)
Think over it deeply once be it LGBT people or other,applies on evry common-man of this country.</p>
