<p>I am out of the closet to my friends and my family. While my parents don't accept it, my sisters and friends are all okay with it.
I don't have a problem to be answered. I just don't have anyone to say this to. You see, they all say that it doesn't affect them, that I'm gay, but all of them say to me that I'll eventually turn straight and fall for a girl. I don't want to be bothered by it but I still am bothered by it. My friends don't care about me being gay, well that's what they say. As much as they try to hide it they're still noticeably uncomfortable with it. And I sometimes wish I had a friend in real life who could either relate to or not be bothered by my sexuality.</p>
<h1>GCI : totally your work is done here . you wanted to tell people and you told them . they don't want to accept this thing is theirs decision . i don't blame your parents , to them this thing is new . they think that you are young and just going through phase of life and one day ( because of peer pressure you will do compromise and marry a girl )</h1>
<p>prove them wrong , darling . </p>
<p>but i respect them for not beating you or forcing you to marry a girl . if they haven't accepted yet maybe they will when you will be running your own family one day .</p>
