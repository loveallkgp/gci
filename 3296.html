<h1>gci- Don't blame yourself until someone blames you please. Maybe they have some problems that can't be solved. I don't think it has anything to do with you being gay. If it was, they'd be disowning you. But that's bad that your parents are getting divorce. It never turns out good for the kids.</h1>
