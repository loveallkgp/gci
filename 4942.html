<p>Hi everyone
I know this is kinda stupid but here it goes...
I went to a store a few days ago to buy some stuff.Since it was chilling i decided to walk up there(took around 20 mins).The owner then directed me to his employee to help me out.As he turned around sipping a cup of coffee,my exact thoughts were like"Holy crap Damn u r hot".But me being me,i didnt even take a second glance at him although i put on a smiling face.As i was trying to choose my items,he asked me if i was giving tutions nearby.I ofcourse replied in the negative n told him that i was pursuing my postgraduation.I also found out that it was his part time job n dat he is also a graduate student.I tried to delay my stay there as long as possible n surprisingly he too kept on indulging me in his talks.Whenever other customers came,he would either go to them n help dem out quickly n come talking to me or shout to his coworkers to help dem.He had this different desi accent(unlike the jaat type accent which, no offense,always seems kind of arrogant to me) which was really sexy.He was so cute that i wanted to kill myself(lol).
Well,reminiscing about what happened,he asking me,a 21 yr old NE guy if i was giving tutions in delhi was kind of lame n sweet.
I know its a long shot but assuming u r gay or bisexual n if u happen to read,all i wanna say is"Dude i wanna date u"
Any advice people????</p>
