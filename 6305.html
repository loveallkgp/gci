<p>I m living together with my bf since 2 years . I m 20 n he is 25. he is working and m a student so i m dependant on my parents for money but we share our rent/food in equal bcz i dont want to be burden on him.So last month my wallet was lost with 8k and i was left with little money to pay rent. ab ek mahine me 8k kahan se lata papa ko bolta to bhut kuch sunne milta so i have sex with 4-5 uncles n i paid my share of rent now m feeling very guilty. Kya krta me? agr use bolta ki i hv lost so may be use lgta m doing drama to get escaped :( or meko burden sochne lgta wo. I love him n i did nt enjoy any of sex wd uncle.I love him a lot :) should i tell him or this? i cant live wd this guilt :( </p>
<h1>GCI- Well if you can't live with this guilt then you should tell him. But I do want to point out a few things. You are imagining things. Loosing a wallet is an accident and a terrible one, so why do you think that your father would have scolded you? Plus how much your bf loves you? Is it so less that he could have thought of this accident as a mere drama and started considering you a burden? You need to think of what people would really think who are close to you and not just imagine things.</h1>
