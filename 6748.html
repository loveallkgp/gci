<p>I feel so disgusted, so vulnerable. Today our group was hanging out, we were joking around &amp; then one thing led to another, &amp; I was on the ground pinned down by a male friend. I am a female btw. He was showing how easy it is to get a woman down &amp; rape her. I did try to push him away, I scratched him, tried biting him, even aimed for his balls, but all of it went in vain, he was all over me, laughing. Nobody took it as more than a joke, but my mind couldn't grasp the fact that I was so easily pinned down. I thought I was stronger. Why am I so weak then? Any man can come, pin me down, &amp; rape me, &amp; I can't do anything. Why am I so disgusting, so weak? &amp; you know what's the worst part? After this staged act he asked if I was a little turned on, he had a boner! I am not even mad at him or anyone anymore, I'm just sad I couldn't stop it. He is a friend, a nice guy most of the time, &amp; it was definitely a joke, but it doesn't make me feel any better.. </p>
<h1>GCI- See sister many countries in the world teach their boys that men are superior in everything and RAPE CULTURE exists in many part of the world as in AFRICAN countries so as to say.</h1>
<p>U being pinned down by a man is the very notion of patriarchal dominance and women are the weaker sex is not the fact but an established concept &amp; its upto both the sexes that how they treat each other. If women choose to remain weak physically and men choose to remain strong then my dear confessor its of no use shouting for feminism or unisexism. Mere UNESCO working for women rights won't help, we must know how to see the grassroot of the problem.
We must know that that the equality of the genders have multiple nuances and strength is a major parameter, but simultaneously we must teach our generation how to treat people who are weaker than us. That is where the difference shall begin.</p>
