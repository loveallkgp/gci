<p>Sir. .I wanna know my orientation. ..</p>
<p>I'm 22 yrs and doing my PG. . I don't know nothing about gay life. ...One year back one guy proposed me. ..I didn't take that seriously. ..after thn while chatting he attracted me. .i love his care. .love. ..I'm really happy with him. ..thn decided to live with him... i have intrest on girls ( sex ) but I'm sure that I don't wanna marry them. ..I need my men only. .but I'm happy with him (including sex).. but he is worrying that he can't give the full sex (just like girl).. I said I don't need that. .I'm happy with you...While we are sexing. .I don't have interest to fuck him (ass)..hope its medically not good also. ..I will just mastrubate in his chest. .. I don't have intrest on any boys (only with him )...I need his love. .sometimes while mastrubating thinking about sex with girls. .so that my Cum comes out..I can't fuck him in tights as he is too tall. .. I'm happy with #Him ... I'm sure I need hin only. .I don't want anyone else. .. v should live together and help others too. .. but his friends (gay) are thinking that I will leave him one day and ran away. .but I'm sure. .I won't. . If I have a life. .its only with him. .I need a healthy and happy life. ..I'm totally confused. .Please guide me. .Help me. ..</p>
<p>I wanna know I'm a straight. .or..bi. .or gay ?
Whatever. .I'm proud on that. .and never leave him. ..</p>
<p>You may have doubt. .y I don't like girls. ...I had love failure. .so when I got the care and love from him. .I decided. .he should be mine and I should be to him</p>
<h1>GCI : see you shall not be worried about your sexuality here as you said that you had a love failure with a girl so maybe temporarily you are emotionally unstable after this incident . and when this guy came to you with his proposal you might have attracted coz of emotional support he is giving you .</h1>
<p>your relation with him isn't sexual or physical but rather emotional. its temporary and might go with time and after some time you might come out of shock and start having relations with girls again . so tell him about everything and stay with him but don't promise him marriage or relation . you guys can stay more of emotional pals .</p>
<p>sexuality is complex thing . one can't just say i am gay , bi or str8 at once . things are very complex . you give yourself time .</p>
