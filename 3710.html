<p>Hi guys, my name is Jack... I live in Nagaland. I am 21 years old. Well, I am a daddy bear chaser.. I don't know why But I am not sexually attracted to younger guys or those guys with slim body. I am sexually attracted only to Chubby uncle... I don't know whether  there is anyone like me or not who are sexually attracted only to chubby uncle, I guess there are some... Anyways, its been 21 years since I didn't had any lover, Feeling so desperate and lonely, no, I am not ugly, People say I am handsome and I know that I am manly as well. The fact is that all older guys are either married or straight, and I can't go for married guys even if they enjoy having fun with guys. No, I am not those who shouts their gayness to the world but the fact of the matter is that Deep down inside I wanna be loved and love.. I want to know how it feels to be in love. It has been 21 years without a single lover, yes, 21 years... I have tried every possible way to find a lover but all was invain.  I just hope one day I find my true happiness.</p>
