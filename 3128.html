<p>I m 24.
I m still virgin (ashame of this).</p>
<p>I think I am a curious bisexual who is a more inclined towards boys than girls.
I mostly watch girls in public, but I mostly watch only their beautiful faces while my frens watch everything else as well.
I do sometimes watch boys if they are really cute (again only face).</p>
<p>I mostly fantasize about me being a hot boy doing naughty things (with both boys and gals). While watching, seeing a man doing erotic and nasty things arouse me. I don't get aroused by just seing a penis, but a penis on a hot hunk, or a hot hunk with a little revealing clothes arouse me. I never fantasize about sucking a cock, but I do want to lick a pussy. I want to play with a man's body, women's boobs.
I fantasize about kissing both sexes.
The idea of Penetration sex with a man never arouse me. Though I would like to drill a girl. But again, most of my fantasize while jerking off (like 80%) involves me doing body play and kissing men.</p>
<p>I have been seduced by one of my friend (male) and kissed thrice, I liked it. Now I badly want to try kissing a girl.</p>
<p>I am confused about my sexuality. I neither like both sexes properly not dislike both.</p>
<h1>GCI- You sir, are a bisexual with less inclination towards sex.</h1>
