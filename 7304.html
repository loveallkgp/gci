<p>Hi, I never confessed here anything before. This is my first time but with a serious issue.</p>
<p>I don't know If I'm gay or not, neither it is my issue. Coming to the main point, I'm suffering from depression from last few months. I have lost my friends, family everything. After My graduation , I don't take anything (money) from my parent, neither they ask me if I need any. I was working here and there but all were temporary. Its been two years now I couldn't settle anywhere. Now situation is like that, I cant even take a breath properly in my home. No one talks with me. Often They scold me, quarrel over a silly thing. I have lost my Mother in my early age. I have second mom. But She never cares for me , neither my dad does. I always remain alone. Now recently aunt told me to leave home. Still I'm here because I dont have anyone with whom I can live. I'm dying every minute, every second. If I dont get a job , I will die.</p>
<p>I confessed here with a little hope of living my life. If I could settle outside I will leave home for good. I have Passport also. I can go anywhere, only I need some Help, or reference. </p>
<p>Pls I request you to send message me from your real account only. That is my real account. Thank to everyone.</p>
