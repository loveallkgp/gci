<p>Me n my bf were reallly happy together but now he broke up with me.We were in rlnship since past 1 year n i use to told him join gym though he was perfect BMI wise but i love guys with biceps and triceps :( whenever we use to go out for dinner and movies i use to compare him with any gym toned guy come across. Ab apni opinion rakhna galat hai kya? i use to insist him to join gym. We were so happy together he use to take me to classy restaurants for dinner , late night drives and oll. But last week when i compare him wd a toned guy he got very angry n just dropped me my hostel saying that its our last meeting n we r not meeting again ever in life, he seems hurt while saying so.Then he texted me saying we should move on bcz m not ur type and i cant promise to be toned bcz i hv 12 hours ofc. n i love u but i m not worthy of u.Its one year n u regularlly says this. wish u gt one soon u r hot :( yr i do gymming so asking fr a toned bf is not wrong :/ m missing him.he has blocked my no. n on wtsapp facebook too. I wanna die.I cant live wdout him..plz suggest me guys m begging from u all :( .plz admin i just want him back.. his sense of humour was so awesome n i hvnt smile single time in this week.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmmm......First of all SLAP on both sides of your face.</h1>
<p>Now lemme put this really straight.
U need a Bodyguard and not a bf. U need a sex toy and not a lover. U need a partner to show off to others, not to LOVE u.</p>
<p>If these words hurt you then think of the amount u hurt him by comparing him all the time for being gym toned???
Dude I really doubt that whether u really deserve him bcoz by ur confession all i can gather is that u r still a teenager at the back of ur ass and he is A MAN. 
If u really want him back love him the way he is and one day he will definitely try to be like the way u want ur partner to be.</p>
<p>P.S- Yahan log sacche pyar k liye marey jaa rahe ahin aur iss lodu ko gym toned body ki padi hai!</p>
