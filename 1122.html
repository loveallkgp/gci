<p>A cat came to my kitchen everyday and mess my kitchen manytimes, Everyday i cook non veg, and if i forget to kept in the fridge , This cat will come and spoil it, sometimes if he didnt find anything then this cat will pull down my dustbin and tried to get something fom there. Yesterday also they finish my chicken. This cat knows how to open the lid also. just now i was in the room and i hear some noise in the kitchen, i went inside and i found 2 cats in the kitchen.1 escaped through the window but i got one, i hit him with broom manytimes and then open the window again so that he can escape. This cat was so scared , so he tried to escaped from the small opening and got wedge between 2 iron bar. i hit him again on the ass many times with broom, Finally he went off , wish they never come back again.</p>
