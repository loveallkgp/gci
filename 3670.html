<p>I'm 21 now. When I was about 10 yrs old, I had a friend who stayed in the same apartments as me. He was 8. We used to play together. Once while playing wrestling on his bed, we got close and started trying to strip each other. This was long before I'd even heard the word- gay. 
Ever after that he used to insist on playing wrestling especially if  no one was at home. We used to play and slap each others butts. I used to enjoy it a lot. Unfortunately he shifted out a few years later and I used to miss him. Eventually I forgot him. Now I feel bad when I think about those incidents, I should not have encouraged him.</p>
<h1>GCI- You like spanking, eh? Naughty boy. ;)</h1>
