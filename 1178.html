<p>Helo!! I am just 18 yr old boy.m a teenager.what i am going to confess today may b qute cheesy for others.but the thing is that i am in love  wid a married guy who has 1 year old kid too.idk why i like only mature guys. I knew hm snce three years bt neva had such feelngs for him.recently i had met hm and my feelngs for him started to grow.His name is enuf for m to get goosebumps.i feel like wish i cud convert him to b like me..My things are pondering in my head. Wish i knw some black magic.i neva had felt like ths before.i am surprisd wit myself.i cant thnk of anythng.Al i want is he he he .... What is more painful is he is a simple haply setled man wit his family. Wish i had enuf courage to aproach him..its very hurtful for m to accept it ..my soul 's is trapd .my mind consits of his image and my heart beats only for him .gve me suggestions people. What to do. Answer genuinely !! Plz</p>
<h1>Viv- It all comes down to whether or not you had the courage to take a stand for yourself when the time was right and when gay people get married, they still meet guys. Some poor guys like you then go through emotional torment. The feelings can emerge out of anywhere and I don't blame you. But you are just 18. Think about your future with him. You will just be a second option for him as his first priority will always be his wife and kid. You need someone who could stay with you and love you only. You can be his friend but search love somewhere else.</h1>
