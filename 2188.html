<p>straight people dont know much about gayism n all that n coz of lack of knowledge they think gays are like crossdressers..etc
and they have seen crossdresser's worst behaviour at public places so they set their hatred mentality for all gays..n it is a big reason our family are not accepting us as gay..
ques arises why do crossdressers do such awkward activities in public n destroy the image of all of us..in the eyes of common people..why not they behave in a proper way..???</p>
<h1>GCI : you know when we sa 'gay' our parents and our friends hhave this image of gays ' where two men act girlish , dress in women clothes and wear a drag make up ' . its not their fault ... its fault of media showing us like that .</h1>
<p>yes they don't know what gay is ... they relate gay with 'gender' . 
they imagine 'haw two men have sex' but they don't imagine that ' gay can be two normal men they see in normal routine' . </p>
<p>and for god sake ' parents' once you accept us that doesn't mean we will start  going in  public places .. dressed in women clothes and acting sissy . </p>
<p>please educate your people on gay culture . crossdressers , trangenders , eunuch's , drags ... there is lot more difference in them . but again i am not shaming here anyone ....but everyone when u get your identity questioned is a very suppression and irritating moment .</p>
