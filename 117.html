<p>Hi admin I am from a small town of sunder nagar in himachal. Three months earlier I met a guy in my town and we go in relation but since last month I found he has no time for me and is ignoring me I do not know whether is he busy or have someone else in his life or just ignoring me. He using his another gay fake id making new friends chat pics all . So last week I decided he needs a break so I met him and clear out "I found you have changed or ignoring me so i m giving you a break for some weeks or a month . I am not breaking up but giving you a time to explore the world find new friends" I just want him to do all which he is doing now . I do not want to force him to continue with me because I really love that guy . Please tell me my decision of giving him a break is good or what should I do because he is not telling the reason why he now has no time left for me</p>
<h1>AdminViv- Yeah you should give it a break. One day you will be glad to do so. So hold your heads and tits up and walk your life like you own that shit.</h1>
