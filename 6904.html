FYI they didn't really force .. But stared acting a lot weird idk acly I got ready as soon as they were asked me to ..I thought I can go what's the big deal anyway ..I can do this for then ..so within the next week I was sitting with my sycatrist .. He was a cool guy ..he undestood me ..n then he send me out n the session of my parents start ..it was so dam weird for me ..my parents insisted me to go to an another one n called him a dork ..I told then I am fine now n I am not gay ..I was just kidding ...after that its so weird to live in my house ..just want to ran away n who knows I will ...acly I have also applied for helix studios California and as soon the letter comes from there I am going away ... And the provide money for travel too .. So just pray guys ...

What should I do ..</p>
<h1>GCI- Get your head out of it. I was a virgin until 2 years ago and I am still in closet. There is a time for everything, and first thing that matters is your safety, both physical, emotional and financial. Double think every step that you take.</h1>
<p>PS- Use condoms every time.</p>
