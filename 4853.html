<p>Myself ranjan from kolhapur. Few day ago ,one boy from our colony died. He was sucided. Mujhe proper pata nahi par wo confirm gay tha. I was scared after that incident.
I am alwase think that ...why I m born as gay. Maine aise koun si galti ki hai aisa kounsa paap kiya hai ki mera janm aise hua. Koi mujhko samajh nahi paata . Dosto me bhi mai straight hone ki acting karta hu. Duniya KO hamaari itni gheen kyu aati hai?? As a gay OK......par India me hi kyu?????
Agar mai physically handicapped hota to kisi ko to meri dayaa aaati.mujhe koi to life partner milta. Lekin as a gay ek bhi banda trust ke kabil nahi ....sab sexseeker. Aap me se kitne longo ke Facebook Id true hai?????anyone.
I m confused ki kiski tarah act karu ladki ya ladka. If god ask me ....agale janam me kya banoge. I alwase tell....kuchh bhi chalega without homosexual.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay for once stop think what people think about you. For the society if anything is not majority, it's abnormal. Why do you have to base your opinion on them? I feel sad for the people who commit suicide just because they are different. It is not good at all. It really does breaks my heart to hear news like this.</h1>
<p>You are not alone in this. There are many others who think the same way. To all of you who think the same, DO NOT THINK ABOUT KILLING YOURSELF. Your life is precious and someone is indeed fighting for you. If you have any trouble, there are some people who will listen to you. Do not shed your tears just because you do not fit in the society. You are precious and you are meant to live your life the way you want.</p>
