<p>i believe i always loved him ever since he started showing his love towards me. he was the most persistent guy i've ever known, the guy who loved me like nobody ever did, the guy who'd never get mad at me and was always patient with me. 
he wanted to be alone with me, with no one else to interrupt. but i was not ready for that, i believe that when i still had my youth and guys crazy to get on bed with me i should use it to the fullest and fuck em all. initially he was willing to keep his ideas of a relationship aside and adjust with my policy of keeping sexual and romantic relationships separate. so we started off an open relationship with the condition that we both tell each other about whom we fuck.
but he rarely hooked up, i was the slut, running around banging guys. soon, he could not bear to hear about my hook ups and hence i was told be silent about my hook ups and i agreed to that too. but that turned out even worse and finally he asked me for a closed relationship, and because i was sure that unless we live together, i was not ready for a closed relationship, so i refused and he asked for a break up and i did not hold him back. and we agreed to be friends and we have are still friends.
how much ever i move on, i still love him a lot and i know that he still loves me a lot more than i love him. but i dont think we can be together cos what we both want in life is different and we will not be happy together.
and baby, if u r reading this; letting u go would be hard, but please move on. i cant be at any ease unless i know that u r at some place better off than when u were when we were together. there are many guys, a lot better than me and who deserve u, please go on with them and be happy.</p>
<h1>AdminViv- i guess its better for the both of you. The compatibilty in ur case is out of the question.</h1>
