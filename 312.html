<p>$$ abby : uhmm okay .... first of all homosexuality is nothing to be ashamed of ...  secondly figure it out what you want , you want to party then party , you want to stay away from people who take advantage then maintain a distance , you are homosexual ... be proud of it  . nothing to be confused .. as simple as that .</p>
