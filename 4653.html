<p>Hey All,</p>
<p>I'm Daniel from post 4136 ! After reading a few posts about sexual abuses I felt like sharing my experience and maybe I could get a better understanding of such situations and its effect on one's intimacy.</p>
<p>Well, it's the first time I'm saying it out loud (nobody know abt it). I precisely remember the night while I was traveling from Pune to my hometown, I was 13. I was visiting my place for Diwali and I was traveling all by myself in the crowded luxurious bus. People kept boarding in and out of the bus since it was the busy season. After a pit stop a rugged bearded guy came and sat next to me. To avoid any small talks, I pretended to be asleep. After the bus started moving again, I felt few fingers coming in through my T-shirt near waist. I thought the guy must have misplaced his hands or something like that, so I shook it off. But after a while, his hands again started lingering around my waist. I was frozen. I didnt know what to do. After that I felt his fingers going down my waist region. My heart was pounding like crazy and all kinda horrible stuff started coming to mind about getting kidnapped or raped. I didn't wanted to create a scene in the bus, so I shrugged off and pretended to be sleeping again. This went on for 4 hours. I felt like death would be less scarier than what had happened.</p>
<p>It has been like 10 years now, but that it feels like it happened yesterday. This experience leads to me believe the reasons behind me being who I am and what have I become. Even amongst friends I'm not that comfortable to touch or being touched by someone. Being intimate is a far fetching dream for me (not very realistic). I feel confused by getting defined by such an experience. Any thoughts?
Let me know.</p>
<p>Guy with a big V on the forehead,</p>
<h1>GCI- For a 13 year old indeed that is a big thing to go through. Whenever a thing like this happens, always create a scene. There will be people who will come to your aid. If you show your weak side, people like the one you encountered will have guts to take your advantage.</h1>
