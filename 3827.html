<p>Hello admin.
I am Arijit Biswas, again I am here but this time with a question.
I wonder don't girlish bottoms like me dosen't deserve true love are we pimps? Everytime I chat with a guy , he asks for my nude pics because I have my shirtless pics or I have pics of mine wearing hot pants in my profile.
He will call me in the midnight and ask for phone sex because my no. is publicly visible.
I know everybody will say I shouldn't post such pics and should not set my no. visible to public but dosen't these jerks have hearts?
Ya I love to look hot and sexy, it dosent mean I am easily available for sex.
I love to talk to people, make new friends and my no. is visible to you , it dosen't mean I am inviting you for phone sex.
I am looking for a boyfriend and I am bit desperate because I am very lonely, it dosen't mean I am asking you to use me then break my heart.
I don't know that why people think that I have an attitude like Jenifer Lopez if I say looks matter to me.
You know I am really very depressed and hopeless. I am tired of waiting for so called true love. I tried to kill myself many times but failed, I know I sound childlike but I can't help myself. I really need someone else, a loving and careing bf but I know I am not so lucky. No guy will marry me . Most of the guys want sex either timepass or a false feeling of love.
Sorry I wanted to say something and ended up saying something else.
Please help!</p>
<h1>GCI- Its just like with girls, like when they go out in sexy clothes and with some make up on, people think like they are inviting others for sex. Same is the case here. In this facebook gay world if you have naked pics or sexy expressions, you will be asked about sex. Don't feel bad about it.</h1>
<p>And see, everybody is lonely. But people like to live shallow life and its everywhere. It's an easy escape from the feelings and responsibilities. The more you wait, more sad you will get. So just wait and your guy will automatically come to you.</p>
