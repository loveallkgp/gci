thnx to all guy for your answers, it's help me alot...
now i want to ask if two guys are in relationship, and one of them is working n other one is student... then is it necessary for the working guy that he is always busy in work and he doesn't found 5mins in 24hrs for the partner?
But he always says he loves him...
so, is it love or lust.???</p>
<p>$ABBY : do you think he will call and you will juat talk 5 mins LOL .... you will keep on talking for m30 minutes..telling him your stories. see a working man is tired man... for all day long that man at work is dealing with bullshit and is really tired , he probably can't listen to what you did in school . so just let him rest .
and if you really like him .. can't you yourself visit him after eve when he is free..instead of a call i think when yopu meeet face to face... it makes bond more strong .  and there are weekends...  you can talk to him on weekends ... just because he is in relation don't put rules on him.. don't bound him. 
OMG .. these guys are always insecure.. if you think he is only because of lust then test him. don't have sex. ( bitches be always blaming he wants sex ... and inside thay be wanting sex too ) ..</p>
