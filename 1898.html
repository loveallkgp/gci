<p>hyyy... I needed help in in identifying my cousin bcz wen I was small he actually tuk me t a rokm nd closed my eyes and he started playin wit ny dick.. pushing up and down.. and he asked me how I felt. .. but now am grown enough and I want to knw if hes still interested in me or no... how do I do tat??</p>
<h1>GCI : see its hard to say that only gay men do sex. mostly as kids we do sexual things as part of curiosity and fun . he might have done that because of curiosity . he is grown up now and understands what is wrong and what is right .</h1>
<p>still if you wanna know go to him when his is alone .. try talking to him and the all of sudden come to topic '' ask him if he remembers that thing he did to you in childhood'' .... if he is straight he will either deny or maybe laugh at it saying he was just a kid . if he is curious then he might touch again</p>
