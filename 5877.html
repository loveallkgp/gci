<p>Warning : WEAK PEOPLE DON'T READ THIS.</p>
<p>I don't knw I'm gay or Bisexual or Straight. And, How can I be Gay?? as I have fucked girl with my full of engergy n Yeah I liked that but I like to fuck a boy/man too. So, means I'm gay?? No I'm nt gay because I don't wanna fall-in-luv with boys/men. I don't have (love) feelings for them. If there's any its only for temporary. Yes I just need a hole, whether its a boy, girl or watever.. Why gay people can't understand this even I tell them? If I had sex with any gay, they usually fell in luv with me. Oh! Come on.. Having a single night stay can't make u fall in luv. Thats d thing I hate mostly. Atleast take ur time, and get to knw me, what type of person I'm or What my Preferences are! First time, u agree for sex and second time u demand for love. Is Love is a Joke for u?? Btw... Same people who have appreciated and Praised me yesterday, will bark now like dog, for saying the truth. .</p>
<p>PS: NO OFFENCE TO ANYONE. ITS JUST A MESSAGE FROM ME THAT LOVE AND SEX ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. DON'T MIX-UP IT.</p>
