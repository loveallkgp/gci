<p>Bilawal, 20 Pakistan.
I am pursuing MBBS in Russia. I saw some good comments here &amp; started chatting with them in inbox. There is a boy(gay) Tushar. I asked him a question,
what if I say that I am pakistani and I love you ? , he answered that he will simply block me :(
how rude it is....... I liked your nature but, why you hate pakistanis ?
then, he starts making fun of me as my name is same as Bilawal Bhutto :(
After that, I requested him to hv cam chat, after 2 days he agreed.
on cam, he was looking nice :) but when I asked can you remove your shirt (It was a joke), he start abbusing. Again i apologize.
Then, Me-"Are you open to his family?"
He- "no I am not open to my family".
Me- "then, what about your future?"
He-"I'll tell them and will have a gay marrige too"
Me-"Are you sure ? Your indian parents will understand?"
He- "Yes, because they are mine and they are not pakistani"
and now this attitude boy Tushar answer me,
"If your sure that your parents will understand then why u taking time?"
waitin</p>
<h1>GCI- Well you know, some people love stupid categorizations. They cannot think beyond the boundaries. You and anyone who faces discrimination are far better off of such bigots. Its sad that even gay people who have been through so much crap in their lives also think like this.</h1>
<p>PS- If I see hate comments here, I will not think twice before blocking that person. #SpreadLove_NotHate</p>
