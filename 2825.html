<h1>GCI- People think that after a break if they go for random hook ups or what we call as rebound sex, they can ease the pain. It never happens. After a break up everyone deserves a break in which you concentrate on yourself and your own life. A bit of living for yourself doesn't harm you. Afterall, if you are contended, only then can you be happy in your next relation and your private life. So concentrate on the stuff that you like. Staying in the dark never really has a benefit on you, has it?</h1>
