<p>I became friends with one of of a guy ( I sent him friend request Via my fake profile). HE was so damn pretty that I just kept seeing the same pics over and over again.We became friends... and the very same day he posted a groin covered nude pic to me saying he is gay too , I did however wished that he was gay initially, I just felt like I was very lucky.He found my pics cute and blah blah. Well we chatted... became friends and I started to expect too much may be.Whenever he wouldn't chat first I would get heart broken.i did have a vibe that it was lust In the beginning. Well I still convince my self that it's lust . He was so sweet to me, later I found out he was doing the same with everybody. It did hurt me a bit but his attention was filling the gap. He would always send me a pic volunteerily VIA WHATSAPP.... well I knew he wasn't going to be the "love material guy" ..but yeah I fell for him. Out of frustration that he was sleeping round with guys, well , don't blame him, I deleted his number.He asked me why is my dp not visible. I told him Coz I deleted his number.well without asking for reasons he simply said "alright it's over don't talk abt me to someone else, I won't too". That was it...He blocked me in fb (thank god he didn't in my fake profile though we are not friends there, probably he just doesn't care) and that as it...OVER :(
I did owe him him a kiss.... And he would ask for it everyday....
Its been year now... I miss you, in the beginning I thought I lusted your extreme good looks. .. but now even after a year, your pretty face still melts me, I stalk you everyday and see your pics thinking how we could have met living in the same city. Sadly u graduated and left town this June. I still miss you and your cute face and your pics and I miss the kiss I owe you...I think this is love though one way...I am still happy for the good times we spent over virtually. I love you and j think will always will..... </p>
<h1>GCI- Eww. Never love a person who sends you his nudes and says, "I am gay." I think you can be better than that and I am sure that you can do better than that.</h1>
