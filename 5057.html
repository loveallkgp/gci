<p>Hey guys.
I just read few posts here and felt that I should also share my feelings. I appreciate the admin for his efforts. You are doing a great job.
I'm a bi. Recently I had hots for a guy in my class. But we never interacted in class.By his actions and behavior I never thought he could be a gay. One day he messaged me and confessed that he likes me. It was a dream come true moment for me. The next obvious step was to get into relationship. But that didn't happen.</p>
<p>He lured me with all sorts of appreciation all the time but never committed to get into the relationship because of few exams that he had to give. He promised me to wait untill then. And now that the exams are over he has refused. I'm totally shattered. He used to call me everyday but now he doesn't even care to drop a text also. I'm not able to concentrate on my studies and other stuff. Your kind suggestions will be valuable. Please help me out. Thanks</p>
<h1>GCI- It happens honey, but don't feel bad about it. Don't be affected by this radio silence all of a sudden. People can be great lovers one night and strangers the next day. He was never yours.</h1>
