<p>I want to share some of my thoughts.. I like boys and easily fall in love with boys if I wish...again I love my friends which are girl but this love is purely affectionate ,no sexual desire towards girls...I like watching handsome boys...not everyboys... I had had sex with boys when I was in high school..
but I remembered that My first cum came out after inserting my thing into va*** of a girl..and I did 3 to 4 times with her after that... All this things were happening when I was in class 8. I stopped sex with her after she asked me eat her breast...because I don't had any interest to that things... But I had enjoyed sex with her .... After that I have never done sex with any girl .
Now I think if I can enjoy sex with a girl that may create love wala feelings towards them..
because I never feel love feelings for any girl...I don't know who is sexy or not...only if I become close to any girl and she likes me then I like her...this is affection wala love..here my heart doesn't beat for this love ...so what u all suggest me
..should I try a girl? This may change my life

<h1>Viv- Kya baat hai, 8th class se experienced ho? And they say sex is taboo. OH! The irony! Anyways, things that you wrote clearly depict that you are romantically involved with guys. So, according to me you are gay(YAY!) Feelings for girls are/were just sexual. But if you want to be sure for yourself, you can try out with a girl.</h1>
