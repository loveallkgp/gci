<p>i ve been chatting with this guy in fb.. we both r still in closet.. and i like him much more.. we dont chat unless i started it.. its been abt a week that he doesnt reply my sms.. admin wat do u think is he playng with me?</p>
<h1>GCI- Even if you text someone, don't do it with the expectations of getting in a relation or landing in someone's bed.. even if you are chatting from 2-3 days. That should keep the things like "why is he not texting me?", "Does he like me?", "He shouldn't play with me." etc etc etc away from you. But as you have already developed a bit of likeliness, you should either drop hints to him as to get some response, or you should just tone down your feelings if he is not responding. You can do either of those depending upon his behavior.</h1>
