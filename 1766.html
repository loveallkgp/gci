<p>hey admin and ol
m living in boys hostel and hav a crush over a guy senoir to me.
he started talking to me and asked fr sex but i want lov nt sex
so unexpectedly he revealed ol d story to his frends due to which i had to bear dirty comments of his frendz for 2 years.
now he is going as he has completed his studies , only one week is left
BUT I LOV DAT PRSN STILL
i ignor him in front of him
dnt evn look at him , but i secretly stare him n he also do same
he has done wrong to me but he still has my heart.
i want to approach him again but afraid of past story
but he is about to go
dnt knw wat to do?</p>
<h1>Viv- Well, honestly if someone had done this to me, I'd definitely had not talked with him at all. The question is, how can you be in love with a person if he spoiled your image and let you deal with the torment for 2 years just because you denied him the sex? He and his gang of skanks must be having a gang bang every other night. He's going and you have to let him go. There are good people in the world too. Humans do have the knack of choosing those things which are worst for them, whether its love or anything else.</h1>
