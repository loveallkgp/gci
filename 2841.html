<p>One person said smthing about proud to be gay slogan thing. I partially agree. How can anyone be proud to be gay. You are just gay I mean you dont see people moving around shouting I am proud to be boy, or i m proud to be straight. You have not accomplished anything. You are just that. Do something meaningful for others  to be proud.Something good. until then keep all your fake pride in your pants</p>
<h1>gci :  i have my view on it. do you ever see a man go out and say i am proud to be man ..no . is there any man pride day . no . but there is women's pride day . women from past century have started going out and started saying ' proud to be women ' . why , because  women were considered unequal , smaller from men , weak . they say 'proud to be women ' not coz its achievement just to tell the people who discriminate on them for being a women to tell them ' i am proud' . in a discrimination full world when you are being proud of being yourself ( yes , to me its an achievement )</h1>
<p>have you ever seen a white person going out and saying '' proud to be white' .  or have you ever heard 'white day '
but there is 'black day ' . they endured slavery for many centuries , they were killed , they were treated bad  ], they were discriminated .
and today if they say ' proud to be black '  yes ( to me its an achievement )   </p>
<p>same way were hetero-sexuals ever been condemened or killed for loving somebody or for being who they are . did they ever felt ignorance , mockery , punishments , being left out , unsafe in family , insecure in a world full of laws of security .... no . in a world full of heteros when you get ' gay rights' and in happiness you say ' proud to be gay' .. yes .. yes .. and yes .... ( its an achievement )</p>
<p>achievement against discrimination on people 
achievement of humanity over in-human
achievement of love over the hatred 
achievement of equality  over the people who think they deserve more rights coz they are in big number .</p>
