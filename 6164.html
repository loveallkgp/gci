<p>Hello all
I am 23 , student pursuing masters when i was in 7th standard there was a guy next door who used to seduce me make me touch his willy and all tried inserting it once bt failed as i was in pain i did nt knew much of this at that time am a reserved type of guy bt tht touch felt good ,,,
later when i went to 10th i started understanding things so distant myself from him as i came to know its bad was not that fa-miler with word gay but still knew something is strange for me..</p>
<p>Went to college, left my home started staying in hostel.. being shy reserved guy it was difficult for me to adjust share nd all i was even afraid of sleeping alone there came a guy in my life he cared for me bt he was straight ,,, i knew i have different feeling for him but never expressed time passed on i did so many things for him to make him understand it is more than frdship but never confronted him .... we graduated not in contact any more with him</p>
<p>But problem is that all this left me with very low self esteem because of that i hv always been an underachiever though m in one of india s best college and doing quite good bt still smwhr i feel no matter what i do i won t able to get my identity, i fear that so many people will leave me if i confront .... there is no body i can share all this never been in a relationship as most of them in gay world are passing by ... now feeling like taking my chances... all these insecurities killed my happiness till now but no more on the other hand finding it hard to trust here... or trust myself i should say .. do i need to hav sm casual dates ...is it normal because chances sm of them may end at sex,, suggestions are appreciated i will continue this confession .. </p>
<h1>GCI- Casual dates and sex will help you little. You have to find your lost confidence. You need some good friends from the community who are understanding and compassionate. There are people in the community as well, who will judge you for being you. You need some good people to talk to.</h1>
<p>In the end, love yourself because if you can't love yourself, how the hell you are gonna love somebody else. Can I get an Amen in here?</p>
