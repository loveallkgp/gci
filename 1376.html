<h1>Viv- Hmm my friend once told me that "Forbidden fruit is always sweeter." In this case your friend is the forbidden fruit because he is with someone else. Now, your psychology is working in a particular way. You two had an amazing chemistry but now he is sharing his time with someone else. You can say that a bit of jealousy factor is interfering and also there is a longing to be with him is increasing. There can be a mutual liking between the two of you but certain thing is holding you back. Jo ho raha hai, jaisa ho raha hai, hone do.. Do nothing for now. The things will themselves fall into the right place.</h1>
