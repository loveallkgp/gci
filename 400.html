<p>Hi I am a gay guy from punjab. I love one of my Vry Gud frnds. bt it seems to b completely one sided. I have expressed my love to him many times but he nvr reacts or changes the topic. he don't like me to touch his body. I want to move away but I can't even think of anyone else. I care for his every little thing but he claims it to b irritating or chipkau at times. I need some suggestion on moving on without hurting.</p>
<h1>Viv- Moving on is never easy. Been there done that. It will take too much amount of guts to finally move on. You have to block all contacts and not to think about him. If he was your good friend, he wouldn't have said words like irritating and chipku to you. Instead he would have confronted you. Anyway, its his loss. Not yours.</h1>
