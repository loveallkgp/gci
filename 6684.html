<p>Hi, 
I am 23 gay, I have found a new way to handle my depression, I would suggest you should try it out as well. Whenever I feel that I am leading a worthless and lonely life and feel like giving up, I go for shopping in the nearby Street Market. There I can see an 80 year old woman selling a few bunches of coriander and curry leaves, sitting from morning until dusk to do so, in hope to feed herself properly. I can see a paralyzed cobbler in his forties, stitching and polishing the shoes of the passing by pedestrians. I can see a very thin old man in his eighties pulling a wheeled cart to sell some vegetables, and many others like these. I just go to these people and buy things that I need and let them keep the change, in return I see a gratifying smile. It makes me wonder that even after going through so much in their lives, they have the strength to smile and be happy and the courage to fight with the circumstances. It makes me feel ashamed of myself as how can I feel pity about myself, just because I don't have any friends or family. I have a house to live in, food to eat and clothes to wear. Remember if you are having a mobile in your hands and are able to read my confession then you are in a better condition than than 80 percent of the people in India.</p>
