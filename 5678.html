<p>Today was my college (Hansraj college ) fest and i attended and enjoyed the western dance competition there.... But one thing made me sad there and that was in most of the teams performing their (basically from co- ed colleges ) have shown a guy dancing like a girl.... Or two guys have smooched each other while performing ( and background music was " aaj phir tum pe pyar aaya hai " ) ....it made me sad that why do they make fun of homosexuality? ...though it was fun for them but i really didn't like that !!!! I felt lil bad there.... That's why shared this to you !!! But i liked that guy who was dancing in girlish manner !!!! </p>
<h1>GCI-  Ok bitch!!! Smooched???? r u sure they smooched???</h1>
