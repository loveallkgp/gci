<p>Hi folks,
This is my first post on this page. I have read a lot of constructive comments and advice. I hope you guys could do the same for me.
I was in on and off LDR relationship with a guy for about 4 years. We met just once. And tbh I never felt that I was in love with him. I might have rushed the things. Because I was in terrible position when I met him and online media was my only friend at the moment. He was very and honest but I never had the guts to tell him the truth.
I met another guy online and even he is far away. When this new guy asked me to be in relationship with him, I simply said no. But he just wanted me to re-think.
Both these guys are wonderful. One is passionate, honest and practical.  Other is friendly, adjustable, elite and realistic. I was thinking maybe I am the only one stopping myself to fall in love because of the previous relationship I had. And if that's the case then I don't know how to deal with it. How to break that wall around my heart? And if it's not me then what else is there that keeps me from loving someone. I can't force myself to love someone. It's not under my will. 
Please help me. I don't know how to cope up with it. 
I might have sounded bit childish but please overlook that help with honest constructive advice.
Thanks!</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm....Considering ur situation i would suugest few things to be seen...</h1>
<p>1- Its ok to feel for someone without having the tag of love.
2- But its not ok to say that u love that person when u dont know about the depth of ur feelings for that person.
3- Its fine that u made a wall to be safe but its not fine to not let ur trait of trusting someone not to be used as it should be.
4- U must understand that it takes courage to be with someone wholeheartedly and that it must be mustered by strong will and a healed and pure heart..
5- Love happens automatically ..its not a switch off switch on mode...its an auto- pilot mode where ur mind understands the chemical locha and asks u to act accordingly.
6- One last thing i would bring into light is that ur capacity to be happy alone and making a autosexual bond with urself will allow u to understand that love is not a decision...its a feeling!
GOODLUCK DEAR!</p>
<p>P.S- LDR or not...love is love...it cannot be understood by words..it is seen in actions.</p>
