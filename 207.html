<p>i am top though i havnt fck anyone till date coz of immaturity of my dck means it pains when i start to FCK nyone ... but yeah hav dn sx 3times with my cousin but only body play...</p>
<p>but unfortunately i found one guy on fb .. he is top too but dont know why from my fucking bad luck i think i hav started to like him ... we chat daily n whatsaap but he replies lil later after my text or reply.. and i told him that its very difficult to wait  for his reply then he says he cant chat with me all the time bcoz he doesnt want to fall in love again.. he said if he keeps on chating all the time then he will start to like me which is not good for his health.. so i too stop chating with him coz for me also love is not good for health... it makes me blind , makes me thinking of him only all the time... </p>
<p>so we both decided to chat a day in a week only... but i think we became victim of love already ... mene isse pehle bisexual love ko hamesha reject karte araha tha, i hav got more thn 10 proposals from boys and i stop contacting all of them thinking bisexual love is a just word not true thing.. but now i think i am one of the guy from those who had approached to me... life seriously sucks with the thing "love"</p>
<p>$$$ADMIN_ABBY : sweet mother of gay god .........!!!! -_- go finish 
your school first ... darling .. love shove baad cho ker lai . i mean when i was 17 i too fell in love with a guy who was str8 .... it was deeply madly love ... 4 yrs later i realized how kiddish it was .. its just feelings ... lol ..</p>
