<p>hei hi..
m sohal frm chd..
I wana ask is gayism just indicates the xxxxxxxxx... y people over here so .x. oriented ..
I desired to have some gd frnds over here or may be a special one..
bt failed to find anyone having the thought
" WHATS UR PREFERENCES,  UR LIKING,  U FRM?  , UR AGE N PLACE.."
is that all about gayism..</p>
<p>or some genuine fellings above this to be a frnd...</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>$ABBY : and i don't know what the fuss is all about friendzoning gay guys . being a gay guy which gay guy would actually want to be friend seriously . i want friend  i will go to straight girls , or  gay girls , or maybe straight boys  ... 
here is a thing ... you chat with person , you talk about things and if you find them intresting you meet them . if you like him and he likes you to .. you get into relationship and if you don't you tell them that and move on and don't put them in friendzone . 
i personally never get this thing called ' i am looking for friendship and then more' .. it means you are saying ' if you are not fuckable we will be friends and if you are fuckable we will fall into relationship ''.
and why do you add such people or even reply them . </p>
<p>believe me , more then 300 conffessions arelike yours ... and you are saying u can't find a person of same thought . so that means those conffessors are liars .</p>
