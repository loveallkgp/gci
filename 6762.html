<p>hi m 37 years old post-op heterosexual trans woman.i almost paid 8 lacks for my surguries. i feel so lonely these days. i feel incomplete for being unmarried till now. dated so many guys, but nobody wants to marry a trans woman,almost everyone wants discreet relations and those  who want to marry , they step back for their family... i have visited many lgbt social groups, m very open but haven't find any guy. i m not loosing my hope but how to overcome this lonelyness?</p>
<h1>GCI- Indian society is very much close minded. I have seen some examples over here in Canada as well where biological males and females get startled when some trans men or women date them. It is something really new to process and some people cannot even understand it properly the hardships that trans people go through in their lives. In situations like these, many trans people have found solace by socializing with other trans people, just because they can relate. I hope you find someone worthy for yourself.</h1>
