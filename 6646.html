<p>Hi everyone, I am 24 gay. My manager today called me on his desk and said that he is very impressed with my work and has high expectations from me. I was very happy till then, after that he asked me about my future plans, I turned totally blank, I changed the conversation to my professional plans. Actually I don't really have any personal plans, I always thought that I have a lot of time till to think about my life, but I apparently I don't, people have started asking what I want to do, where I want to live, when I plan to get married and I am totally blank. I have gone with the wind till now, I have started losing touch with my friends, my friends are either getting married or are committed. I don't know if I will die alone, will there be anyone there to comfort me when I am sick, will there be anyone to take care of me when I grow old. I have fought in the past, I am still fighting but the future sure scares me as hell.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hold it right there!</h1>
<p>I have some fucking goddamn questions to ask here.
1- What is personal life without a proper set goal of self-sufficiency or non understanding of the self in terms of intellect, emotions and spiritual quotient????
2- Why so much of nostalgia for friends and long gone life?! People change, relations change, social circles change and the fucking very understanding of us goes through an overhaul...why not develop new thought pattern??
3- Tell me you will be alive after 10 years with 101% guarantee and I will answer on ur future shit thing.. Deal!
4- Why there is no goal set for personal life in terms of living life the way we want?!</p>
<p>Alone! U tell me about being alone well then listen with all the orifices of yours, open them and hear and print it in your head that we share our loneliness when we are with someone. Be nice to yourself all the time and be your own friends first bcoz most of the time we have to live with ourselves, so try to understand that we are basically alone in this god damned world and all other shit is a decorated shit to make us believe that we are with somebody and that needs genuine emotions and a very broad understanding of the self, the world, the society in which we live and above all the life we want to live as it should be lived.
If you are not able to answer these then work on yourself more and stop being an askhole.</p>
