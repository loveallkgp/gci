<p>okay I'm writing this just to clear my head off all the emotions going on during exams.... I'm in my final year engg. and have been through a lot of bullying, name calling, inappropriate mentions &amp; tags with girls, and yeah blah blah of usual things homosexuals get from straight people... But I have always followed the good old way and just didn't care about them at all..never replied, retaliated or fought back! because I never felt it was necessary to start an argument or fight ..cause there was no point in doing so, as they wouldn't care for it and that their bullshit would only increase.. I don't have to prove myself to some jerks who think they are only normal people on earth and homosexuals are some weird creatures..people who can be picked upon, bullied, teased, doubted about our sexuality in public!! The worst part is when it happens in public or public platforms, which really humiliates us.. But, I have grown intolerance towards the issue lately, and have decided to voice my opinions and give it back on their face!! So I'm gonna keep posting little incidents that happened with me and how I was degraded in public, and pen all the notions that were happening in my head at that time! #keep_waiting_for_some_powerful_and_intense_dialogues_of_bullied_bisexual,#_cause_of_the_lack_of_masculinity_in_homophobic_world. PS : for whoever peeps into my profile and gets offended/judgmental about me!! 1. No, I'm not a sex freak homo! 2. I'm a very normal person with the very level desires and lust, just like you 3. If the world accepted us and treated us normal, we would have not brought a private act to a open platform and run behind it! We would have also thought about sex, the same way you do!! private and exclusively 4. I love all the hot men on my profile! Yes! they are just too hot to handle!</p>
<h1>GCI- Just one question...what is the tag of Bisexual doing in ur hashtags?!</h1>
<p>P.S- U can check the post no. 7021 and can take ur cup of inspiration from that if u feel so!</p>
