<p>hello admin
while I'm listenning to wanting qu's song 'you exist in my song', I'm writing about my problem to you. I think I'm dealing with a psychological issue, this may sound ridiculous and I can't share my thoughts with others otherwise they'll make fun of me, I hope you too all will not make fun of me. This is not my fault, since I cannot control my thoughts, what I can do is repress them once they pop out of nowhere but as freud said that when you repress your thoughts, they remain repressed deep under your unconscious mind which can later cause a lot of psychosomatic problems.
SO here I go, whenever I look at a guy, say I am walking and I come across a manly guy, I just can't control my mind, it feels like my mind is reading out the commands "go grab him!" "look at his groin, grab him, tear his pants off and take him in your mouth" "go and suck the hell out of him" "you are as stupid as fuck, you can't even seduce a guy, go and just seize him like he is your property, I know that all you want is dicks" , "dicks dicks dicks, that's what you want all the time" "yeah, now you're looking at him, isn't he hot, his hair, you wanna play with his hair and then we all know what you wanna do". </p>
<p>Some of you might be laughing right now and this actually sounds funny, I know but that's how the situation is, I look at guy and all I want is to take him, suck his dick and pleasurise him" I do harbour sexual desires but I don't think these are my desires, it feels like an unknown entity has acquired my mind and wants me to do these things, it's seriously not me, I know that. I fear if I share this issue with any person or any professional, they might make fun of me, they might judge me, I sometimes cry because I know it's not me, I can never desire that anyone should be subjected to my unwelcoming sexual advances. Feels like my mind is just out of my control, sometimes when I'm studying, my mind starts to form mental images, mental images of dicks, not one but several, me pasteurising others. I have tried to repress my thoughts, I have to tried to avoid these thoughts but they are so strong, it's just unavoidable.  I hope you all will understand my situation </p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, how long has it been since you got laid? I honestly don't know what you condition is. I am not a psychologist(something that I want to study besides engineering) so I cannot fully say anything about it. I know I will be repeating it again but you can speak to someone who is a intelligent in this field, to break it down for you. Thereby, the said person will tell you more about it and how to curb your feelings.</h1>
<p>I am really sorry that I couldn't be of any help at the moment. </p>
<p>PS- In the meantime, just don't loose your control.</p>
