<p>As a child whenever we would visit our hometown there was thus "uncle" who enjoyed watching us kids naked. I remember to this day when he humiliated one if my cousins who was 10 yrs old then by asking him to get naked and parade around. This along with countless time he touched my penis. He would find bizarre reasons to touch us like "you've scored a goal in the soccer game" and he would grab my penis. I felt disgusted and told my mom and her reply was "the next time he does that tell him that you'll complain about it to your parents" and this magically worked and thank her for making me stand up on my own. What shocks me now is that all the other adults in the house would laugh it off as a joke or  join in and crack jokes about the humiliation of their own children. Mind you the girls had to face this too. I'm a proud gay guy now and I'm 26. A doctor by profession, I volunteer to provide health education specially in schools and I never miss to  educate the children and the teachers about child abuse and bullying. I had a chance to confront him recently and believe me he didn't like what I had to say...haha slap on your face you paedophile lecher!!</p>
