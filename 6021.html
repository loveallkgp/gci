<p>I'm really fed up , that some of my juniors got to knw tat I'm gay, I'm studying in hongkong &amp; those guys are from Kerala and Dubai, start making fun in the Cafeteria and whenever they see me in classes! They start spreading it too everyone, I really lose my confidence &amp; all my happiness vanishes  I dont know how to face them. I really must overcome them, as I'm senior and got some friends they will stay away when they see me with my friends.  Help me with it, its kjnda bullying, I really hate that mallu race coz of them. I've seen in my eyes pointing me and telling it to others, I'm not happy bcoz of them, help me. I really wanna die bcoz of their bully act!</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, this is something serious. First, get to know the status of LGBTs in Hong Kong. From what I know, homosexuality is not a criminal offense in Hong Kong. Moreover, in government observed institution, discrimination based on any ground is an offense. This does not hold to private institutions. Moreover, check if your school has safe space laws. If it does, then you can directly go and complain about those bullies. Otherwise if they got to know, just stand tall and tell them, "So fucking what? You got a problem with homosexuals? Well don't worry, no one is gonna come near you because you are disgusting anyway." DO NOT let those fuckers get to you!</h1>
