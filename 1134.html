<p>I have seen numerous people declaring themselves as gays, in fact, we all have. Being an Indian i can understand the hardships that a gay relation would suffer. But does it mean that we should engage in a relation, exploit him and later depart just by saying that we don't stand a future!! Not being a cry baby or demanding but just want to tell some that if you seek just physical satisfaction, be clear about your intentions because there are some that being gay is not just a part time pleasure but its who they really are... I am a gay, i recently met a guy and he was so desperate to kiss all the time which was really awkward. we shared a good bond. it was just 3 months and he spilled out his desire for intimacy on bed. when refused, within a day or two he said 'we dont stand a future'! I loved him with my all, after all this i tried to make him understand but it all went in vain. No grudges but still memories kills everytime. C'mon! Stop hiding behind your lusty attitude! The day you get naked, you'll realise how does it feel to be used... Anyways, thanks for making me stronger... Nothing else to say...</p>
<h1>Viv- As i said earlier once, the guys who fake relationship just for sex are much more pathetic. At least the guys who seek sex are honest with what they want.</h1>
