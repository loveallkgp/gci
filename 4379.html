<p>I' ve got a huge crush from a guy from my college. He's just super cute. I just added him on fb.
Yesterday, to my surprise, his status read, 'good evening all gays'. That was his real id and he's supposed to be straight. Is it possible that he's using a fake id and by mistake he uploaded the status in his real id? The status got deleted after sometime.
Other possibility is that someone hacked his account and wrote that. But why would anyone write that. There are lots of other things to do when you hack someone's account!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Wow, so much thinking on one single thing. It could just have been a typo as far as I think. Or the autocorrect mistake.</h1>
