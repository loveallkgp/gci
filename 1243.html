<p>hey friends...
i have a cousin who is of my age....when we were younger we had sex wheneva we met.....infact we wtarted having sex at age of 12...but at that time we did not know about gay...we did kissing and a little sucking...as we matured we continued till 2011. after that we did not met...recently i chatted with him and asked him " tera lund utna hi hai yah kuch bada hua" he replied " ho gya bada" then i said " mere se toh chota hi hoga" he replied " u sound like a gay" i said main aise hi puch rha tha and he said ok..i mean he was very casual...he talked about doing sex with girls...but he did not say that he want to have sex with me...it seemed so awkward to ask him for a maekout...there seemed to be a void created...what to do now guys?? i mean i feel shy in directly asking him for makeout specially after his reply (u sound gay).
so should i stop thinking of having makeout with him...we both are of same age...21...and i want to kiss him...he will be coming my home in june holidays....so can i ask him during dese holidays?? what if he says no?? or else sau are a gay?? i can't reveal my sexuality to him...
help me..
viv plz give a suitable advice.</p>
<p>$ABBY : ofcourse young men do these thing as for joy .. but now he is all grown up and he knows what he wants and from whom he should get that ... so ... move on.</p>
