<p>Hi everyone, 22 yr old here. I love this page a lot and missed it so much the last few weeks. This is my first confession here.</p>
<p>Well, I came out to my parents a few months ago. It gave me a great sense of satisfaction and relief. Ok my dad thinks I'm crazy but my mom is pretty supportive. I told her about my gay friends, fake account, calls and chats with gay buddies... She listens to them all patiently, but she's still not comfortable with my sexuality yet. She keeps hinting at having grand kids. Though I feel she'll eventually accept me. My dad's never been a big part of my life, so screw him.</p>
<p>I dream about getting my bf, a special man just for me. He'll be there for me, to guide me and take me through life. Now comes my doubt, you see I watch a lot of porn where I usually think I'm the top. But recently when one of my friends asked me the qualities I need my man to have, he said that I should be looking for a top and I should always be a bottom. So this worries me coz I gotta know what I'm looking for. I've had a few hookups in the past, where undressing and body play alone excited me, I never felt any emotional connection with the guy afterwards. I still keep in touch with them just for courtesy sake. Don't get me wrong, I'm no sex addict.</p>
<p>What do you ppl think? Give me some ideas dear admin.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well sugarbomb, notice the difference between a hookup and a date. Hookup is when you just have sex once, or maybe twice, if you are lucky. Some people turn hookup into dating and start a relation. When you go for dating, you actually talk with the other person about his interests and his personality, and share a quality conversation. That should be good enough for first date. Don't go for sex alone. If you want to be with a person then wait and see how compatible you are with each other.</h1>
