<p>Bitter truth of Gay life in Indian society:</p>
<p>We all remain busy throughout the day with respective works. Whether you're a straight, bisexual or Gay, Everyone is busy with his life...work, responsibilities, career, future aspects etc. But then at the end of the day, we all need a companion to share our thoughts with. With whom you can share your success, your failures...happiness and sorrows...a person who is just yours. Someone who can listen to your problems without any judgemental view on them. A Soul Mate u can say.</p>
<p>Married guys(sexual orientation doesn't matter) are lucky in that. Straight or bisexual guys committed to someone also know with whom they'll share things. But what about Gay community, after work we go to cruising places in hope to find someone to have fun with. If u find someone of ur choice then its ok but if not u come back tired and disappointed. At the end of the day u always find urself alone. Sometimes feel like aren't we living a life of a prostitute?</p>
<p>Don't know why we people are afraid of commitment, one day u sleep with one and next day u look for someone else. This is the reason why society doesn't respect the gay community. The mother nature made us gay, it wasn't our choice then what could be the problem of society. Nothing, but The problem is that we ourselves are not loyal to each other.</p>
<p>If you yourself dont respect people of your community why would others. My thoughts are wandering now, don't know why I'm writing this crap, i think i also need someone now. Just felt like so did it.</p>
<p>At last a line is coming to my mind</p>
<p>Khud ko samet'te huye din sara guzar jata hai,
Hawaa shaam ki chalti hai to fir bikhar jata hun main........</p>
