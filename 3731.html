<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am a 28 yrs old guy. I became aware of my sexuality during my teens but I always suppressed my feelings.
I concentrated on my career to pull away the thoughts of my orientation. I topped my university and got a job in the reputed software MNC as a software engineer.
Life was moving on as planned and after 2 years my company sent me to Germany at a client location, at this time I was preparimg for GMAT. This is were things went wrong.
Company had sent another colleague with me. He was of my age, good looking, straight Punjabi guy. We shared an apartment in Frankfurt.
I never interacted with this guy when we were at the offshore as we were in the different teams. Things were fine for first 3 months. 
I socialize easily with strangers and by this virtue I made many friends in Frankfurt. I used to party with them every weekend and my colleague used to sit at home doing nothing.
Over the time I realize that he is sad and he would skip dinner on several occasions. Hence I made a effort to make him feel at home.
I started inviting him to the outings with my friends(all straight friends). Over a period of time he became quite friendly.
Then one faithful night we went to a bar and had too much of alcohol. While coming back he caught my hand in middle of busy street and said "I love you yaar".
I was high and I took it as a joke. When we went home he closed the door and came straight to my room and smooched me. I don't know what happened to me. I let myself loose and responded to his smooches and we had sex.
When I got up in the morning I realized  it was a mistake. I got ready for the office and left my apartment before he was up. That day he didn't come to office.
Whole day I cursed my self for letting myself go weak without a thought. In the evening I went home with an anxiety of the future events.
As I opened the door he came and hugged me and said "I love you". I didn't respond. I didn't know how to react because he was straight I had seen him flirting and making out with chicks in  the office parties.
But he came close to me and said " I really love you. I mean it" and smooched me and I gave in. This time we made love not under the influence of alcohol. He was really passionate and an excellent kisser.
And we hit the road as couple. We starting behaving as couple. He made me feel special. It was not just sex but everything. His caring nature, his boldness, his innocence, his voice..everything inch of his soul screamed that he loved me.
He would make breakfast for me every morning, smooch me in public( we were in a gay friendly country), we used to make out eve in the office...God I was in love!!
But as they say all good things come to an end, so did my love story.
After my project was over I had to come back gto India. He was supposed  to come back a month after me.
My last night in Frankfurt was just full of sex.. we fucked whole nite.. I had only an hour's sleep. When I got up I found that cab was about to arrive in an hour.
I woke him up and asked him to get ready. When it was just 15 mins for the cab to arrive he said " wont you say bye top my cock?"
He unzipped and i sucked him, he fucked me and when the cab arrived we were done.
At the airport he kissed me and I touched his zip and found him hard. I asked him "what turned you on here?" he said " Women turn me on".
I ignored this statement and boarded the flight to India.
After I came back he started avoiding my messages on FB, office communicator, cellphones. I thought he must be busy.
After a month he came back to Indian and joined office. When I saw him he just said "hi" and went to his seat. I was getting crazy with his behavior.
He avoided me like plague. I didn't get the reason of this stone cold behavior and I was getting insane which was reflected in my behavior and my work was getting affected.
After 3 months I was able to corner him alone in the office. I asked him the reason for such an behaviour and he said he is straight and he liked women.
I was just a " FUCK" for him. I tried to reason with him but he pushed me away and asked me to stay away from him.
Next morning when I arrived office  people started giving me  strange looks. I realized that people are cracking homosexual jokes around me. Then I came to know that he had told his office friends that I was gay.
I confronted him and he said " you know you have a very sexy ass that needs a cock".
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This was the guy who tried so hard to convince me that he loved me and now he is here right in front of me, insulting me.
I couldn't take it. I went home, took a bottle of alcohol and a razer. I poured down the alcohol down my throat. i went to the terrace of my building and cut my wrist and jumped from the 6th floor.
After 3 days I opened my eyes. I was still alive but had a femur fracture, ribbed fracture..completely shattered body.
My family managed to hush up the event. Few days later a friend of mine spoke to me and said she knew about my affair with a guy( she read my diary which I had kept it hidden in my room).
she told me that she tried to call this guy many times but he refused to come and see me. He told her " marta hai toh mare tumahar dost.. mere koi lena dena nahi hai usse".
He left the city and went to Delhi( his  friends told me). He has blocked every possible connection.
I had to undergo multiple surgeries in a span of one year and I am still struggling to walk. I this one  year I almost lost my job, lost my savings( I was on loss of pay for a long time and phisyo and medicine has made me broke) and lost trust in fellow men.
 Last week my school friend visited me. My school friend has joined XLRI and he was showing me the pictures of his college event and I spotted a familiar face.
I saw "him" in some of the pictures, merely dancing around a hot girl.I asked my friend about "him" and my friend told me that " he" was his classmate pursing MBA in XLRI.
So today here I am trying to learn to walk again, my dreams of studying abroad being shattered, lost confidence and fearing to keep faith and there he is pursuing his dream and climbing up the ladder without noticing the people at the bottom of the ladder.
Every time when I think of this and try to reason  what went wrong. I feel I made a mistake of not thinking rationally. Love is blind and blindness makes you disabled.</p>
<h1>GCI- If this story is true, the my dear brother, my heartily condolences to you. I really felt bad after reading this. Just speechless.</h1>
