<p>hey admins
Today I wanna share an event of my life. I'm an openly gay in my college and most of the people know about me. Some tease me but I really don't care about them.</p>
<p>Now, in december I was looking for the 377 judgement and because of that I was excited that finally everyone like me will have their freedom. Judgement time came and went and it had me shattered to pieces. I wasn't able to look in my face in the mirror and spent all day crying. My friends were calling me all day because I didn't went to college. Mom and dad were with me and supporting me. The next day when I went, I felt every eye scanning me. I heard someone say something rude. Then my friends came to me and hugged me tightly and said, "We are so sorry for you but tu himmat mat haar saaley tere sath hi hain hum. Koi tere ko kuch keh nahi sakta" I just wanted to feel a human other than a criminal and they made me feel one. When I entered my class there was a complete silence and again I felt being x-rayed by every pair of eyes but I sat with my friends. There were people who directly came up to me and talked about it and said that they support me. That really uplifted my mood.</p>
<p>Guys, I wanna ask that should we really have to feel criminals just because the law makes us? Are we not better than those two faced hypocrites that claim that they are always better? Should we not live our life as equals with dignity as every heterosexual couple? 11-12-13 changed my entire life. I am more passionate about my rights, our rights. Please bring out this change in yourself too.</p>
<p>Delhi</p>
<h1>Viv- Its like you poured out your heart here. Stay strong buddy. Your life is an inspiration to many people here. And of course we do deserve equal status but now the road to justice is tough now but we will definitely reach there. Love you buddy and take care.</h1>
