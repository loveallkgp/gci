<p>its not a confession. instead m using it as a platform to find someone. I'm 23 male from dehradun. I was at the dehradun railway booking counter sometime back. two guys walked in. one of them was a cute twink. we exchanged glances a lot of times. then there was a point where it continued for 3 continuous minutes. I became sure he was gay/bi. I wanted to approach him but then I told myself 'dude, ease off!" so nothin happened. I really wish if he's reading this, just comment here. I'm rahul sharma :D</p>
<p>$ABBY : ha ha and you think he might be here ... e have only 4833 members and half of them are from outside india.  crores of people live in india ... well lets take chance maybe he is here :P</p>
<p>okay all gays whenever somebody in buses and trains see you with compassion and you too like them please make move :) :) ..</p>
