<p>Okie so its gonna be long ...!!! :P
So kindly bear with me .</p>
<p>Background:
Am a 18yrs old lanky lad , who fell for a guy at a mere age of 16 and the guy whom I fell for was like one two three four ..oh yah... 21years of age.. not a conventional handsome types eye candy but a sober "the common Indian man" types person ...so it was like I was new to this gay thing and I met this guy through my real I'd ....and the same thing went on, he got started with his chavilric replies and unfortunately I went head over the heels for him -<em>- (yah not my fault ..I was just 16 come on)....then the problem started when I started loving him like the karan jahor's saucy romantic eternal love story having two lovy dovy couple with a happening ending...but I failed to understand that it was real life ....he was Muslim and had lost his father at an earlier age ..so having only his mother as a lone companion and going against her will is like what (short of words)
I don't know whether he liked me or not but still when I proposed him , he was hesitant to proceed with a relationship has his orthodox family and specially his mother won't approve of it....because of this he was enable to accept me and used to remain tensed always so we decided to part away :/ though unwillingly ..!!! So the story has ended (-</em>- not a happy ending)</p>
<p>Now the problem:</p>
<p>He is very much active nowadays with guys with all random hook ups and all ....I don't have a prob becuz its his life , and I don't want to interfere in anyone's life but on the other hand like a dumbass -_- I still love him but I maintain my distance from him as I don't want to spoil his family life... !!!
Many guys in this duration of time have approached me like interested and all but I have been like "guys doors closed try ur luck on the adjacent one :/"</p>
<p>Am still hanging in the same spot -_- all my hormones have taken a downward dip .... even the hottest gay of my school doesn't turn me on ... am being a stereotypic " one man one love wala psychic ??" And from a extrovert happy Dave, i have now become an anti social tom..!!!</p>
<p>Question: what should I do ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for ur advice .</p>
<p>dil walo ki Delhi ^_^ ...!!!</p>
<h1>Viv- Okay, so that guy is like many other guys who are scared of relationships but can hook up with any other guy for fun and he will settle down with a girl(for which he must not be blamed to an extent). So, forget him as early as possible. Let your door be opened and enjoy the attention if you get it. It will really help you to lift your mood up. BTW, you can keep your "one man one love wala nature" intact. There is nothing wrong with it. And you really need to socialize. Or if you'd still find it difficult to socialize, start writing a diary. You have excellent writing skills, honey. ;)</h1>
