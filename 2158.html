<p>I m a mature gay, 32 year old, and I want to confess that now I m a sex seekar only,
I tried a lot to find a lover or partner, but in vain,
I m not blaming anyone, it may be I m not a perfect person for relationship or love,
I m not gud looking, just average,
so people come and use me just for their needs,
and finally I have accepted myself as a sex seekar bottom, who can do anything for a top,</p>
<p>but still I m worried as growing old means getting lesser person for sex,
am I on a wrong way,
and also I dont want a relationship now as I feel I m a character less person</p>
<p>god save me from ever haunting lust </p>
<h1>GCI : see i can't help here as everyone here is saying they are not good looking and that's why people are rejecting them . don't mind me but if you want love why don't you find it in a person who also thinks that they are not good looking .</h1>
<p>a person never gets something after which he is running crazily .</p>
<p>don't become a sex seeker . nobody gave you life of lust you chose it . i don't know how to find love , and where to ..coz if i knew i wasn't single either . but all i can say that be what you are looking in others.</p>
