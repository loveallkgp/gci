<h1>GCI- Well if he likes you just as you are, then I guess there is no option for you to feel bad about yourself. Also, you do not have to overthink about meeting, sex or other blabbity blah. Just let things go on their own pace and see if they work out or not. You don't have to define it as a relationship until you both are ready. The dating phase is without any promises or word keepings.</h1>
