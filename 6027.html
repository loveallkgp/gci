<p>Dear Admin,</p>
<p>Me at this point, so depressed with personal life, financial and professional life, did seek a psychaitrist help(whoz known to be gay friendly) and wrote everything on paper(believe me I compiled that paper for 10 days so as to ensure that I never left anything behind). He after reading that, gave a huge laugh at me and humiliated me with harsh words, he then forworded that to one of his best friends who works in my same company. I came to know about that through the other person in my office as he said "don't act as if you are ok. I know the real you the doc said to me everything.. Learn how to live lyf first you poor thing " How come a person be like this?? What can I do know? I'm so embarrassed. Please help. He did not sign any confidentiality bond or something. I'm even scared to put a case against him.</p>
<p>Pl advise.</p>
<h1>GCI- What type of psychiatrist did you see? You can sue his ass, you know. Confidentiality bond or not, but they are not allowed to reveal anybody's detail to anyone. It is by default. It is a part of their training! It should be according to your consent if your condition is to be revealed to someone outside the treating team. Seek a help from some NGO on this case. You cannot let this go easily.</h1>
