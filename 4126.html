<p>Hi guys,
I am gay man with big dreams and a lot to achieve in life. About 7 years before someone used me one time sex luring me to believe that he was in love with me. After that I was never able to trust anyone let alone love. But I never give up on making friends. I met this guy, say X, online. We kept talking online and otherwise because he was in Goa and I was based in Delhi. I never thought we two could get anywhere beyond friendship. One day he told me that he is in love with me. As we all know, after few conversations 90% gay guys here fall in this so called "LOVE". So I never paid attention to that. I never wanted to lose this friendship. I liked his company. So I played along. But I was never truly in Love with him. But he definitely is. We met few times, had sex, but I miss that connection. Even he has realized this. I really want to work things up with this guy. I can never find anyone in my life who could love me so much. Can you guys please advise what to do? I value everything about him. I might be selfish before but I am not anymore. Please guys help me. </p>
<h1>GCI- Picture that he is dead. What would be your first thought? How would you feel? Trust me on this, you are missing that connection now but if you loose him, you'd miss him day and night. If he is true in his love then you will not have anyone like him for a long time.</h1>
