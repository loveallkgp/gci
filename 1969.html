<p>Dev Singh here again :-</p>
<p>I don't wanna take anybody's names specifically . But I would to to thank all of u guys for your comments ... and jaidip ... thanx man ....</p>
<p>Last night I was just reading your comments and after that I finally cascaded all my emotions through my eyes . I was just wondering . I was crying because of a rainy cloud ..... I think I should rather enjoy my life instead of wasting my life crying for something which I don't have . Obviously I do miss love . But m damn sure facebook pe I will one day find my man ....</p>
<p>You love is not about running behind it but love is about allowing love to chase u .....</p>
<p>so hence forth .. no rona and no dhona .... just masti all the time .. yup but the hunt is still on . So all the tops down there can apply for the job of being my bf ....</p>
<p>Thank u so much friends .. thank u . For taking me out of such a night mare .... now no more posts for love . But the hunt is still on ....</p>
<p>GCI ... dude we Guys are friends ... agar ik friend dusre friend ko emotionally support nai kare ga tho kon karega ... you should have had give your part of advice </p>
<h1>GCI- Buddy, if I had given my advice, trust me it would not have been that good. I have seen your each and every activity that's why I held my views within me. The page would have been wrecked if I had said something.</h1>
