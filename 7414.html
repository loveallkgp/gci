<p>He came in my life like a gust of wind. And as he left the place where my heart was, was left vacant. We never really talked to each other. Things were so different when he was around. I could feel him around me. I still very clearly remember the first time I caught him looking at me. I can still feel the first time I heard his voice echo in my ears. The way he'd steal glances of me is still fresh as anything in my mind and the relentlessly watching me when I used to talk to others. I still live that one day when our hands were into each others and both of us willing to talk a million words but not a single one coming out of our mouths; the struggle was real. However we did not necessarily need words to communicate. Our reckless eyes were enough to know what the other one was feeling.
I've had crushes before too but this was nothing like that. He was not the most gorgeous boy and if you honestly ask me when he came in question no criteria mattered. Only he mattered. It wasn't a typical attraction you have on someone that goes away with time. It had so much more with him that I just cant put into words.
It's been around a couple of years and there hasn't been a single day I haven't thought of him. I feel like a month of knowing turned out to a heartily relation for life. I am still mad at him for what he did to me. But I still want to tell each and every feeling I have for him and tell him that I was sorry.
I'm afraid I'll be spending my whole life loving a man who doesn't even know my name and probably doesn't even think about me. To some it might sound crazy and foolish and late teen crush but trust me, I've felt love and I know what I'm talking about. Maybe we weren't meant to be together after all but I swear if it's not him, no one's been made for me. 
If I ever get a chance to meet him, all I'll say is "Sorry" and then never EVER talk to him again.</p>
<h1>GCIL- What a strong undertone of 19th century romanticism....cool.</h1>
<p>Now come to the 21 st century and start editing ur feelings and emotions coz it took half the page to describe one single thing.</p>
