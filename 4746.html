<p>Dear CGI,
I'm Ronald from imphal. I'm not good in english but m trying to improve my writing skills. If i made any mistake, please forgive me.</p>
<p>I've crush on someone who is ma fb's best friend. I'm middle lookin person and he do a little better looks than me. We talk each and every single day on the phone since we have met. I felt alone when we missed a single day of talkin. He'd care for me and i'd care for him just like two lovers . I want him to be ma BF and i wish he too want me as his BF (m sayin this according to his acts). But i didn't say anything related to love when we r talking. But now I want to express my feeling to him... Is there a way that i can express what i feel? Please help me!</p>
<h1>GCI- Of course! Go on day out, and say that to him when the sun is setting. But first make sure that he feels the same way.</h1>
