<p>Ever since i got to know i'm gay (sixteen). Falling in love with a straight guy. I speculated why i'm so. I thought i remained in my house, didnt play outdoor games, didnt ve the exposure with guys and that's why i became gay. The guy i loved started emotionally abusing me. He'd touch my hips and insult me that i'm his whore and all. (i did mistake tellin him i loved him). I didnt know it was permanent but when it hit me i got very very scared. Mostly due to my strict father. I still fear it what if he gets to know. He's very caring otherwise but he values extended family a lot. And would mind people perceptions. This dilemma has caused me so mental anguish that i'm unable to live my life. Work to my full potential. For eg, i was a school topper till 10vi class continuously. But ever since i ve known i'm gay i'm just barely hanging on in twelfth and in graduation.. I used to fear a lot since childhood due to my father's strictness. And this fear in my subconscious makes my life harder. It's not an open or very visible fear. It's just inside my subconscious. Plus since my bro would beat me in childhood pure out of malice , i hate him a lot too. Infact i blamed him for five years for making me gay. Cozhe was the reason i didnt go out when i was small. Today, i know that my reasoning was wrong. That whatever emotional and physical abuse my straight friend and my bro did, is not coming back, and my father did an error on being extra strict and criticizing coz his son's mind was not made for this. But still i've not been able to live my life fullest. And it kills me from inside. I want to work hard. But it seems foolish to even try.</p>
<h1>Viv- Foolish to even try? Come on! You have this only chance to prove yourself! Once you move out, you are gonna be independent and after that you will live your life the way you want. Work for that. You have to set a goal for YOUR independence. Trust me, when you will earn yourself, live the way you want, you will never be a slave to anyone anymore. Also, you yourself do not want to be the slave. Just try and try hard.</h1>
