<p>hii
iam raghu 23 years of age i stay in delhi . There are 2 gays in my block who are  disturbing me for no reason they even said they would like to have sex wd me . I am not openly gay in the first place . coming to the guys they are really following me everyone knows that they are sex seeker . I cant go for a random guy so i said no they got pissed and start abusing me and saying me sarak chap and all i got so angry that without any reason they are humiliating me touch me inappropriately in the market itself they are so open i felt disgusted this is not done . These people are disgrace to our community. Assault is not acceptable. they  are so down market and ugly people and even abusive . i felt so bad today i actually wanted to slap that ugly bastard but due to my reputation i didnt do that. all i can say i felt disgusted. In india saying no is a big problem thats why our India is regressive and cannot grow!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Dont blot the whole gay community for that dear...morons and aresholes like these are everywhere...'KILO K BHAAW ME MILTE HAIN ESE SASTE LOG'...</h1>
<p>Chill.....just make sure u stand for urself and revert back when required!
India needs people who are 'educated' in the real sense..pseudo intelligence and superficial maturity are to be dealt by all of us!
But one thing I will say what if the same had been done by goodlooking men????</p>
<p>P.S- TO all those who envy or think good looking people have it all...they go through this too..THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE..SO CHECK OUT WHETHER UR GRASS IS GREEN OR COLORLESS....STOP BOTHERING ABOUT OTHERS!
Be  better humans and not better gays..PERIOD!</p>
