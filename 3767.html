Hie everyone
Iam 23+
Student
Im using this fake facebook acoount from last 4 years n between this time i met with few guys specially from chandigarah n new delhi.at the begning i was afraid to meet with delhites bcz i heared tht they just need sexual satisfaction nthng more thn that.but i thnk it is correct bt only to some extent.every finger is nt same.i dnt hv much gay frnds bt i hv very few very very few gay frnds n i thnk they are amazing.i just want to say thnx to them for being wid me in every sphere of my life.
ADMIN i need ur suggestion.
Whn i was new on this id i always looked for a stable relationship wid a guy bt as the time passed n this tym im nt looking for a relationship,dnt knw why bt this tym i dnt want a bf bt yes if sm1 will approach me n if he will seems to me decent thn i will surely go wid him.
Nt the question is tht why m nt looking for a bf nw ncz m the same who was looking for a bf sm years ago.</p>
<h1>GCI : there is no such compulsion to keep on seeking a bf . igo with your instinct . maybe you are tired of seeking that now you no longer want to seek but want to happen it naturally .</h1>
<p>so my suggestion would be  enjoy your single status .. meet people and if someone decent proposes you and fits your criteria ... go with him.  :)</p>
