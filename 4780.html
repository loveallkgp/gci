<p>in reference with confession no. #4767 admin replied " # GCI- I read a story on a page that a person once,:who was gay, got married to a girl but he wasconfused about his orientation just like you are. So he got married but on the first night only he realized the mistake that he did. You can be
bisexual but from your confession it appears likeyou never really gave it a thought. At one point;even I wanted a wife and kids but deep down I knew that I couldn't carry it. Acceptance is hard but if you do that, your life will be pretty easy."</p>
<p>It's not like tht...I gave a thought about everything, I had GF earlier in my life for 1.5 yr, but we split up due to our family pressure. ..in this period whn I talk to her on call in night (twice in a year) I got erection, while fantastizing her. even I tried to mistribute while fantastic her with me, and I succeeded. .... Even I m getting internally feeling tht I can carry my life with wife n children. ...
so in case still I would be consider as gay or bisexual? plz suggests???</p>
<h1>GCI- You already know the answer to that, don't you?</h1>
