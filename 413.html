<p>This is my 3rd Confession :)
Hence I am still happy with my guy and we always spend quality time together for movie, dinner, long ride, a beer, clubbing and meeting up for long chit chats and some quarrels too hahaha. Met him last this morning because he's travelling long for work and I would be travelling too shortly. Well kinda sad because it would take some months to meet up again but at the same time I'm glad that we are giving space to each other which is very significant in relationships.
He is a person who don't compromise his work and thats what I love about him yet he always make time available for me.
The last advice I gave him today is to work out abit in gyms because his belly is becoming a family pack hahahaha .....well I'm a very very body fitness concern dude ;)</p>
