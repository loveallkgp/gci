<p>i am obese, i look ugly, i look old (i am 19) my hair's getting all white, you can already spot few deep lines on my forehead and skin beneath my eyes is dark and worse. i lost my attractiveness from early age and that's why you know people don't talk with me, i am a gay(i just feel so.. i never had a crush on any guys and i am still virgin) but i never got a guy who is there to talk with me. so you know , i spent so many years in this loneliness that now i no longer feel the urge to have sex, i stay quiet, go to park and sit there for hours and think nothing, i spend my time reading books all day and study a lot. i think i will spend my life alone without any companion, my friends are just books, t.v., internet and binoculars (i see birds through them)...i am writing my feelings here.</p>
<h1>Viv- Although you didn't ask for the suggestion, I have to write something. I just can't stop it. Have you seen the documentary of an Indian plane that was hijacked? Or have you seen the condition of people who survive a natural disaster? Or have you talked with cancer survivors? One thing that all of these people can tell you is that every little thing that you have in your life is appreciable. Even if it is the mere air you are breathing with a healthy body and a sound mind. So whatever you wrote is not even an issue. People live with far more problems in their lives and yet they learn how to survive and make the best of it. Now, the question is, can you?</h1>
