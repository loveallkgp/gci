<p>Hey I am Aaru , a school student. i made a fake Id last year which is now not active. I talked to many people over there and yes someone very special to me . I Love him a lot and so do he.We've never met but still we have a very special relationship. We both want to live our lives together.It's been 7 months of togetherness . He has always been nice to me, Always been there as a support. He is my best friend with whom i would love to spend my life.It's not like that he is a creep or something but sometimes he asks for my shirtless pics . I always deny to share such things and he always says 'No Problem'. We don't have a Typical baby type relationship which is the best part of it.But sometimes i feel like he is suppressing his emotions or he is not open to me.He still loves me no doubt on that but i feel like he is changing to make me happy which is actually making me unhappy.</p>
<h1>GCI : as i say when having doubts clear it with the person . what can we tell here from these few lines . nothing .</h1>
<p>so you know him from 7 months . go to him .. talk to him about his ants and feelings he has been hiding . ?? ofcourse only he can tell that . we can't</p>
