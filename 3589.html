<p>Guys, what would you do if you go out and you find quite a number of guys staring at you? 
See, I'm not someone hungry for sex. I believe in having that one special boy :) Romance and love r my idea of Life and sex is part of love. So I'd be doing sex with the one I love and who loves me back. Hope u got what m trying to say.
So, I get on the street and many boys from the shop would stare at me. I ignore it but to some i stare back threateningly so that they start looking away.
I dunno if I really look good. Now Dont think i m some sorta stupid kid full of himself and self-obssessed shits...coz its not much like that. I take care of myself actually :) and we gays obviously are bit of self conscious of the way we look. I'm not feminine and rather someone who nobody can doubt about being gay (other than those cute guys whom i let know that i like 'em )
Now, I'd not lie that i like the attention that i get (who wouldnt ;) ) But then agian, the way they look ...i dont know if its love or just lust. 'coz even if they r into guys, m sure they act pretty straight. I dont talk to them ( mind that, if i want i can do it really easily ) as i feel self- concerned. I dont wanna be something like a toy to satisfy someone's lusty desires ! 
Due to such issues, i approach no one and dont even let anyone approach me as well. Some guys r 2-3 years older but cute :) 
Now i wouldnt have written it here as i dont like talking about myself much but i needed to write coz i was mighty confused and wanted to know what would u guys do if u were in my shoes. 
P.S. Please, if u think this is a fake things, OR is by some guy who thinks of himself as too handsome but is not OR if u dont have nothing good to contribute, then please please dont comment ! Dont like bullshit</p>
<h1>GCI- LOL! I know people stare! And when they do I just hold my head up and walk straight.</h1>
