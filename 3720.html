<p>I know my guy frm last 1yr...so last month,i accepted his reltionshp proposal...he doesnt look great but i like his simplicity and caring nature 4 me...
Last week,he asked me,'tum itne cute ho kya tumhra koi past me relationshp tha kya'
i told him yeah i had one n his face become so sad...i dint like that...genuinely i have feelings for him n strong attachment wid him...
Actually i want to confess about my past infront of him but i scare again he will b sad...
In past,i had so mny boyfrens,i forget myself how mny bfs i had..wid how many guys i hav slept n wid how many guys i did smoooching?....all these things i cnt share wid him coz i dnt wanna lose him...he is so genuine...
Yesterday i was checking his fb..i saw him he was chatting with my third last ex bf...now em really scare....kahi woh banda isko sab kch bata na de....</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, rather than waiting for someone else to tell him things about you, why don't you tell him everything yourself. At least you will be genuine and there will be no secrets.</h1>
