<h1>Viv- A real good confession here worth reading. And buddy you are really a nice person at heart. Lots of respect to you.</h1>
<p>I am a straight guy.I enrolled 11th and 12th in a college and was very reserve type of guy.Here after a few days of frustration of not making friends, 
i met this guy who sat beside me who seemed very familiar.I wanted to acquaint with him but he was moody at that time and didnt speak. 
Days passed we became frnds and i 
came to know he was from the same school where 
i did my schooling.But i never spoke to him during my school days.
We had a huge gang of about 10members. We were soo close with each other.I loved everyone in the grp, but i was attracted 
to that particular guy.I wanted to be like his most best frnd tht he could rely upon.I was stunned by his simplicity. His coolness..
his attitude..his respect towards contributed to the guy's appearence.
Year passed..We became more close in 12th.July 27th was his birthday.I was sick and was just bck from hospital on that day.
He had organised a simple party in the gang.But i was the only one missing.So he came to my house with cake, kept it by my side and sat with fr atleast 30mins and cheering me up.
Next i was called by him asking me to meet him at around 9pm..i was wondering wat could hv happened coz i didnt go to college 
fr a week..i was hugged by him and he said "Bro, I missed u loads..Where were you??"... 
When he called me bro, i was on cloud 9. Never could express my happiness....
He shared all his joys, sorrows and his dreams with me. One such dream was tht some one who could understand him to be his best 
friend forever.I immediately told him that he could contact me anytime. So once he just called and asked if i could recharge 
his mobile with 30rs...I was outside and i told i will do asap. As my work finished and rushed to 
nearby shop who was about to close and i requested to put Rs.250/- for tht number. He was stunned..Again he was in tears
I gave him keychains tht he loved..a mobile...a perfume...!!!
Then after the final exam 2months passed...It was time for the result.I had bought a bag to his house with all the gifts that i preserved for 
him when suddenly i got a call from his father telling me tht his son had committed suicide.
I broke down. I never knew this was coming. I went into depression. I was sooo emotionally attached to him and his love towards me as a brother kept on increasing till his last breath
I wanted to fulfil his dreams.I help anyone today.I recharge my frnds phone and never expect anything from them, coz i respect frndship alot. Friends have come to me with problems which i helpd solve.I get relief doing such things. He wanted to meet such person, and i was that person and i turned into
Bro...I love you soo much..I miss you...2 years with you was all i had with me.I hope i made more happy than u could ever be. I am keeping my words and your dreams. I miss you...All the work, sweat and the struggle will be only for u. Coz i love u soooo much</p>
<p>You are my greatest friend ever!!!</p>
