<p>Wish u happy diwali in advance. Love this confession page people speak upon various topics, so many intellectual guys here n admin doing a spledid work giving us such a page to express something. 
:p :p confession #3933 Germany incidence reminds me event on Global young acadamy where some students from aus, nez was expressing us why actually they dont want to come India and the quiz competition lol. I can guess who is this Mr. Confessior :p :p :p ur identity almost out :p :p dont worry my little buddy, u are doing a great job, wish u good luck for your future. I would like to request every Indian people to read the confessions #3910 and #3933, the way he was trying to give us a msg with honesty is very inspirable. To Mr. #Mahapadma Nand, sorry to mention ur name. Your comment on #3910 showing u that u very immature with lack of knowledge. Talking about inner line permits, why some special permition need to visit arunachal, talking about ULFA millitants and many more things u said made u over smart. Yes, stop writting infos, infos were wrong though. He was just trying to give us a nice msg, not coming here to debate. Many things i can explain u but i m sure it will go over your head. I dont know why some people opposed the confessions. Not a single mistake the confessior did expressing the feeling of ne people n trying to explain the real meaning of unity in diversity. Being from punjab I am telling u people of ne may poor but their affectionate mentallity n honesty is very much higher. We love u NE people, and Mr. confessior we loved ur confession. Ignore all these bullshits comments.
   and people stop pretending there's no racial discrimination towards NE people. 2 incidence happened  in last 4 days published even on newspapers of london. SHAME -_- Love everyone, spread love we are only human.</p>

<h1>GCI- I am really sad that people have to suffer through shit like racism just because of different color, race, gender or even looks. Aren't we all but humans who are capable of loving everyone?</h1>
