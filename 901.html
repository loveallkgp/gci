<p>After reading so many confession, thought of writing my own....
Here it goes...
I was in love with my close fren for 3 years...
We were so close, we go out together, do things togther, most of the time eat together etc...
So I started to fall in love with him..
But the most sad thing is, he was straight and have a g.f..
I even tried to lure him in having sex, but it didn't happen as he was straight..
Sometimes I joking say I love u but there won't be any reply from the other end..
Later, he use to get so angry with me, started avoiding me blah blah..
And our friendship start falling apart..
He was so buy with his g.f that he didn't even bother to see how hurt I was...
I use to do everything for him..do what ever he says..
After our friendship fall apart, I went to depression for almost 3 months, thanks to my fren who come to my rescue..
Now its almost 5 months I didn't see or talk with him...(I even told him not to contact me ever)
After this separation, I still think of him and dream of him, I don't know why coz I have move on..
I shifted my house far away from him but still his memoirs remain in me..
Pls guys help me guys, I want to forget him completely... What shall I do...
Sorry its long.... Pls do help me..</p>
<h1>Viv- It happens buddy.. The guy I had feelings for in my first year, he still exist in my memory. But not that much that I waste my precious time over him. I'm like, "Eh, whatever.. he was a bloody bad dream of my life and I trusted this lunatic beyond boundaries." If anything, I had experience of lifetime to not trust people so easily and be much more practical. Same thing you can do and his memories won't bother you.</h1>
