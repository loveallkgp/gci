<p>Hello all lovely people here,
I want your advice on something so important to me. Please don't judge me. I work in an IT company in Noida. I am from Punjab and came here about 3 years before after completing my studies. I was looking for accommodation and then one of my friends patched me up with this lovely guy, let's say Simran. It was shared accommodation and me and Simran shared same room just to save on money. We were quite different personalities and I find it very hard to be good friends with him. One day I opened up and offered a hand of friendship. I was glad he accepted and since that day we started growing closer. We have had some masti. One day he came out to me out of the blue. It was a big surprise to me. I never expected it. He started crying. I consoled him and told him that I am bisexual. He was utterly shocked and said that I am saying that just to make him feel comfortable. When I insisted he believed. We share every detail of our lives to each other and kept growing closer. We never knew our true feelings for each other. He had to attend a marriage in his Hometown Abohar. In that time, I missed him lot and realized that my feelings for him are more than a friend. We never had any intimate relations apart from friendly kisses here and there. I know he loves my company. I want to be with him like his bf. but I don't want to loose him. What if he rejects me and stop being friends with me. It's a big IF but I don't want to take that risk. We chat for hours and hardly go out though we both have gay friends. We love each other's company. He loves watching movies with me. And he cares for me. He often advise me not to trust anyone. If I am late he calls me million times. He has met my parents as well mad they liked him. I have met his brother and bhabhi. They both are aware that he is gay. We both are Sikhs and get along well on religious things as well.
Can you guys advise what should I do? It's very hard for me to keep on doing this.
Thanks.
Hugs &amp; Kisses
Harman</p>
