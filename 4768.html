<p>My confession.</p>
<p>I am a gay! I know what I am doing and appreciate doing it.</p>
<p>While I was chatting online on Facebook, I encountered one incident. I was chatting with a Gay Guy and he was preparing himself to start some Facebook page for Gay people and help them with something... like some Ideas and solving issues.. I don't know what exactly he was upto. However, while I was chatting with him; he presented himself as a English Scholar. He was just pointing all mistakes of mine on texts? It was strange, he was talking to me for the first time and then he just vomit all the shits of english language and then report my profile on Facebook and pufffff.. he was gone. My question is how to deal with such insane people, who thinks only they are best and are doing right things? What do you feel if someone would have just questioned, criticised you for your english. Instead of discussing the topics and the agenda, he was just looking for the mistakes I was doing? Don't you feel before we admit we are GAY, we should admit we are human? We have some responsibilities? We should be nice to people? We should look forward making people happy and ourselves?
I wish I should meet that person again and should ask - "Are you done teaching english to people or still dealing with Hinglish?"</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh he was just being a wannabe diva, that's it. You meet them, you shake hands with them, you walk away. You do not stay to talk.</h1>
