<p>I am 35 year old, bisexual, I met a guy through fb, he is 21 year who said he is a straight guy and is  desperate for sex, we met and had a good sex, after that he started chatting as if we r lovers, I told him that I am not a lover kind, only a sex seeker,, but he went on disturbing like calling again n again, even in the midnight, It become so disturbing that I deactivated my fb fake account, and switched off that phone no, after three months I switched on the no yesterday and in five minutes I got his call, 
He is almost in tears and said, I love you.and I can't live without you.
I tried to convince him that its not love, and he did not understand, he said I will suicide if you do not meet me, </p>

Also I want to know where is his straight ness 
please suggest</p>
