<p>Here on Facebook I have seen so many people who r homophobic even if they r gays. Today I had a chat with a guy who said he's top and he like to fuck but he's not a gay or bisexual. Another incident which im sharing is when I had chat with a guy who is from Philippines he said that I'm single and ready to mingle. He said that he's looking for a relationship and asked me if I'm ready for a relationship with him. And he said that he's a heterosexual guy and said that he like sex with everyone. Even he told me that he had sex with a hen ....haha...my god .....guys what you want to say about the knowledge of these ppl. Why so many ppl r homophobic.... why???????</p>
<h1>GCI- Sex with a hen?! SICK! Well these guys who proclaim to be heterosexual but on facebook are the horniest creatures alive, are the ones who are scared to admit their true identity. They just need someone to smack the truth on their faces</h1>
