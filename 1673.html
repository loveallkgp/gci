<p>25 yrs old, student. Confusd n seeking for Opinion.
Here is a guy, friend of mine who never acknowledge/identify himself as gay.
Both of us r christian n studyin in christian institution. He is very religious n superb prayerful man.
Christian scripture strictly condemn Same-Sex-Relationship.
He is senior to me in age as wel as in academic. He is sociable, expressiv, macho type n we hapn to b room mate wit 2 otr guys(4nos.). On d graduation day, one of our outgoing studnts requestd us to let his parents lodge 4 2nit in our room since thr is no guest house in our college.
Both said ok n slpt on d terrace 1st nit. In d midle of d nit both turn to each otr, hold n hug each otr. Aftr somtim he started to smooch me, hand reachn on my back n patting 4 somtim. I ws so shockd he doin ds. He kissd me on my cheek n suddenly turn to otr side. D nxt morning we got up n he said "thank god hamare ezzad pe kuch nahi hua".
2nd nit we slpt togtr in da same manner n da next morning b4 getting up he kissd me again wit erection. Noon time he beg pardon to me sayin"m sori 4 evrtn. I was thnkin somthn else n did al ds to u". We got vacation n came bck aftr 2 mnths wit strong felin 4 hm. Dis tim, v wr allotd in difrnt rum but i regularly vist hs rum n laydown on hs bed. He use to touch my lips, insert his fingr in my mouth. We furthr develop intimacy n hd oral sex almost evryday(suckin, caressin n kissin etc. Frm both side). He lv being tochd n to touch(my body n private part). He even get erection just by touchn me n me touchn hm his hands. He pre cum in large quantity just by touchn hs hands n patting hs hair. But he alwys say i imagine girl n feels ths way.
He even preach against gay in da church bt bck to hostel wit me he enjoy da act. Occassionaly he resist me to tch hs dick sayin "ds is 4 my wif" bt many tim i hv alrdy lickd it n cum it. He nitr hv GF in d past nor in d present. But nvr confes he is gay n lukin for a grl to gt marry.
He hs alrdy been graduatd n ocassional contct wit me thru cal n txt. He txt me lik Miss u, Love u bt never said
I LOVE YOU.
So wat say u? ? ? </p>
<h1>Viv- His is the proper case of denial followed by religious preaching. Now the scripture maybe clear which is against gay sex but should we strongly believe on a book that was written more than 2000 years ago? Bible also says that cutting down hair is a sin, having premarital sex is a sin and people who do that shall be stoned to death and many more commandments are there against heterosexual companionship's. Do we preach against them? No! Because we humans have the habit of suppressing others through hypocrisy. Not to insult or anything but even if you check the history of the popes, many of them has fathered children which is completely against the Bible as it clearly says that the Vicar of Christ should practice celibacy throughout life. Honestly, why do we even have to take away the freedom on some religious books, be it of any religion, who were written down by humans having a particular set of mind in that ancient era? How is that even justified for modern age?</h1>
