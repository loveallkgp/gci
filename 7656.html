<p>Hello everyone i m doing engg. And in closet. I became friend with one of my friend's(let his name be A) friend(Let his name be B). Today i read messages of A's chat with B.  Where B wrote what was my(confessor) orientation and A replied with 'Homo'. And then as B and me were talking about lgbt community B said to me that he was straight but respect every sexuality. But in his chat with A, B said he wrote me this and though unclear but i think i saw laughter emojis. Weird confession. Though i dnt knw i hav mixed emotions with this cz i m proud of what i am but i dont wanna fall in any trouble though. Weird af. </p>
<h1>GCI- Do you really have to care about it? Your sexuality is something personal to you. There are always gonna be people who will have something to say. Always. They are gonna be even in your family. Do not think much about it.</h1>
