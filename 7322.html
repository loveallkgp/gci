<h1>GCIL- Thandd rakh veere....U must break the cycle of poverty by ur meritocractic potential and then only u can aspire for other levels of self fulfillment in terms of materialism.</h1>
<p>I will say 3 more things-</p>
<p>1- Stay firm on ur stand of not marrying a girl.
2- Stay confident of 'making' ur own life, whatever it takes.
3- Do not succumb because of poverty....Oprah Winfrey and people like her became what they are by their sheer will...and yes it was from rags to riches.</p>
<p>A Very warm hug from our side. Bestest of the luck!</p>
