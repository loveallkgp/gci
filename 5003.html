<p>Hai Sky here.. Sareya nu lohri di vaddhaiya ... Happy lohri to admin n all ..
Here i m posting a joke .. to make all of u happy n stress free.. bcoz admin always post thrki senti emotional post ..</p>
<p>A handsome dude gets on a bus and proceeds to sit next to a nun in the front seat.That boy then asked the nun if she would have sex with him. Surprised,the nun politely declines and gets off at the next stop. When the bus resumes,the bus driver says to the dude ,"If you want I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you!" Dude says of course,
the driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight she goes to the cemetery to pray to the Lord. "If you went dressed in robes and glowing powder,"said the male bus driver,"you could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you!" Boy goes out the next Tuesday evening.And right on schedule the nun shows up.
In the middle of praying,
he comes out of hiding, in robes and glowing with the mask of the God."I'm God, I've heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must first give yourself to me!" The nun agrees but asked for anal sex so that she might keep her virginity. Boy agrees and quickly goes to work on the nun. After boy finishes,
he rips off the mask and shouts out,"HaHa, I'm that bus wala boy</p>
<p>The nun replies by whipping off her hood and shouting
,"Ha ha,I'm the bus driver!"...</p>
