<p>My boyfriend always miss understood me. He thinks that i love lavish life; big home, big cars and all. He never understood me. He said that my love was fake and all i did was acting so that i could use his money and all. Now I could like to say you that shut up dude. Don't you dare to say im poor, i equally paid on everything be it food or clubs. Tell me if you have so much of money why did you come to my house late night drunk during my semester examination and not your big humongous home? When you fell ill why did you call me and i had to take care off you. Why didn't you go to big lavish hospital with personal nurse to take care of you? Tell me why?? I know you will be blank because you have no answer. Somebody sparked you with this stupid lame idea and you thought he was real and so you broke up with me! Fine just remember one thing i never needed any money or big lavish house or vehicles a 1BHK room with single bed would also work for me. If you read this just give a deep thinking of what have you done and what you have said; and also for one moment don't think i cannot live without you because if i can live without my parents you are nothing.</p>
