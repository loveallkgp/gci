<p>i'm in a dilema and it has been lingering
in my mind, troubling me. i think many
have been victim of it.
My parents who hv been there for me,
always ,in every moment, bcoz of
whom i'm breathing right now;
Should i respect their words, obey
them ? get married to the gal they
are arranging for me?
OR
should i follow my instinct, wat my
heart says?
suppose i obey them and tie the knot
to that gal, wil she be happy? does
she deserve to be cheated? wil it work
suppose i tell my parents, i'm gay, wil
they understand me. are they fully
aware of what gay means. are they
ready to face the society?
will i be able to break up with my bf.
should i have extra marital affair with a
guy? what about my innocent future
wife?
which road should i take? or shall i
end the road here???
who will answer me these
questions???
i hv read that for every problem there
is a solution. Is there a solution for
this?</p>
