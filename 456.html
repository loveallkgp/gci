<p>hello admin! i am the same guy from confession#410</p>
<p>after leaving the 12th standard, i got in a fashion school. everything was so new and nice except the people around. None was the way they seemed to be when out of nowhere there comes this guy who was awesomely cool and good as hell. plus i was in my sixteen. u can imagine what would have happened. the story repeated but in a closeted way.......i kept it to myself, while another guy from my batch only who is a gay for sure( anyone can figure out at a glance) got very close to him. they started hanging out with some other girls and formed a friend circle which i was not a part of in my own right. they both ended up being roomies and i felt bad about it. Though we were just friends and there was no commitment from either side, still i felt like being cheated when he stayed there all the time and used to lie about him being at his sister's. Circumstances became worse and i was broken.....all seemed to be lost as i had fallen so deeply for him......but he was straight...it wasn't a shock but disheartening fact which i was already aware of.my eyes opened......i became reserved, selfish, tensed, aggressive and lost focus........it took me so long to get over with this............ now m out of it...........all what i learned being homosexual sometimes makes u fall in situations when you find yourself at the verge of collapse and none is there to care for you.............its unfortunate..very sad.</p>
<p>i knw i wrote too much....post it only if its worth it. plz do add ur suggestions.</p>
