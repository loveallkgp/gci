<p>Is falling for one's own dad wrong ? 
M of 27, Obviously m not a kid. But theres something i wanna share which me myself feel is wrong &amp; crazy &amp; for which i should be burned alive. 
I so want to have sex with him, my love, my dad .... Yeah m sexually &amp; emotionally attracted towards him ..... But still i haven't progressed towards him or given him any hints. N m not even planning of such. Ab sapne dekhne mai kya jata hai nah? For gratification, partner whom i have sex with, i imagine them to be my dad when they thrust my ass with their tool.
No any problem? Well there is. I have been in jealousy &amp; competition with my own mum from puberty &amp; it continues till date. Gosh, i need help i guess, medications may be. Planning to leave home; but being single child in home, its difficult. Cant leave dad &amp; cant stay with the one (mum) enjoying my love. N they r planning of my marriage. Ahhhhhhh. 
M in this war from last 14 years. Still m SANE &amp; haven't gone crazy in this war of social-norms &amp; emotional-norms ....
 Its neither Oedipus-complex nor electra-complex ..... Sigmund freud should have coined term for it &amp; explained it for shits like me.
 Sometime i wanna shout aloud yeah m abnormal ..... </p>
