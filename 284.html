<p>I had my dream come true
5 years ago I saw a boy while going to school we both exchanged looks he was damn good looking
From then we both crossed each others way quite a lot I always wished he was gay
Woh mere ghar se sirf thoda dhur rehta tha jabhi bhi him bahar jata tha woh dikh jata tha ek baar toh hm log ek hi sweet shop me khade the
And last second Sunday I chated with a guy in planetromeo he asked wanna meet I said sure and I went and wat I saw?omg!it was him we had body sex..after coming back to home i was really dancing..the next day I texted him wanna meet no reply since I m a bit egoistic I did not sent any more msg..i was very depressed i cried ....this Sunday he called me and we met and then yesterday we had a chat in PR
I asked 1 of my friend to chat and him and ask For some details and pics...after some chat my friend said he is a fake guy..I opened his profile and saw he blocked his guestbook entry now I have become more suspicious
Sorry for any wrong english</p>
