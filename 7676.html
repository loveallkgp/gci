<p>Plz admins post my confession ...</p>
<p>I live in tamil nadu I went against my whole family when I decided to go to kolkata for my graduation ...  and yes finally I succeeded...  I did not have my own flat there to stay in . So I was staying at my masi's house ..... After few weeks my dad from tamil nadu thought of making a visit to kolkata and help me to find a better college to get in ... he too was staying with me .... I don't know how but he managed to crack my phone's password  and read all sort of messages which I exchanged with my gay friend .and he then started tracing me out and discovered that I have had sex with few other guys as well .... he brought me back to tamil nadu and snatched away my phone . He then abused me , taunted me and even once slapped me .... there was hell lot of family drama in the house for atleast 3 months ... I managed it all . My parents called me a "whore " even ..  I fought back and I stood for my self . I somehow managed to do some emotional drama or notanki in front of them and managed to come back to kolkata to complete my education...  i never had friends in my school days so I used to never go out with anyone . hence after I completed my college . I came back to tamil nadu and then on I never made friends even  . Now that I have an account in grindr . Grindr had helped me to make few friends ... I m 22 now and I want to enjoy my life till the core .... I have created a scene infront of my parents saying that these gay friends are my school friends . But they are being very suspicious about me . They even still now doubt that there is something fishy about me having friends ... I don't know ... I mean m I taking an advantage of the independence I have got ?? M I doing the right thing</p>
