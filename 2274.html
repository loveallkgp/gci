<p>Our admin seems much like into every field. So to that doctor side of our dear Admin ( and others can comment down there as well ) here is one problem
I once slept with an uncle for 3 days (only slept :P m not into uncles anyways -_- ). And after that I started having itchings in my thigh and in crotch as well. Slowly the itching got worse and days later I had red patches around my thing :'( its embarrassing man. I tried many itch guard creams but no good results. Its been months but its still there... what should i try :(</p>
<p>I swear fuck that uncle with an electric pole -_- ...admin what do u say ? ;)</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, run to a fucking doctor! If skin issues are left like that, you might get a serious skin trouble. At most you have a kind of rash as a result of an STI. If you didn't use a condom, I'd advice you to get tested for HIV as well as a precautionary measure.</h1>
