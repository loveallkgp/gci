<p>ho fellas! I'm Sameer! I recognized my orientation @ a very ripe age of 10! I didn't know much about it! my parents have always concentrated on my studies rather on my personal carrer! I love them, I don't wanna hurt them by revealing about my sexuality! it's getting difficult for me to handle this extra layer of stress haunting me day by day! still virgin! I can't marry a girl! I can't even imagine! even if I want to come out of closet, I'm not really that close enough to my parents to reveal this! need some advice and suggestions! I did a lot of internet research and read this book " the divided self" , for once, I thought, the book was written for me! gr8est insight ever by R.Laing! please help me out! thanks! </p>
<h1>Viv- Even I am not out of the closet but I do feel proud of myself and because of that pride I don't feel stressed about my sexuality. See, coming out is a decision that should be done at one's ease. When you feel you won't have any complication even if your parents disown you(worst case scenario). And until that moment arrives, do not think about it and focus on something better in life.</h1>
