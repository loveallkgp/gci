<p>Hi admni..i've one serious confession...uh all here present guys wants dat gay marriage should be legalised in india.. But have anyone thought of the after effects like some tell here dat dey can adopt children or through surgouecy.. But the child who vl b brought through this male parents vl feel so odd as in meetings in school,outings.. And diz vl leave an effect.. M nt against parenting.. Bt child brought up iz nt surely classified gay he miGht b straiGht..And 90% of straights unfavour gays..admni its req.. Pls dnt justify others nly wrong bt give ur valuable suggestion.</p>
<h1>GCI- People are not born hateful. Hate is taught. When I see a group of kindergarten kids kids playing inside the school grounds here in Montreal, they all play with each other without any hesitation of what color the other kid is or how he looks like. When we speak about discrimination, it is always the reflection of family upbringing and peer activities.</h1>
<p>That being said, if a gay couple have and they turn out to be straight(which they most definitely can), the kid will learn to love if the parenting is right. And in most of the cases gay parenting is much better than straight parenting because for gay couples parenting is a dream and not a responsibility by the society. So the child can never feel bad about it. The hatred and the beauty is always in the eye of the looker. Hope you have got your answer.</p>
