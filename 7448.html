<p>Hey guys! 24M from Hyderabad. 
I am not sooo handsome or appealing :P So i rarely get to hookup with guys... But i feel that when someone gets ready to do it with you they must be polite and let their ego be aside. Others are human too. When you feel you r superior to someone then just dont do it with him. 
 I went to a guy for a hookup. He was huge but his behaviour was so narrow minded that he did not let me kiss him. I don't look ugly though. He's so insane in his thoughts and feels so superior to others that he wants to get suck but his ego would hurt even TOUCHing others. So I could not tolerate his behaviour and when he went into washroom had spill my cum alover his bed wantedly and made it dirty. :P</p>
<p>Feeling crazy. </p>
<p>I hate when people label themselves TOP only to show-off their attitude or their large penis size and their narrow-mindedness. </p>
<p>A gay person is a person who is emotionally and sexually attracted to GUYs... NOT PENISES. Heartfelt touch feels more erotic than your Geometrically large , long, huge ....dick and cheap attitude. BE MAN ENOUGH TO ASK GAY GUYS FOR A FAVOR but don't cheat them with your fake-gayness.</p>
<h1>GCI- People in denial.. taubah taubah... and when it is pointed out, they feel attacked. The only thing that they are, is being coward. It's nothing but cowardice and they think they are brave. Sigh...</h1>
