<p>hell guys hope for your brgt happy future</p>
<p>my confession is i everyday read confession posted by you all.
and i really bad when i hear about break ups betrayals and all
i feel your pain because that happened with me too and now i just lost myself bcz i jus faced all at height and dumped..we all same type of pain..
but leave you all bored of hearing this bcz everyone has their own pain too
i wanna say why we all dnt that bright future n love..why we have to get aparted because of this society..
we ourself not choosen to be this ..God made us.
so why people objects us.society is from us and we are a part of that..we already has alot of pains to be this so why society and people cant accept us
i feel we have to do like this because we are not only one who is affected ...there is alot of people who just facing this some people commit suicide and those who are alive are just broken and in pain
we also have true feelings and love so we dnt have right to live a happy life with our desired partner..
comment must</p>
