<p>Hiii friends ..... </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>         I m 19 years old , m pure bottom from Kolkata .. I m confused ... I do have a boyfriend it had been only 6 or 7 days we have met ... I don&#39;t honestly find any connection between me and him . I like him he is smart ( not the kind of a man I need ) but still he is smart . Caring and protective . I don&#39;t know what m I suppose to do . If I say him that I don&#39;t love u then he ll break up with me and i ll be alone again and if I say I love u which I have already said a billion times then i don&#39;t find any spice in our relationship ... I m not desperate . I m not at all talking about sex  &quot; when I used that word spice &quot; .. but I don&#39;t find his love in me ... even though we are from the same city .... I always find something missing in our relationship . I m unable to find my self committed to him even though I have publicly declared that m in relationship with him .... I have alleyways dreamt about . A man who is possessive , protective &amp; caring ,  handsome , with a gr8 personality , well to do with . Sophisticated , mature , well built , educated . These are the qualities which I need in my man . He is educated . I did not find him well to do with and well built .... what m I suppose to do .. I know I should give each other some time and some patiences is definitely required .. but I don&#39;t know why m I panicking ...
</pre></div>


<p>$ABBY : this is the big problem in gays .. they willl chat on internet and say i love you million times  and then after a month one of them thinks ' why the heck i am with this man .." . </p>
<p>see before actually starting relationship there is thing called dating . dating .. can be of one day , 1 week or maybe long time ... during this time two people hang out with each other , talk to each other and know about each other . if they find each other of their liking then they get into relationship. don't just throw ' i love you ' like coins ... know the meaning . </p>
<p>you have said to him ' i love u ' million times ... what he will think ...ofcourse he will think that you love him . gosh you gonna break his heart if you said you don't find the spice . 
you should have said it earlier that we will dat and then if we like each other only and only then i will say those three words that are ' i love you '.
go tell him truth .... he might start hating you for that ... but what can be done .</p>
