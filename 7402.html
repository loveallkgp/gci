<p>Heyy Mr. Admin &amp; all the readers,
I'm not here to confess something,
I'm here just to tell u guys my short coming out story,
I can't forget that Day..
So, It was around 7O'clock in the morning, I heard someone Shouting "OMG...Look at the pictures of gay couple in his phone &amp; He is having so many trans friend in his Facebook ID!!!"
I opened my eyes It was my sister who was telling all these things to Mum,
I was so scared I didn't know what to do.....
As I woke up my mum started yelling at me "Tu Gay Banega...Hizra banega...Hum logo ko kya muh dikhayenge...."
I just started crying...
Then my sister said "Mum get ready to welcome a bridegroom In your house...Coz That's what He'll do, Marry a guy!!!"
They asked me "Are you gay???"
I said "Yes...I'm and I'm not ashamed to admit it!!!"
My sister asked " So...You'll also wear saaree n all those stuff??"
I said " I'm a gay not a trans, The trans people do cross dressing, And I'm not trans!!! And If u don't have any kind of knowledge about them then u should shut the hell up bitch!!!"
Then, I went to school I was literally crying whole day...
My classmates were asking, But I said not a single word to them...
Then I came back to Home from school,
I thought the situation would be better,
But as I entered I saw my grandpa was also there n mum was telling him about Me...
As Mum ended with her words, My grandpa started shouting "Log kya kahenge, Kya izzatt reh jayegi Hamari, Log thukenge humpe, Tujhe Jada saukh hai ladki banne ka toh nikal jaanaa mere ghar se"
It was Literally The Worse Day of my life...
The Day ended with my tears...
The Next Day started, I was not feeling well,so I didn't go to school,
The morning ended &amp;The afternoon stared with their Sharp words which was hurting more than The cuts,
Then, my sis went to college n Mum &amp; Grandpa Went for shopping,
I was alone in the house,
I took a rope &amp; Tied it in the fan,
And Thought Today I will die, Suddenly My phone rang, It was Armaan bhaai, who is my bff or we can say we're Brothers from different mothers, He is also homo,
So, I picked the call up, &amp; Started crying,
"Are You Okay?..What happened to you?..baby??? are you Fine???"
I told him the whole story,
He said"Baby, We all have problems in our life, and It doesn't mean we have to give up!!! And it will take time to digest that Thing, Don't worry They'll accept u"
He gave me so much positive vibes &amp; I cancelled my plan to die...
My grandpa was not talking with me, and mum n Di were talking &amp; behaving very rudely
after that they took my phone also.. 
Day passed, They continued saying all those things to me..
After 1 Year and 2 Months my sister has finally accepted me and Now we share everything to each other...
My mum's words are still the same and grandpa has started talking to me but he has not accepted me yet!!!
I know my Story was a little bit boring &amp; I'm really very bad at writing stories,
Anyways I just want to thank evey single person who is and who was a part of my life, specially Armaan Bhaai, Vaibhaw, Kritika Singh, Amy Di, Ritu, Tara and all my girls.. I love you all...
And I just want to say Sometimes life get though, but It doesn't mean we have to give up, God has given us those problem to check our strength and to make us strong...</p>
<h1>GCIL- That's like a good boy and one more thing babes that u don't need to die of suicide because trust me dying this way will not bring anyone peace.</h1>
<p>More G power to u. And thanks to ur friends who have made u the person u r today. Kudos to them too.</p>
