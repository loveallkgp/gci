<p>Hey Admin! grin emoticon</p>
<p>I am confused! I am 19 yrs of age staying in delhi and I'm bisexual (more inclined towards guys) .. I have been here on fb since two years..Over the years i found out that I love Gay BDSM and hence i started chatting with guys here who were/are into BDSM.. It attracts me a lot but after sometime (when I jerk off), I feel a sense of regret and often i say myself that "Its not right for me" ..Then i become fearful when guys ask me for my real identity, my contact details and stuff..to which i clearly deny because I think its not the right age to indulge into these things. The fear is that i like it till a certain point only and i am just not ready for all this. I dont want to have sex ever because my conscious does not allow me..but the way its been going..i am damn fearful..
I've become a regular user here and i am addicted to this..
If you could just help me out with this smile emoticon
 Thanks!</p>
<h1>GCI- Been there, done that. Not the BDSM but guilt and regret. It will get easy buddy. Really it's not much of a worry. At this age it is more than common. One thing you have to digest is that having feelings for sex is not wrong. You body pushes you to do that. It's a human need and it's completely natural whatever you feel. Try thinking out of the box.</h1>
