<p>Dude I want to improve my communication skills please help me.</p>
<h1>GCI- U will learn it if U r here regularly.</h1>
<p>Jokes apart If u really want that then u need to consider these facts-
1- U need to build up your vocab first, including the proper parts of speech to be pitched at proper time and place.
2- U need to talk to strangers(u can start with the page members) virtually or in reality. u can start in anyway. 
3- U must not hesitate or show an overtly introvert nature while speaking. Introvert people r NOT under confident, they are just not interested enough to speak and the outcome is them being labelled unsocial.
4- U must write, read and speak i.e Writing makes a precise man, reading makes us a perfect man and conference makes us a ready man.
5- U can also try in front of the mirror first and then gradually have discussions with ur friends over something u r interested in.
6- Striking a convo is a two way process; you must know what to speak and u must also know whether u r able to retain interest in the listener.
7- Always dress up nicely, that helps boost confidence while speaking formally at occasions.
8- Communication skills take time to polish and if u are willing to get cut then only u can turn into a diamond one day. </p>
<p>P.S- Language skills are a pre-requisite for communication skills and it includes both the spoken and the written form. 
Gluck!</p>
