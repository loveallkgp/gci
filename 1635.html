<p>Hi Guys,
I am 26 years old and in long distance relationship with a guy for almost 2 years. The problem is that my parents pressurized me to get engaged to a girl. They emotionally blackmailed me and got me engaged to a gal. I am gay and never been with a girl my entire life. My mom is a heart patient and I fear that if I come out to her she won't be able to survive this. Moreover, my in-laws are quite religious and they won't call off the engagement. I don't want to hurt my parents and dishonor the girl but I do want to end this engagement. I don't see an easy way out of this. I do want to grow old with this guy. We love each other. 
I can't even imagine what my parents have to go through to end this. And what possible explanation could they give. I am golden boy to my most near and dear ones. And don't know what to do.
One of my friend's suggested that I should get married and as it gets better as the time pass. But I don't think so. And say, if I do that then what would I tell my BF? At the moment, I haven't told him anything about my engagement. 
I would appreciate your advice and support.
Thanks.
Regards,
D.S</p>
<h1>Viv- I am shocked beyond means to read this. You are being forced into all of this because your mom is a heart patient. I'm so sorry about your condition. For the first time in my life I am seeing no solution here. But the honest thing here to do would be to come with some external help. If you could contact an NGO, they can guide you better. Just for the sake of happiness of your parents and your family you cannot destroy the life of the girl. BTW, does your bf feels the same for you? If he does, then it may be the time for you both to take a step for yourself and face the inevitable. One day or the other, the truth will come out. So let it come out when the condition is not yet damaged. Stay strong buddy.</h1>
