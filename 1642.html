<p>Hiii guys ....</p>
<p>I have realised that love can't be forced over anyone . I had always been lonely in my life . I never got any body's love expect my mom and dad's and my Dadi's . And I never had friends too .... hence I used to search love on net ... I was dating a guy . And I was the person who forced him to love me . I finally broke up with him . Not just broke up . I mean we have become friends now . I was imposing my love and implementing my love over him . It was my fault ..... I know I would have hurt him but love can't be forced over anyone . I might never get a better guy than him . But I have to confess this fact that I forced him to love me . By becoming friends with him I feel so relifed ..... now m single and now m waiting for love to originally happen instead of forcing my love to come out for someone .... </p>
