<p>Suddenly now a new problem comes up. I was studying for priesthood from the year 2004-2007. In 2007, due to my homosexual leanings ( long story about how they came to know) I was asked to take a break. I was asked to take psychotherapy sessions and join back. I came back and told my parents the reason. They were supportive. I had a steady boyfriend soon after ( lasted about 3 years until he married) and my parents knew I was in love with him and I was sleeping with him! </p>
<p>I had vehemently refused to get married when I turned 21 and considered the chapter closed. </p>
<p>This year I was diagnosed early stage of a terminal disease. Doctors haven't been able to decide if I will live beyond 10-15 years. My parents however feel that it is the work of some 'evil spirit' and it will just disappear some day! I am sick and tired of explaining it to them that they need to accept that I'm diagnosed with something that can't be cured! I reiterated that I would not get married!</p>
<p>Suddenly yesterday my sisters friends relatives proposed for my marriage to their daughter. Since I live away from my family, my father reluctantly told me about it and when I refused he was sad but accepted and passed the phone to my mom. I started off in an angry tone asking my mom why they started off with the topic of marriage again and if tehyve forgotten that the disease is a problem enough for me. Also, I'm not the right guy for a relationship since I feel suffocated in a societal foundation!</p>
<p>Then cake the emotional blackmail about the 'vansh'. I said I won't and that's final and that I have many ways to get a kid to the family. My mom says, tell the girl u will have ur own life outside. Get married and give love of father and mother to your kid! </p>
<p>Questions.
1. How do I come out again, when I had done so about 8 years ago?
2. How do I convince my parents that I'm perfectly capable of being a single father?
3. How can I get it out of their system that my sister can be the one who takes the family forward? (They're sufficiently educated BTW. These serials I tell you, they've corrupted a lot)
4. Will it be right to get married? ( I'm bisexual with a greater tendendency to sleep with guys)</p>
<h1>GCI- I'd say, tell those things once a again to your parents. This time a bit strictly. Take your stand and do not listen to them. You don't have to bow down to the social pressure, emotional drama and sad sad tears that they can take out in the name of vansh. Sometimes you have to strict with some people whom you love if they do not understand. Tell them to keep their words to yourself, if they do not understand.</h1>
<p>BTW, that's my way to deal with a situation like this. You may get other ideas too from other people, but considering your family environment, choose the best method. Say everything you want, do anything you want without regret. </p>
<p>I wish you all the best and happy times. Do update me about your situation please.</p>
