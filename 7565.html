<p>I have been in a relationship for last 10 months. He is a real nice guy like you see in romantic movies. Once when I was in hospital he used to come daily and sometimes stay overnight telling jokes and taking care of me. My family used to tease me calling him not my friend but my wife. However thing is I found another guy online who I have an affair with and he's fairer than my current bf. He also proposed to me. My bf is dark but still I accepted him. But I don't think I can spend whole life with such a guy.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Can't u make ur current bf fairer by any means??? I don't want to sound preachy but try to tell ur current guy that his colour tone should be more polished without sounding a douche.</h1>
<p>As for u....try to get a lobotomy in the head.</p>
