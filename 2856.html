<p>I have a problem for which i'm searching for a solution. I'm 21 now but still have bet- wetting problem. It doesn't happen every night. It usually occurs when the weather is very cold or when I'm in a stressful situation, like having an exam next day. I have a very deep sleep and never feel anything at all during the night. My parents took me to doctors for treatment from my childhood. They would give some medicines and would seem to go away but it will return always. 
Till now, when my friends call me for sleep overs, i would make up some excuse and not go. I met a guy on FB about a month ago, we chatted, shared pics and we found a lot of common ground. I spent a few hours at his house today and he proposed to me. I accepted.  Now he wants me to spend a night with him. I'm scared. What do I do? I'm very embarrassed. Should I tell him the truth? Is there any lasting solution? </p>
<h1>GCI : see don't sleep in ac or anything cold . just before you sleep don't drink water , atleast keep one hour gap .before you go to bed go to toilet and pee , then sleep . never drink coke , pepsi or cold drinks or milk in evening time or night before sleep . avoid these liquids .</h1>
<h1>psychological issues : see i am not psychologist but i had the same case as kid . do you have any fear ?? is anybody at college , in friends , or at home dominates you , beats you or anyone you fear a lot . ?? you mentioned stress of exams ... so is their any peer pressure on you to get good marks ???</h1>
<p>see my parents took me to doctor when i was in class 5th but i was still wetting my beds . reason doctor said was i was having fear issues .my parents talked to me after that ..they changed so many things in my life , increased my  safety , and weren't strict to me . </p>
<p>just after month  , the number of times i wet my bed decreased  .after a year i completely stopped and this thing never came back . 
you are 21 .. if there is some pressure on you .. release it . don't let anything burden you . do what you enjoy and give away stress .</p>
