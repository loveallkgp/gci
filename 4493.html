<p>Hi people,
Last night I was thinking a lot about my future. I have a bf and we have been together for 10 years. We met in 2003 and since 2004 are living together. My bf is from north India, typical Punjabi family. His family is putting a lot of pressure on him for getting married. I know for sure that my bf won't hurt me at any cost but still I have some fear. One of our mutual Punjabi friend recently got married. He was gay but his family somehow managed to get him married. My bf has promised me that he won't get married. I trust him but I don't trust his family. I met his family once and they are very persuasive.
I am bengali and we have created our own little world here in Kolkata. I am out to my parents. They have met my bf. My parents are very supportive. They helped us to find a flat. But no support is available on his parents' side. On top of that, his cousins are homophobic. Please guys advise me so that I can help my bf to be with me.
Regards,
Abhishek</p>
<h1>GCI- That totally depends upon your boyfriend that how he takes the family pressure. If he wants to come out or not that should be decided by him. But if he does, he should be helped by you and your parents. Good luck.</h1>
