<p>As we run towards our destiny,sometimes it happens that the paths become more intersting than the destiny itself or perhaps some people makes it intersting.
I am by nature very ambitious.I dont know why I created a fake account it was just an instinct.But to my surprise they are so many living my life. and I started loving this place very much.
Why do I love this place so much? Is it that acceptance that I didnt get in my real life?Is it the strength you get when you know that I am not alone.
Actually the answer had been apparent.It was infront of my eyes.It filled my inbox.I just didnt see.
I met someone here few days back.This very page brought us together.A boy,a stranger a friend a companion.He is very much like me.We unknowingly say the same things.He suddenly starts singing the song I am listening to.He cares for me.He laughs at my dumbness.Nights will not become good nights without his gn8.
My love for this place is actually love for this guy.So people close your eyes for a second and look for that special someone.who knows even you may get a friend like me.
This new friend has changed my whole world into a celebration.and before its too late I have to reenergise myself and pull myself back into the race for my goal.
All these things happened spontaneously the creation of this account following this page and winning a frnd.This whole episode left millions of memories in me.
I will be missing you and all these days once I get into the work.
NEW MAN IN THE CITY kk.</p>
