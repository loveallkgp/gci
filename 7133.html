<p>I was enjoying the breakfast with my boyfriend and his mom on the 24th morning, when she suddenly asked me if my family was conservative. To which I replied, they are but the love they have for me is much more than the fear of the society. I haven't came out yet, but will do it soon. </p>
<p>And then she went on-</p>
<p>Her- I knew it about my son. He was 16 when he came out and I immediately accepted him. He is too much important for me. His grandma is old ad conservative, so when I told her, I thought she wouldn't accept him. If she had come for him, I would have gone for her. If she cannot accept my child, I am sorry but I cannot have you as a mother. I love my son. </p>
<p>That's when I held his hand and saw tears in his eyes. </p>
<p>It was the best Christmas day of his life.</p>
