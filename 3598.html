<p>Hello #GCI! 
I was in a relationship a month back to be precise...He's 24 and I'm 20...Prior to this I had had no experience in dating an elder guy...So, we were going smooth; but there was his group, and we fought over it time after time...Then he started complaining about my looks: my hair, my eyes, my lips, my nose, and even my spects...He complained that I was verily immature...I was in a trance then, and hence, I tried to change myself as per his norms...I tried a lot...All my friends complained that I had changed; and for him, I was an immature git...Then came a time when he never called or messaged; I had to do it first everytime...He lives in Kolkata by the way...And I used to pester him with my questions everytime about him not calling me and all...His replies usually told of business...And one fine day, he had asserted that he didn't like me anymore...He seeked for break up...Initially, I cried, cried a lot, refusing to break up...But one day, I heard the frustration in his voice, and I decided to break up...
Till date, I have not moved on...I have his cards and gifts...He once tied a sacred thread on my wrist...Even though yellow has turned red, staying with another sacred thread, it's still there...He's the one who's been ever present in my mind...You're possibly reading this, and I won't ask you to come back, but I dunno what to say...Be happy...:)</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, burn those gifts and cards down. Remove that thread, throw it on the ground and dance on it with shoes on. You show that person what he is.</h1>
