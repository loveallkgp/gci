<p>Hi... Need a suggestion.. I am gay and have been attracted to boys since childhood. But I am a very shy and reserved guy. I first lived away from my home for my MBA. The guy who was my roommate became best friend of mine and I started liking him a lot. He is straight. He used to hold my hand sometimes and hug me ocassionaly. I liked it a lot. And my like turned into love. But one day, when I was out he saw gay video collection in my laptop, thus getting an idea of me being gay(he doesn't know that I got to know this) and his behaviour changed. Even if I touched his hand he would ask me to remove it. He never hugged me after that day. But there was no change in his friendship or care for me otherwise. Slowly time passed and studies ended and we got posted in 2 different cities. I used to miss him a lot. Now after 1 year, coincidentally I got transferred to his city again and we became roommates again. I am very happy about it that I have my best friend with me but I can't stop thinking about him and it gets a bit difficult to control my feelings. But I fear that, if I tell him about me being gay and loving him, I might loose him even as a friend. What should I do???</p>
<h1>GCIL- HOLD YOUR DICK AND YOUR FEELINGS.</h1>
<p>Sirf raita faelega dono ka....aur kuch nahi...</p>
<p>P.S- U want to do what with him? If want to sustain friendship then divert ur hormones and ur feelings for some other guy who must be gay or bi atleast. Duhh</p>
