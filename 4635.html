<p>I'm in shock. My childhood friend proposed me yesterday. We both have been friend for 13 years and passed out from same school. But he decided to move to Australia for further studies. Yesterday after 2 years we met and I was very excited. He asked my mother whether I could night stay. My mother nodded and she smiled as if she knew everything. We talked till 3 am and than decided to sleep. I was feeling awkward to sleep next to your childhood crush. It was too cold and he decided to join the blanket. It was already to cold and I was feeling sleepy. So I slept off. After an hour or so he was holding my waist and than started to cuddle me. I was feeling shy although I liked it. But I pushed it away. He than hold my hand and said whether I loved him or not. I was shocked. He smiled and said that he knew everything that I loved him the most. I was shy and said no and was embarrassed like anything. He was pushed me to my limits and I could but control and I cried and said yes. I thought he would hit me. But he hugged me said he loved me the most. I was awestruck. Internally I was smiling but I was shock. Without any further conversation we slept and he hold me tight. Today morning when I woke up he smiled and try to bring out the topic I changed it. We spent today together. He tried many time to bring up the topic. But I was avoiding it. Now he messaged me why was I upset but truth be told I'm shocked and don't know how to react. Please tell me what should I say. He wants to meet me tomorrow but I'm getting jitters to meet him. :( I want to meet him tomorrow but what should I tell him. :(</p>
