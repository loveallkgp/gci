<p>Sometimes its painful but we have to let go of old things for new things. I was in relationship with a guy, we were live in partners and he is the best boyfriend one cn get, I was preparing fr CAT n despite spending whole day at office at night he use to help me in solving questions, even wake up for me till midnight while he has to go ofc early. I gt selected n left fr top b clg in bnglr leaving him in delhi, he was happy for me n emotional too , bt i was so concentrated on my goal that i thot he will distract me n  i wanted to leave my gay life n want to live new lyf , i said  we were just friend n m sry if i ever make u feel like i lv u. It hurted me bt i hv to. inspite of all this he came to drop me at station . Now i m here , i vll hv gud career bt i even dun know why m missing him badly, it has been months bt i cry fr him daily. I want to call him n say sorry bt m afraid he might hv move on and there is no future of gays in india. bt if he is single atleast .....  :( .. bcz whn i ask we cn be in contact as a frnd thn he said it vll be complicated M u wont understand . dont do it.. He use to call me with M (my name first letter) i knw u use to read confessions here , if ur habit is still same n u r also here lyk me , plz text me warna me to kr hi dunga kuch din baad :D i lv u</p>

<p>U need to understand 2 things-
1- Love was there, is still between both of you and will be even if u leave it hanging in mid air like this.
2- U need to concentrate on ur life ur career and ur professional goals, but do remember he played a very big part in achieving what u have today.</p>
<p>P.S- Its hurt and not hurted to correct you and do not forget that u cannot choose to love like this. Either be completely detached or love him passionately; from being even at a distance from him and yes also do keepin mind people like him are hard to come by make sure u don't end up being the predator of his life.</p>
<p>P.S- Future will be there if only u put ur ass into that valiant effort instead of just getting pumped up with someone's willy.</p>
