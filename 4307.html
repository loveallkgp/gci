<p>I am a proud gay but i also feel same sex attraction is a mental disease. Its from deep analysis of volumes of scientific data i have read. Please read this with an open mind. Every emotion in nature like anger jealously etc has a purpose in evolution but same sex attr doesnt benefit human race at all. Also nature hasnt made the ass muscles and walls as flexible as vagina causing fatal injuries. Also ass is not sterile like vagina. This means nature doesnt support anal sex. Nature also doesnt oral sex else semen would have tasted good. Its taste is more to repel. So physically and physiologically its not supported. It has to be all in our heads. I think if we accept ourselves as having mental disease then there will more funding for research and cure. It will make the lives of millions of lgbt happier once they turn straight through a cure. So instead of fighting for rights by siding with the gay lobby, we must fight for global govt funding for cure.</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh honey, you are not gay. You are a homophobic bigot who is using words like this to spread false information. Being gay is not in our heads. It is not a disease. If sexuality was in head, what are your views about heterosexuality? Lets apply your curing thinking to straights as well. Your confession is just a sorry excuse to believe in something that is totally wrong. We don't need your thinking in our lives. We are happy the way we are. Some people really like it up their ass. Some people really like the taste of man juice. Some people really like spending their lives with the love of their lives and none of your government funding for curing a disease reasons will ever change their minds. Over here and on this planet people like you are sick. So better cure yourself because on this side change is not possible.</h1>
