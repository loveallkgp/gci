<p>Admin GCI i knw u give awesome suggestns and plz i hope u give a real n practical suggestion which i can apply.. I loved a guy frm 6 months it was from my side nt his. I knw it is foolishness and better to move bt i cant. Than i met a guy who said he is moving abroad and told me just to be friends nthng much more than that. We hangout he hugged me many times and kissd me also bt just as a frnd. And he knws about that guy and he always says leave him. Nw a guy loves me like hell and i knw what the pain is so i cant even cheat him. Am just dam fuckd up between this. The guy i love dnt give a fuck about me,the guy who kissd me and helpd me frm depressn leavng india, the guy who loves me he is my bestfrnd i cant hurt him. I desperately need ur suggestn help me out. :'( :'(</p>
<h1>GCI- Damn! What you need is a break from all the emotional turmoil!</h1>
<p>Talking about the guy whom you love- LEAVE HIM! And stop thinking about him</p>
<p>Talking about the guy who is moving abroad- He himself made it clear that he can't be more than a friend so there is no reason to sweat on it more. Be his friend only. </p>
<p>Talking about the guy who finally loves you- Date him and try to workout the thing you have between the two of you. You may have a successful relationship. But if you are not over the first guy, I'd suggest to explain everything to him and let him help you out. </p>
<p>Always go for the person who loves you back. He will keep you happy.</p>
