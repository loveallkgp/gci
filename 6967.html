<p>Hello
Umm...I am 18 and I have this fear that I'll never get anyone, any person who would want to be In a relationship with me. I know it's too early to assume this, I've just stepped out of the phase of adolescence but I am hopeless, I don't know why but this fear drives me crazy sometimes, I just cannot convince myself to stop being a nincompoop. Whenever I come across the accounts of gay fellows who are in their 30s and 40s and haven't been able to find anyone, living a lonely life...that scares me.
I know this is so stupid, you might not even find my confession worth posting on your page but that's how I feel and this makes me cry sometimes.</p>
<p>I am sorry. </p>
<h1>GCI- People are lonely because sometimes they don't know the approach to a successful relationship. You are just 18 and yes it is kinda hard to find the right guy, but you don't have to loose all the hope right now. Have some hope left for future use. Anyway, don't let your happiness dependent upon anyone else. You don't wanna be all doey eyed, kitten who could fall in love with the first person that they would meet. Take your time in falling in love.</h1>
