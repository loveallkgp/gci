<p>I am in my late forties married with a son about to graduate next year.I felt an platonic attraction towards same sex at an early age and could not understand what it was.I felt something lacking in my life and took the step of exploring my self through same sex partners. Living in a metropolitan city I had many options.I understood a lot more of my feelings through these one night stands. What's more important is I understood what emotional empathy means at a deeper level. I made some friends on FB and one of them suggested I go through this page which serves as a no holds barred platform for gays. I thank this friend for having gifted me with this beautiful platform where I too am sharing my feelings. Having said this I am happier as an individual than I ever was not because I had sex but I understand the view point of same sex people in a better light. I do believe there are some highly creative as well as well educated individuals associated with this page.I would say learning never ends and I continue with SELF exploration to understand LOVE in all its facets and dimensions ,your page being one of the medium for same. I also wish each one who is connected with this page in some way or the other good health joy lots of love and Happy Diwali.</p>
