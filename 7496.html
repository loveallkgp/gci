<p>When I was small my mama use to come to our house often. He used to kiss me a lot and make me sit on his lap while feeding. He used to put his hands under my armpits and stomach while tickling me. I was very innocent and allowed it. My mother also used to ignore all this even after seeing. Now when I talked to some friends they told me this is child abuse and it might have turned me gay. They all also turned gay after abuse by a gay. It all makes sense. I don't have a gay personality. I just attracted to men. This pervert turned me gay. Recently I met him at a function. He is quite old now with family. I was drunk and insulted him a lot for the abuse and told him I will get him arrested. I even spit in his drink. He pretended to act surprised and all but such perverts can hide very well. It felt very good to confront the person who destroyed my life. Who knows it might turn me straight again as I have found the root cause of my gayness.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Lick some pussies love, there is always a cure for 'gayness'. And yes don't tell us how it was, we would be busy elsewhere.</h1>
