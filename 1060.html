<p>Hi , iam from noida , u.p. .i m in love with this manager from my company. He is only 1-2 year5 older 2 me( M 26) . I was madly had a crush in this guy as he has the physique and attitude that i like. And frnkly if i ever get connected to him i will b the most happiest person on earth..well the confession is that i had a very huge crush on him and even tried to check his history , and found out that he is single, doesnt goes to f.b anymore and i havnt seen him talkin over the phone with a girl or u know in breaks ever.. Mera us din thoda dil toot gaya jab t.v series ki baat ho rahi thi. He said he likes game of thrones and spartacus alot. When i first saw those series i felt its just woman f.@@g and blood . My heart was broken and a thought came to ma mind that he is into girls porno and stuff. I ignored him for next 2-3days but bhagwaan bhi mazze leta hai mujhse, mujhe kuch kaam pada and i had to go to him and talk about it. Guys i dont fanatasise having sex vid him but rather cuddling and a nyc hug from him. Later on i did some research and find out that these t.v series are also g@y oriented , vid gay scenes and even lesbian scenes . Chance to bahut kam hain but i pray thats what he should be liking . If thats the case then i want him to b my best friend and a lover till i grow old n die . But if thats not the case then i think isnt he sexually deprived?? Cos porn hi dekhni hai to excuse kyun dena. . Well he is quite manly, and avg lukin l not a greek god but yes little on heavier side. Mann karta hai uske liye gud feelings chor du. Kynkk baad me mera ni dil tootega and leave the cmpny...... I like hin like everything :</p>
<h1>Viv- Yeah those serials have a bit of gay stuff but that doesn't mean he is gay. A theme and storyline is also associated with those serials if you look at it. Now, please do not play with your profession. Your manager is definitely a straight guy and you will be jeopardizing your professional life for your inner feelings. Life isn't a Walt Disney fairy tale. Its time you accept the reality and get practical.</h1>
