<p>hii all iam sam 24years of age i live in noida iam quite gud looking guy i live in pg today today there was a new rommate came and as i have a very command over english . he came and the first thing he said about me that i am kaint and he told that i shuld try modeling.  HE seems to be a down market guy thought he hot he has body shody i think he will fuck me one day but at the same time he is loquacious which i found to to be lame. i wish i could capitulate myself to him only when he agree. but his command over any language is calamity.  and the  worst cardinal part  of his is the way he speaks but he is hot. 
BUT I AM FRIENDLY AS A HUMAN BEING . I HELP PEOPLE PEOPLE BUT IN RETURN THEY  MAKE ME CRY I AM VERY SENSITIVE I THINK THIS TYM I SHOULD BE MORE RESERVED  AND SEDUCTIVE ...</p>
<h1>GCI- Nee marjaaneya tu hi kaint reh gya iss dharti te....saanu te kadon de kidey pe gye ...hai na!?</h1>
<p>Honey your twee little story is rebarbative and somewhat insipid and flaunts sanctimoniousness, but on the other hand it is quite sweet of you to be honest with your carnal desires for him.
U r friendly but don't let people trample u...U should be honest in your attempts to be friends with him..who knows he may ask for a sexual favour if u turn out to be the guy next door to fuck..
TILL THEN HAPPY IMAGINING!!!</p>
