<p>confessor no.1463 </p>
<p>i just asked bbm pins coz if talk to many people then i could forget about him .. staying alone its not easy to move on as u never been in this situation u will never understand it admin mate! try to respect others feeling and try to understand what and why someone is saying things. try to understand what could the reason behind it. if u cant understand then just dont speak .. ur single word can make someone feel sad evenmore. i am already in full of sadness and after your taunts i think i shouldn't make any gay friends anymore coz they wont understands like u did :') . tc but next time think the reason behind the words before leaving ur taunts . now dont say those weren't taunts. and sorry i dont need any friends or bbm.pins. </p>
<p>$abby : see we aren't gods here . we are humans at the time from when words are sent to us in written form we can't ' see emotions , we can't see situations , and we can't understand your whole life ' . that small  paragraph shows us personality of a person . 
believe me sometimes it kills us to read what people are writing . and sometimes we say things in a naughty way or maybe taunting way to make you realise that the problem isn't the poroblem but your action or your behaviour towards it is real ' problem ' . </p>
<p>suggestiona can be given to a problem ..but when their is not a problem we can just make a funny comment . what else you expect . 
anyhow we don't have personal issues with anybody here . but learn to tackle problems . sadness is myth ... a person who has will to stay happy will keep himself happy no matter what . 
anyhow  i haven't read your confession yet .</p>
