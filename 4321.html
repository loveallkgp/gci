<p>I got my Mr. Right in my office... It was love at first sight for me... I proposed him and he liked the way I expressed my feelings... He neither said yes nor No.. I too wasn't expecting a commitment so soon... It's just a month since we know each other... Till now we met only twice and there was no sexual advancement, which is something that I liked about these meetings... Both of us are busy and don't get much time to even talk to each other.. Still, whatever little time we get, is enough for flirting and teasing and so many exciting things..</p>
<p>I am extremely hopeful about him.. I have stopped all hunting on facebook after I met him and I have decided to be with him forever if he agrees to a relationship..</p>
<p>Now, my worries are as follows :
1. Due to my past experiences, I at times feel insecure if he doesn't take up my calls although I know that he is not lying to me..
2. What if he says No after a long time.. I mean after it is too late for me to be away from him?
3. My Mom is hinting me to get married to a girl. I don't want that.. How should I convince her? My Dad is convinced. I am out to both of them long back.
4. He is not out to anybody at home. I know he is strong and will do it one day.. But, when? This 'when' keeps me worried in vain..</p>
<p>I am just hoping for the Best, but please help me. I don't want these tensions to ruin my flourishing relationship..</p>
<h1>GCI- It might look good in the beginning but you know there is a time when you have to get real and start with the future. I know one month is still a small duration but you cannot be in honeymoon period forever. You both are mature enough and you both know what you want. Even if he is unclear on the outside, he knows it from the inside.</h1>
<p>Don't give up on your decision. You have to convince your mom anyways. There is no option b. Just tell her that you cannot ruin a girl's life and if by any chance you get married to a girl, you will never be happy for the entire lifetime. </p>
<p>At the end, do not expect your guy to come out when you want. It has to be his decision according to his own comfort level. You can be there to help him in this but don't force it upon him.</p>
