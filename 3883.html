<p>i always knew i was gay. yes, it took me considerable time accepting it to my own self but eventually i accepted it. I was not proud of myself as so but i was okay with whatever i was....who ever i was and i never considered myself less than anyone. 
Being in an orthodox Indian Muslim family, i used to considered myself as cursed... which led to numerous prayers to Allah for fixing me. But they were never answered. My faith on my religion never lessened tho'. i m still the same  amount of muslim as i was back then. just the thing is i now have cut my romantic n sexual life from my religion...i now will live my life as a muslim but wont compromise my romantic life. i will live my life sharing it with another man. wont marry. and rahi baat gunah ki...then i do lots of sin eaxh day...ek aur sahi. marne ke baad dekh lenge...saath mein dojakh mein bhi jall lenge :D at least waha par bhi woh hoga mere saath. but iss life mein if he has created this way then m gonna live this way...marriage n all ke jhanjhat me pad kar life miserable banana is never an option for me.</p>
