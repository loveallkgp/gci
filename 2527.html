<p>today i was watching lok sabha proceedings, many members of parliament were behaving in such a vulgar way, that speaker had to adjourn house in every 10 minutes, if members of lok sabha who are important lawmakers of our country , behave in such a vulgar way , are narrow minded with shitty thoughts than we couldn't expect people like shobit pandey to act wisely, he is just an illetrate, who dont even know the basic sciece responsible for shaping of someone's behaviour..i guess he slept during social science classes when teacher asked their students never to indulge in discrimination, it's better to avoid people like him and forget them, if possible, they will realise someday how stupid and narrow minded he was!</p>
<h1>GCI : recently lots of ministers have behaved shamelessly and uttered words which you can only hear in cheap streets . somebody recently from bjp has beaten a women and she was hospitalised reason he gave he couldn't stand her talking ill of his party . again i read the news where a female doctor in bihar in day light was beaten by leaders .. and they even tried to rape her .when she went to police even police harassed her . most of the criminals are given place our parliament .what can we do !!! ??</h1>
