<p>hey admins.. guys u r doing great job. hugs to both of u ... so here is my confession not a confession but whatever.. so I m19 gay.. in China studying MBBS . here in China there are gays but I really don't like Chinese guys I don't find them attractive and also they don't speak English its a big problem. I have used blued app which is very famous in China. but I didn't find any Indian .or South Asian. I want some gay friends ..with them .. I can be my self ..I feel very lonely here .most of my friends have gf . they just enjoy so much ...I really want an Indian (or south Asian ) gay friend here. I hope through this page if I can find one ... also there are lots of Pakistani Bangladeshi &amp; Nepali students here . I m little introvert.. and shy . and also I am suffering from baldness. I m just 19 it's so unfair. and I don't know how.. there are little wrinkles &amp;  lots of acne scars on my face . no one actually believes that I am 19 .I look like 30-32. I feel so disgusting when I  look into mirror. i just can't face my reflection I hate my pics . i have lost my self confidence .. I don't think anyone will ever love me ...</p>
<h1>GCI- So u have love problem, bald problem, communication problem, racial preference problem, country problem, app problem and skin problems and u want solutions all at once...just like Harry drove that magical car of the Weasely family in The Chamber of secrets?!</h1>
<p>What do u think we are Dumbledore or Nicolas Flamel?</p>
