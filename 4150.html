<p>19 male tdy I wana. confess some thing it can be said as iam opening up myself......to start I wana say that I truely love a straight boy, who was just my friend 2 yrs ago it begins with frndship we chatd every day every night bt suddnly as time changes his sms slow down to the point tht he strtd ignrng me .... he strd publicly abusing me mentally abusing me physciall abusing me he treats me like iam nt an human being and bt I cnt do any thng to him becz I loved him frm my deep heart so I go on and tookd his negativity upon me becz I cnt hurt him
I was broken frm my heart I had been treated like a shit. . bt he nevr cared I took care of him whn he got in to an accident bt he forgot it... and at the end I hv no energyvleft to struggle to make him understnd my love bt I truely loved him tdy he evn didn't cnsidered me as a frnd any more</p>
<h1>GCI- Did you know that it was never gonna happen? If you could have understood it, you might never have allowed him to treat you like shit. Where was your effing self respect? You cannot force someone's sympathy on you. The more you cry for it, more ridicule will you get.</h1>
