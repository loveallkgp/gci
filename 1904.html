<p>Hiii  friends ... </p>
<p>It's not a confession ..but it's just a regret which I have I need to share I out .... </p>
<p>I m single and I m 19 years old ... I hurt and m broken ... people say That m too demanding &amp; few say that , I m rude , mean &amp; few say that I have an attitude ... but very few know this fact That I have non to share my  feelings with ...  I belong to such a well to do with family and whenever I see my sisters moving out with fucking hot hunks I too feel like being with a hunk in my life .... I m a good looking guy .. it's not that I don't get proposals . After liking this page I have started rejecting clusters of proposals in a day ... but I just couldn't feel it right .... as they weren't That of my level or status  .... I m confused ... will I lead a better life being a sex seeker or by being a love seeker I would have a better life ... I keep knocking at people's doors for true love ..... but no body knows how loyal I can i be for the one I ll fall for .... I m really dumb where far sex is concern I m 19 years old but still I m a virgin ... and I wanna break my virginity only with my bf  ..... what is wrong with me ... why m I screwed up in my own thoughts I just 
don't understand ..... </p>
<h1>GCI : oh god you are just 19 . just chill ... i don't know when guys enter this 17, 18 or 19 age why they become so keen to get their 'seal' broken .</h1>
<p>and  darling ' high expectation lead to dissappointment ' is a popular quotes . either wait or drop some level .</p>
