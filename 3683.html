<p>Hey guys... Its not a confession rather a need for suggestion... 
So the problem is that.. All of  us wanna fall in love bcoz its the best  feeling in  the world to love  someone and be loved back by him...  But is it really worth the pain... Those phone calls not being returned bcoz ur lover is busy somewhere n he doesn't hv tym to reply... U hv sent so many texts on whatsapp but he is not replying to those as well.. U wanna just know if everything is alright... May be u just wanna hear his voice bcoz sometimes nothing seems important than his reply and u mourn for hours over these... He says that he loves u..... regularly... He  says that he  wants to spend the whole life with you... Always... He says that if it is going to be anybody else in his life then its u... But still things which u consider important fr u... He doesn't appreciate those much... U wait for hours so that he will call u or atleast text u after coming back from office but he is too sleepy to do that also...<br>
I have always refrained myself from love but sometimes its just gotta happen... U cant control ur foolish heart... 
What to do guys??
Living for  a moment without him seems like impossible :(</p>
