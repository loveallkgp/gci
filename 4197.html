<p>i have always been rejected in my life...
i m not ugly.. not ill mannered... i hv lot of friends.. but what i crave for , is not in my life</p>
<p>it all started when i was 17 . i made an id on pr , met a bottom named MANISH knowing that i m bottom too , fell in love , then i was used financially and when my money exhausted.. i was rejected.. . and its totally okay.. after that i realized i was wrong.</p>
<p>1 yr later i fell in love with SAURABH MAKKAD he again rejected</p>
<p>then 3 mnths later i was offered frndship by a guy in cs brach of my clg.. i became serious due to which i was rejected ..</p>
<p>next i met LALIT he in fashion designing.. he rejected as he is very hndsm and i m not hndsm ..
then 2 more but they were also not serious</p>
<p>after that i decided to delete my fb id and whatsapp too but i got a msg frm sm1 who is today my best frnd FAIZAN he started with a normal conversation but he told that he is muslim and can not be in a couple with me</p>
<p>after that i came in final yr and despite being topper and most confident i was rejected in TCS &amp; WIPRO</p>
<p>still i get msgs frm people to be in relationship but what to do.. as i knw.. no one can me serious</p>
<h1>GCI- Damn! Don't feel bad for it. Feel good that you are not with those people who cannot make you feel good. You always want those people with you who are a positive strength. Not the negative ones.</h1>
