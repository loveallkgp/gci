<p>M 22....</p>
<p>I have been at this id for about 2 year..
People fall in love seeing my pics. And i feel as if someday a good soul
would come and understand me...
I lived in delhi n nw bcoz of my job left tht too. I met this guy on fb long back.
That tym v were only acquintances. But due to sm blunders... a guy
who proposed him whom he was seeing for long tym proved to be a cheater.
I had a crush on him... (showed sm wrng pics).
so wen he got my no. to clear misunderstanding v talked long.
Now I dunno wat is to be done...!!
Actly, i gave him my no. pretty late.
But wen i saw his pic he was kinda chubby/little fat...not that i care being fat or wat.
But you knw wat you dream... ? it was totally opposite.
When i hear his voice i fall for him... and he has alrdy fallen for me.
He has a pure soul and... i feel him to be suitable.
But wat abt my thots...? abt all i dream?
I mean... i feel... it will take tym for me to accept him.
But due to im being emmo fool i have said i dunno hw mny things as a lover to him.
I sumtym feel surprised as i have fallen for him... other tyms its a case of
forceful acceptance in virtue of feelings only.
I have no idea wats gonna happen... ?
I had been alone for long tym... may be thts y i said so to him.
May be i wont b able to love him... ?But yes ! I want to love him
d way nobody ever. But i dnt knw y m hating... this part tht..he is lyk tht way.</p>
<p>Im really dilemmatic now...whether to proceed or not.
Even im scared if i wont b able to like him...to tht extent.
For the record v have not met yet.... its a case of week only nw.</p>
<p>Ps- I need serious advice. Dnt end up in ur so called one liners.....i beg u.</p>
<h1>GCI- According to me you can either love someone or you cannot. You cannot just hang on there by the thread wanting to make a decision to fall on either side. If you do want to take things forward with him then do it without any judgments. If you have a sheerest of doubt, then do not even think about raising his expectations. That will be cruel on your part. Make up your mind after a wise thinking.</h1>
