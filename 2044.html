<h1>GCI- Oh GAWD! Another gay in denial. I will take my pants down and dance to Justin Beiber songs in Nicki Minaj style if he isn't gay or atleast bisexual.</h1>
<p>BTW, I really don't know what to say here. If you say it again, the condition might end up in a fight or him starting to ignore you. If you don't say your feelings, you are gonna get depressed because of sadness. If you stay as friend, you are still gonna feel the same for him. The last resort is that you both should talk it out. Fuck the awkwardness and talk everything out so that either you should end up together or you could move on.</p>
