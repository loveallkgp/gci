<p>Hi.. i am gay .. 24.. from Delhi.
Dear Admin &amp; friends ..
in this gay world .. is real love possible? ?? 
all need just hot body,sexy butt,beautiful face,good sex.
my one friend committed suicide last year.. he loved a gay guy so much. but his bf cheated him. 
now I am afraid that my bf ..though we r not committed as partner..but I love him like a mad.. I cant live without him. . I can do anything for him. but I realize that he does not love me like I do. he interact with another guy.. date with them. J have no objection about his interest.  but at the end I want him as a lover.. as a partner..  I dont know what is our future relationship.  but friends I feel that I will die if he forget me.. I really love him.
plz give some suggestions .</p>
<h1>GCI- Love is hard to find but it is real. Now lets get it straight. You have a problem with his affection that it is not as intense as your. Yet you wrote that you have no objection with him dating other guys. Why there are two sides of your nature? Either be completely comfortable and don't complain at all, or just don't deal with it on the whole. Don't swim in the middle with a half heart. Talk to him about it. If it makes him uncomfortable then you know what to do. Better get separated than having problems.</h1>
