<h1>GCI- Tell me the purpose of the education that we have? Besides earning money. People say "have some better education so you can have a nice future, a free future where you will remain happy." Let me tell you one thing, no one becomes educated to remain enslaved to the ideas of others. The whole point of getting a higher education is to take decisions that benefit you and your free thinking! Tell me one difference between an illiterate man enslaved to the masters and a literate man enslaved to the ideas of others. Can you?</h1>
