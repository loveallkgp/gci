<h1>GCI- I don't know what to say in this. It is a really sad situation. The thing that mainly bothered me was that there was no valid reason for a break up. I'm really sorry that you had to go through this. If he really loved you then he never would have left. And when people in a relationship say, "You deserve someone way better than me. I can't be with you." Guys, that not selflessness. That is stupidity. Try to cherish what you have rather than giving up on it on assumptions. As for you confessor, if you really want to get happy now, you should remove his contacts, throw away all of his gifts and get out of his feelings. It can take a year for you to come out of it but you have to try it.</h1>
