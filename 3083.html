<p>This is my second confession here... i m 25 years old guy.. working in Delhi. A month back, i met a guy of my age on PR and we met in a mall... this was a sexdate though... we came back to my place and had a bang-bang session...later on that day i realised.. i liked him way too much... i told this to him knowing that he had been in a relationship for 3 years and they didnt broke up but just splitted up and this guy still had feelings for his ex. He agreed to be friends with me and nothing more to which i agreed.. we have been meeting very frequently.... since then.... i have feelings for him which he knows about and he says that he likes me as well and i m special to him.... the twist is.... it is me who spends money everytime we meet up... i pay for all his shopping.. clothes...grocery...recharges.. etc.... he has agreed that he would pay me back all that money in installments.... but i still dont understand whether he is with me because of getting free of interest credit or does he genuinely likes me... </p>
<h1>GCI- Huh? I can see the reason of him and his ex splitting up. Tell him once that you are broke. See what he does. Then you can judge him.</h1>
