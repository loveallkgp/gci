<p>Please post this. I'm a guy cheated by my lover. I'm sad that i loved him. sad that i trusted him more than everyone. He carries on relationship with other guys when i'm with him. He searches for new guys. he got caught to me last Friday. Bll this days thought gay love was also true. but no longer think so. Today i keep a full stop to my gay life. Cause many seek for sexual pleasure and time pass. for all the people who read this, Don't play with someones love because all don't love you for fake. Don't take love for granted. Gays are also human so treat us properly cause we are not toys. And yes the Bi guys wont criticize all of you but those sex seekers Please don't play with feelings. Today as a gay i will fade away from this society cause of the pain of gay love. Obvious i cant be straight but i loved my boyfriend to marry him but after he did this to me i better live for my parents happiness as they want.Thank you. Wishing everyone here to get a bright future ahead. with love, rakesh. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, you dated a cheater. I understand your anger and sadness but it's not because that he was gay.</h1>
<p>Love is love and it's never a gay love or straight love. 
You have only one life. You cannot take break from gay life just as straights can't take break from their straight lives. Take a break from life itself. Don't date guys for a while and focus on yourself. What ever you decide in this impending sadness, you will regret it later. Think with a sane and stable mind.</p>
