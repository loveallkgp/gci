<p>Hello, the Amazing, Spontaneous, Sensible and Adorable Admin.</p>
<p>I am 25 and in a very serious LDR. As year goes on, me and my lifestyle has drastically changed. I was once a sex lover who can have sex sex and sex anytime and anywhere. Also was against relationship propaganda. As time goes on, I realised what life is all about, maturity meets me and self respect can be seen. Then I started having a new life when I found my guy and we are happily together now.</p>
<p>My point here is, why am I always taken for granted as a sex seeker, sex object, sl*t, etc.etc. You know what I mean? When you already change yourself so much to be a better person, why are those past image still haunts you and bothers you? Any point you may add will settle my confusing thoughts cos I know you always have the solutions to any problem...hehe...I mean I trust you, you will have an answer for me. Cheers and Thanks Admin </p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks but there are two of us here. See darling, at the time when you were seeking only sex, were you feeling bad about that? I guess yes, that is only why the image of it still haunts you. You were seeking sex, but you were honest with that. Atleast you didn't fake love to just get sex with random and innocent people, did you? If you did not then that is one positive point about you. But at the end of the day people with receptive mind do get mature as the reality dawns upon them. If you don't feel good about your past then leave it there only. You cannot change it, so why bother on it? The focus should be on those decisions which can make you forget it or even make you even more better as a human. Also, if your boyfriend doesn't have any problems with it then honestly, slay that past. It's not important at all.</h1>
