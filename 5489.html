<p>I'm in love with my best friend.
Being born and brought to a conservative tradition in NE India, it is practically impossible to come out open without hurting every1 i hold most dear. I am 23yrs doing my MA in Bangalore.
Dont know when i develop the liking for men bt I was always a bit girly since my childhood. I met my friend who is a year junior from hostel when I was doing my +2. We were very close. so close so that even the warden will purposely seperately us even when we have recreation time.
I dont have any feelings for him back then, just a friend until recently when he came down to Bangalore to visit his gf. Since he is new I offer him my place to stay. there everything begin to start. he didnt know my feelings yet. and i dont think i ever will have the guts to reveal it.
I donno whats happening to me.................................</p>
<h1>GCI- Yikes! Better come out to the reality and think for every alternative before you take a stupid step and ruin your things with him.</h1>
