<p>Hiii friends.... </p>
<p>Even though I laugh , smile , talk , dance . I m honestly not happy within ...  I have a boyfriend and I m trying my hard to be committed . But the fact is that I m from Kolkata and I honestly need a Punjabi sardar to fall in love with . I have a boyfriend who is of my height ... butni need a man who is taller than me . I m 5"6 and a half ... and so is he 5"6 and a half ... I need a goodlooking Sikh sardar who can protect me , who is educated , sophisticated . I belong to a well to do with family . I need someone of my type I mean of my choice ... for me class , standard , sophicticasy , matters a lot ... I just need a good-looking Sikh sardar from Kolkata just for love yaar .... Ab me kiya karu me apne bf ko Ye b nai bol sakta ki me tumse pyaar nai kartha , Usse chod b nai saktha neither can I live with him ... M NOT DESPERATE  BEHIND SEX ....I m just hunting for a man of my choice .... I m 19 years old guy ... and I m confused </p>
<p>$ABBY : u don't wanna break up with present and you are hunting for a guy already ??? first make your mind and tell him that you two shall not continue relationship... i mean he wants a tall guy and you want a sardar guy then why do you two are even having a relation which is just a burden ..?? go talk to him and find the solution .. first break up with him and then find another guy . and kolkata has many sikh guys there so find one for yourself.</p>
