<p>Dear friends, at the onset, I want to warn you, my today's confession is a pessimistic rant. So those who dont want to dampen their spirits, skip this one. Today I want to confess a deep fear, which I usually try to ignore. Fear about life after 50. I'm not even half way there yet. But still it haunts me occasionally. I have come to terms with my sexuality. I'm confident I can live alright in this society, working in the profession I love. When I think of life ahead, I can see many sexual flings and very few short serious relationships here and there. But I dont see a lifelong relationship happening. That leaves me more or less single as I race towards 50s. In our 20s, 30s, most of us still have our parents around, who care for us, no matter what. But after them, we'll be left alone. And how true is "Health is Wealth"! Until we are healthy, we can deal with anything. What if I end up having no one on my side when, say, I got admitted in hospital for a simple surgery? Friends and relatives are there, but they cant replace parents or life partners. To summarize, I dread lonely life after retirement with all stupid health issues and no one to care about me. There is no proper social structure to support lonely aged in our country. I often go to nearby oldage homes to spend time with them. I never wish to end up living in one of those sketchy places. I know this is not unique to our gay community. Even unmarried heterosexuals may have similar fears. Sometimes I wish I could live happily till 50-55 and end it there abruptly! 
What are your thoughts?</p>
<h1>GCI- "What" and "if", innocent words, but when they are combined together, they have the power to incite the feelings in you, that can either make your future, or can give you a serious mental disease. There are a million scenarios that are possible. If you are imaginative and a pessimist, then you can literally ruin your life.</h1>
<p>Try to keep those words separate and work for your future. Not against it.</p>
