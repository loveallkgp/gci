<p>I m a 19 year old guy from kolkata...and currently doing mbbs..these past years during my 12th std times...i was afraid to come out...but ever since i became more open...i found true frnds and lots of supports from the community...some became best friends for life...so i thought exposing myself little by little...i told some of my straight friends...they are cool with it..told my sister...she was so happy...but when i told my cousin sister she freaked out and said that we dont belong to high-class societies..your parents..grandparents will want u to settle with a girl.and they will die of shame..i somehow convinced her i just find men attractive sometimes...so as to make her believe its not serious...otherwise she could have exposed to everyone ...and i couldnt take that pressure at the start of my career...but now as she is convinced..she wants me to see with a girl...i have many girlfriends...but can i tell one of them to pretend to be my lover infront of my didi</p>
<h1>GCI- Only if your friend agrees so to keep the creeps away from her. But anyways, make your real sister talk to your cousin sister!</h1>
