<p>Hello when I was small I read a story about how a baby tiger raised by a family on veg food grows up and eats veg only. However one day he sniffs the bleeding finger of a family member and turns nonveg and eats up all of them. I was deeply influenced by this story so I never had gay sex. Bcoz once I have sex with male I will turn gay and want it more and more and after marriage will be difficult to please wifr. So I make guys dress up as women before having sex with them. That way I will remain straight always.</p>
<h1>GCI- Fake alert. First thing, people who do this are stupid. Second thing, people who make confessions like this are even more stupid.</h1>
<p>Anyway, there is a slight blunder in your confession. Tiger is meant to be a non veg animal so it embraced its true identity which you didn't look at. Was it so hard to understand?</p>
