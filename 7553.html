<p>I'm just 22, he's 28...He  works with me, and i travel with him to office.. He's married, I'm single, he's one of those straight bad boys, and I'm bi top. I'm attracted to him since last 2 years but he's hungry for girls. We talk about girls a lot, cause we both love girls(yup, again, cause I'm bi) but he doesn't know i got strong crush on him.. He has features of channing tatum(not kidding at all) and i do everything for him, i compliment him on stupid things, i always smile looking at him, but many times he becomes rude and it breaks my heart. Sometimes in jokes, he asks me to suck his dick, and i act angry when he says something like this, but in my mind, i start imaging blowing him off.. Hehe.. I really wanna have sex with him, even i can become bottom for him(i know it'll hurt a lot and i won't enjoy it). He loves his wife really much. Even if I'd be able to somehow do some intimacy with him, i won't be able to face him or talk to him again... Please guys, help me with your precious suggestions </p>
<h1>GCI- Everyone wants to fuck someone new. Like your friend, who loves his wife, but do talk about girls with you.</h1>
<p>Listen, if you think that it will ruin your friendship, the best idea would be to stay away. In the meantime, you can organize an orgy with other bi people to satisfy your lust. Go shag somewhere else, or bang a wall.</p>
