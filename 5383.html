<p>23 yrs of life taught me many lessons and many years of gay account helped me understand bright and dark side of gay world.... I wrote my observations and trying to post few of them so that other's could try to inculcate these for their better......
1. Happiness is a journey not a place, I respectfully disagree. Happiness is a place within yourself. If you cannot find it there, you will not find it anywhere.
2. My life is far from perfect. I have made mistakes but I am happy with my life &amp; the people in it. If you are no longer in my life, remember u made that choice!
3. I regret nothing in my life (bcz i was not wrong) even if my past was full of hurt, I still look back and smile, because my past made me who I am today and made me stronger :)
4. People are like a box of chocolates... Some you regret ever trying, some are good, a few are great... and the nutty ones you keep around for a rainy day... ;)
5. Life isn't about reaching a destination, it's about enjoying the journey.... :) :)
I hope I m not wrong n if I am do lemme know... :)</p>
