<p>We (gays) fight with our own-selves first and then later accpet who we r and think about the whole society thing and why are we put back ..why cant we show our emotions n love...why possibly such a discrimination society and religion were made in the first place...how others feel about us and all such things that make us more intellect n matured and thinker than most most most of the straights. But but but
It makes me sad to hear bullshit discriminating confessions regarding sexuality, age, race, nationality, caste, etc. etc. 
One guy was like India-Pakistan issue... I mean seriously???? God, people we are those who are discriminated the MOST in our society and again rather than understanding to boycott all the discriminating ,  you guys r promoting other forms of discriminations...Amazing !!! -_-</p>
<h1>GCI- Ugh tell me about it. One guy went on calling me pseudo-secular. I have seen people from india and pakistan who have been living together. I think that these people who follow these hardcore ideologies, are the ones that our world has never been in peace till now.</h1>
