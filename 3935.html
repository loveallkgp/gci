<p>Hey everyone, thanks for ur generous comments to my first confession. I'm back with with another confession, hmmm...I would rather say, sharing my thoughts than confession.
Though I kept denying that m a homosexual to the the world, I always had a thought of redemption. We all know that it's a big bad world, and surving here is no less than living with a rope tightly cuffed around your neck...we can hardly breathe...suffocating! Moreover, the world's orthodoxy dominates our thoughts these days. I'm not saying that the way we deal with other LGBT people, is wrong...ie. what most of the people usually do is, they make a fake profile...will include some hunky pictures...will categorize whether if top, bottom, or versatile...and, if they proceed that chat further also, it will hardly survive for few sex spans. To, this I'm saying is not humane! I am well acknowledged, that coming out to others is like taking a leap of faith, so it's hard for everyone to do that. And, whoever does that, they are heroes in their own life... Salute! ...and, people like me, and many more, we prefer to remain in closet. I agree we are scared... Family driven fools... I care a lot about my family, would never risk their happiness for my freedom. The other side might be, they accepting my status, but that side is hardly lighted...so, i prefer to remain in a closet. One more thing to everyone, from today onwards let's not prejudice our kind, which has already been categorized by our world. We, should be proud that we are sensitive...and most wonderful creation. And, accepting to the world or not, however we should learn to accept to ourselves. Let's live upon the proverb that "united we stand, divided we fall", and, certainly, one day we will surely find colours in monochrome.</p>
<h1>GCI- Everything is good but what irked me was the part of the family. I love my family too, more than anything else but if they can't accept me the way I am then it will be a biggest blow for me. But I cannot forget my identity and put up a fake face just to please the people peeping into our family's activities. Life is not a bollywood movie every time. Melodrama doesn't serve good.</h1>
