<p>Dev Singh here :- ...</p>
<p>Guys few days back I was added to a group , unknowingly I trusted them as my friends and revealed few personal secrets out to one and all of a sudden 2 guys who i trusted them as my friemds started pulling my leg Down , they started humiliating me , and taunting me . They got personally offensive and the reason what they were rude and mean for was my habit of commenting on each and every confession ... they raged me , humiliated me , offended me personally only because I comment in all the confessions and tryna help as far as my brain support me ...</p>
<p>Guys I just wanna warn all of u there , never trust anyone here ... here people are hypocritically offensive and are inhumane creatures who can only use u for time being . Here I don't think word called friendship or word called trust exists ... guys never be a victim of raging or humiliation . Learn to fight for Ur self . Give a big bang at their asses because if not the law we have many ways to punish them in our way and I know that they will still target me either by confessions or by smoother way and tryna put me down .... but I still wanna tell u guys in the name of fun or sarcasm never tolerate anybody's shit ..... so be ware .... just because I was sweet to them mad polite to them.they took an advantage of my innocence . So what I had 20 bfs atleast they didn't come to clean my bfs asses .... so guys be ware of these morons....</p>
<h1>GCI- Ugh! That is why you should take time to reveal your secrets. Trust never happens in 2 hours or 2 weeks. I take around 2 months to fully trust someone to let them know of my deepest secrets only if they are worthy. You cannot trust someone in a matter of few days. That was surely an immature move. Anyways, I know this for sure, trust and friendship does exist. I have been blessed with both in 6 people in my life. :)</h1>
