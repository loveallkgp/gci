<p>I hv anger issues. I react too much on just little things :( .I m living in with my bf and he has to deal with it.Though i say sorry after that n he forgives me too with a hug n kiss but still i feel really bad from inside. Lyk yesterday he was asking me to go out for a drive with him.I was busy with office work so i told him not to do.And he start insisting more thn i throw my cell phone in anger and yelled at him very very rudely.Today i say him sorry and he just said its okay mistake z f9 i should not force u.And even he gave me his cell for today and was saying he will get mine repaired while returning.M feeling worse and crying literally.He is so caring and me? Its not first time i m doing this..it happens often ..i try to manage anger but it is not happening!</p>
<h1>GCI- Because you have something special. You have to work on your anger. There are proper steps to calm down yourself when you get angry but it require your efforts. If you want to do something about it, you have to work on it. Maybe seek some professional help or atleast meditate. Meditation can help you calm your mind and focus.</h1>
