<p>Okay so i guess my last confession was 12-18 months ago .. So Hi again after a long long time :D Okay so I have been watching a Korean Drama Series "Playful Kiss" and I realize how much similar it is to my first love .. Watching the show took me back when i was 15 .. So this guy lets just call him Tutu. So Tutu was my classmate, till that time I had looked at a few boys before but I never fantasized over them. Tutu was extremely cute but i never looked at him that way he was just a classmate to me. Then one day (a day before the exams) he came to my house coz he had to return my notebook it was raining cats and dogs that day n he was completely drenched, when I opened the door for him n saw him in that state i was mesmerized. He was looking absolutely stunning. I masturbated that night thinking of him :P . I started following him from the next day we became really good friends. We joined a coaching class in 10th and used to go together. I always cherish those cold winter night when while returning from coaching it used to get so cold that we used to sit very close it the auto/rickshaw. Then God played His trick and we were separated in 11th as we went to different schools we used to talk on phones but i saw him only a few time during those 2 years (Those years were absolutely awful). After 12th both of us fared bad in the entrance exams so I decided to go to Kota (Allen) I asked him to come too and he came. We were roommates in Kota. I cannot tell you how happy I was. But within a few days I came to know that he has a GF. My entire world came crashing down. I remember I was smiling(or rather trying to smile) when he was telling me about his GF, i cried a lot that night. I was totally for a month or two n then i thought if i show him how much i love him maybe he will start loving me back. I tried and tried but I failed instead of falling in love we were always fighting. At times i was so depressed that I thought of killing myself. He probably knew that i was  gay n that i love him still sometimes he was so nice that i felt that maybe he loves me too but then hours of scolding :( In the end I thought that it was impossible to cope with the pressure he is creating so I left Kota early and went back home. A few years have passed now . At that time I was really mad at him for not loving me back but now when I look back I realize that I was a kid in love and so i was doing crazy things but at the same time he was a kid too it must have been difficult for him seeing a guy coming on to him when he was so straight . Many times I have called him up and tried to apologize but he starts shouting at me whenever I start talking about Kota.  So I apologize here .. Well Tutu I'm sorry for falling in love with you but I will always cherish those few great moments with you (like when you used to defend me or when you made maggi for me when i was ill or when you planned a great surprise party on my birthday or when u went out with me for dinners (which i consider as a date) or when u embraced me when I was crying) a big Thank you (Muttu Swami(Tutu)) for these moments and sorry for the way i acted or when i made you uncomfortable. I hope maybe next life we both are gay and these things have a happy ending. :D</p>
