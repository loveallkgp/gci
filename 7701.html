<p>Hi all, so I already posted one of my short stories on me n my partner moving to Australia, what I'm saying now is the recent few days' events that made me realize why I fell in love with him more.....  I m a college going student I'm 20 doing my masters and well he's working as a TL in an MNC, we used to meet up every single day i.e he used to leave me to college everyday and he'd go n work till the night...  We don't stay together but we meet at a common bus stop for both of us.... Just recently his shift timings changed and as a result we've had less time to meet up.....  On Friday as usual I light a candle at Christ's feet in a church.. That fortunate day I was late to class and I couldn't light the candle, I told my hubby that I couldn't do it he said no problem I'll come n do it with u, he left all his work came to see me in college, took me to church n lit the candle with me... He's Muslim but he said anything for u baby and we both got a bus n left...  His office was on the way so I told him bye I'll go home safe u get down, he was quiet....  His stopping came n he Nevr got out...  I was like kyu....  He said tumsey pyaar karta hoon, I won't leave u alone, how can I leave u now to go alone....  He held my hand whole way made sure he dropped me at home and told my dad take care of my baby....  Drank water n left....  It's pretty far from my home to his office about 2.5 hours n he did it for me....  My dad told me the only good thing that u did with urself apart from studying is to get a guy like him.....  My mom said shut up now n bathe u stink like a pig..  Hahaha the day ended happily college bi Hua n my candle was also lit....  My baby reached office n well the rest u'll get to know soon....</p>
