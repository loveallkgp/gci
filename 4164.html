<p>Hello Everyone!
Good to see all my gay friendly ppl here on this page!
I'm in Malaysia pursuing my higher studies and have got of Indians and various country people in my College campus. And there are two Lesbian girls one is from Manipur and the other one from Thailand, they came out to their friends and I'm not sure of their family n relatives. But after coming out, they used to roam together, romance at restaurant, bus everywhere and ppl and their friends who look them from outside doesnt get awkward or anything. Instead they welcome for coming out. And those two girls are really very happy in all means And whenever i see them i get jealousy a bit and I want them to be happy n together forever I conclude that coming out is easier for Lesbians than Gays! #GAY_life

<h1>GCI- Hell no! In a society where females are already oppressed, its never easy for a lesbian to come out. There have been cases when lesbians are forcefully made to sleep with their cousins to "cure" her disease just because she has never been with a man. Its downright evil here sometimes.</h1>
