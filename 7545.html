<p>Hi GCI readers,
This is not exactly a gay confession but i don't have any other platform to share this..
Gay  Closeted  Introvert  Shy  Lonely and now Depression..This is my my life. I am 23 and studying. Everything is fine as long as I have classes, exams, assignments and stuff. My classmates call and text me for their doubts and I'm happy to help them. It also provided me with the minimum social contact which i love. Exams ended 2 weeks ago, since then almost no one texts me. As a shy person, I never go out for party, dinner with friends, etc since nobody invites me. I'm actually happier that way- when someone invites me , I make up excuses and try to avoid meeting them. 
Some days i tell myself " I should end this behaviour" and text friends from school or gay friends  and try to meet them. We will usually fix up a date by the end of the chat. I'll feel excited for that time, but soon I'll start feeling anxious-  what to wear, where to go, should I take bike/ bus.... After I planned every step, I'll wait for their confirmation the day before and it won't come. I sometimes text the guy with general - Hi...what's up... but he will never mention the meeting. 
My dad left home when I was small and mom goes to work (she works hard for me and I don't want to trouble her), I'm the only son so I'm completely alone for 9-10 hours. I sometimes get addicted to porn but have a control. I don't drink or smoke. Recently there was pride march in my city and some friends invited me to come but I just didn't feel comfortable...though I want to help others in the closet and do something for this community some day.
I'm not really expecting sympathy by typing this...I actually don't know why I typed this, I think it relaxes me... Love you all.. bye :) </p>
