<p>Hi all, i am a third year engineering student from kota. Today, i found out that my bf of 2.5yrs was having sexdates with a lot of guys up until the start of our relationship. I don care about his past, but the fact that he hid everything from me makes me feel sad. I also came to know that he got involved with some guys during our relationship of which he kept me completely in the dark. Everything happened except the sex i think which he says he did not do it, that is actuly what i believed even before asking him cus i know he wont cheat on me. Main usse bahut pyaar karthi hoon and want to forget and forgive him. But I feel depressed thinking he did not tell me anything. And he is on pr talking and meeting random people which he says is no big deal though he knows very well that i don like it. But he spending lot of time on pr and having a fake profile here on fb still hurts me a lot. Has any of you been through this? I dont know what to do. How can i make him understand? Please advice me.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Yeah ok....try to watch some movies on polyamory and polyandry.....its u too who needs to understand his psyche.</h1>
<p>P.S- Maybe he is a shallow randomly hooking up gay guy or maybe he is trying to understand what satisfaction looks like by sleeping with men out there.
N.B- Both of u have to come to a conclusion about being different from each other in terms of sexual practices. Talk it out in detail. Goodluck.</p>
