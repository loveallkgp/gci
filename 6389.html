<h1>GCI- Hold on, let me get this straight. A guy loves you, but you have a crush on your friend(or the new guy. I am confused) and your friend got to know about it. You can't be in a relation with a new guy, but you can be his friend. Right?</h1>
<p>For your friend I'd suggest, just talk with him. He is your friend, he should understand. As for that guy, be clear on what you want. He is also a human. Do not disrespect his feelings.</p>
