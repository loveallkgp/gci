<p>hi admin...</p>
<p>If u remember a person who came out to his family while watching satyamev jayate episode. i m that guy..yes i m out to my family as gay. 
i have stooped dating people now donno i dnt feel lyk meeting any of dem, i dnt have sex till!!
i donno wht phase this is..i m active i m inactive..</p>
<p>i used to read all confessions here and dere replies..but donno why i dont feel like reading all dese..to reply any of dem, all circle around the same issues over nd over again..</p>
<p>suddenly i feel as that if i want to leave all this fb pr grndr and just stop feeling gay!!</p>
<h1>GCI- I distinctly remember u dude. And my my u r in such a bad shape. Well lemme make it all clear to u once again.</h1>
<p>U r in this PHASE because-
1- U have crossed the phase of struggle,fear, anxiety and rejection.
2- U have become self contended for the time being which is a very good sign.
3- U have started to saturate with being gay but its limiting for u because u r not able to do anything for urself and neither u r doing much for the community, if I am not wrong.</p>
<p>Dos-
1- Now take one step further and start doing things u love.
2- U can inspire, motivate and help people of our community to cope up with their issues.
3- Join online community groups like Harmless Hugs, Yaariyan or some NGO which ever serves the purpose for u to move to the next level of being gay.
4- U must not overthink about being gay but can think of what can u do more by being gay.</p>
<p>See, there is much more to explore when u serve humanity. And u my boy need to understand that life revolves around the periphery of same issues in a different manner and its a cyclic process. What do u think of us??? Don't we get tired of the same issues again and again but have we lost sanity or our peace of mind??NO... bcoz we as admins have understood that the more we do for our community it will always fall short in serving mankind. Hope I m able to put it candidly and explicitly.
STOP being overloaded with thoughts and try to feel new things in life now and ur sexuality is a large part of it, agreed! but that doesn't mar ur growth as a human dude.</p>
