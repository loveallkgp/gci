<p>I am in relation with a guy for 3 months. He only has sex but refuses to hug or kiss me. He says he is bisexual and doesn't want to turn gay by doing all this. He also abuses me when angry calling me a hijda and gud ki aulad. I love him a lot and want to stay with him forever but don't know how to keep him happy.</p>
<h1>GCI- Holy cow and the shit of all the planets! What kind of a lover says this kind of derogatory shit to his beloved???</h1>
<p>P.S- Honey, he is the byproduct of shitty patriarchy and entrenched internal homophobia and I see something very ugly coming if he continues like this for this with u.....DECIDE UR FATE ASAP.
P.P.S- U need to understand that he is having issues of being lgbt himself and is suffering from self hate as well, so u are not his therapist if he is not willing to see this and u can only save urself at the end which is quite near of this pseudo relationship of urs.</p>
