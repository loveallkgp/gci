<p>Hi admin,</p>
<p>It may sound stupid what I am about to say. I work in a company in Bangalore and in my office, there's this guy who I like. Earlier every time I would pass by his bay, he would look at me and I would look back at him. For a really long time, this confusing eye contact shit happened, we sort of had a small conversation as well. After that he went on leave for almost 2 weeks and he has stopped looking at me since he returned. Like I mentioned in the beginning it will sound stupid to a lot of people but this is causing too much of confusion in my head.
Is there any fucking way to have a conversation with him? Given the fact that we work in different teams and don't have mutual friends.</p>
