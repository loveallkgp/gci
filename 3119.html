<h1>GCI- You can have equally normal life while being gay. You can make some gay friends and discuss your life with them. Its not that big of a deal. For once, just stop being stressed about your sexuality. You have to think about it only till the time you are comfortable with it. Don't make it that big of a deal. For the 20 things you are, 19th would be you being gay. Your 19 qualities still demand equal attention. You accepted your sexuality, keep it aside but be proud of you being a special amidst the mainstreamers. Also, be true to yourself. That's the key to a healthy living.</h1>
