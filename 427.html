<p>male 17+</p>
<p>actually i want to move on my life from current situation and my current situation is i felt for wrong guy , i proposed him twice , he refused and he said to me to stay free and be good friends only .. so i sacrifice it decided to stay as a friend and started talking with him as a good friend only !! and now he is ignoring ..
he doesnt reply msges after reading it and lately gives unrealistic excuses that he stays busy nowdays!!
but i have noticed many times that he likes, comments , updates on his fake fb!!
thats why i realized that he is just ignoring me.. so i blocked him but still it is hard to to forget him thats why i need more friends to talk with!!
it will make me not to think about him!!
anyone then coment here add me!!
