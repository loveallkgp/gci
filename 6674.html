<p>Hello!! 
So here I go!</p>
<p>Few days ago while texting with my friend I told her that I wanted to share something very personal with her! i told her that no one knows about it. So the next day in college she asked me that what did I want to tell. I told her that I will tell about it later. She started asking stupid questions like have u slept with someone or If i am in love with her lol and if I was suffering from some serious disease?!! told NO. I gave her a hint that there is something common between me and Apple's CEO. lol But she didn't get it.
So the next day again in college she kept on asking me. I asked her to meet me somewhere alone. </p>
<p>So in the evening the same day we met near a lake.Before leaving the home to meet her I kept on thinking that how would I tell her about it!! That how would she react to it? I was so scared. So many questions were going through my mind. So finally I met her.
I asked her if she found anything about Tim cook? she said she didn't find anything. We were just walking around the lake and I was gathering all my courage to tell her. To make it easy for myself I asked her that if she knew why The U.S.A has recently been in news? she said bcos of gay marriage legalization. And with a very horrifying expression she asked me ARE YOU GAY??
I was blank for a moment.  I was like have u gone nuts? I am not gay!!
She asked what is it about then? spit it out!!
It was a now or never kind of situation for me!
She asked me to take my time. After some time
I told ha vahi jo tune bola abhi. 
kya?
ha mai Gay hu!!
Tu mjak kr rha hai na? she said. 
I turned around and started crying. And at the same moment it started raining too! I knew it already that I would cry while telling about my sexuality to her.
I thought she would throw me into the lake :p Thank god she didnt!
she kept on staring at my face!
She acted a bit homophobic. And that was normal as she didn't know much about homosexuality. But she is very open minded!
And then there was a long question and answer session between us. I told her everything i knew about homosexuality and different sexual orientations. she was still not believing it!
But finally she accepted it. 
Before going back home we ate bhel and while eating she asked about my crushes :p and how do two guys enjoy? I asked her to watch some gay porn :p 
It is the bravest thing I have ever done in my life! :)
Today we met in college and nothing has changed between us! We are more close now!</p>
<p>If you are thinking of coming out to someone ask yourself if u really trust that person? And if your heart says a YES go ahead without wasting your time! 
Love to everyone &lt;3</p>
