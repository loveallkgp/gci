<p>Update to confession #1099:</p>
<p>Read my confession carefully again and stop blasting on me like bombs.</p>
<p>No where I said that you should not have sexual desires and stop having sex. You are free to have sex. Even I have sexual desires and I have no problem to agree with sex, but to quench my sexual desires I will not go to every guy around and demand him to fuck me or get fucked by me. And it's not bad to talk about sex, but it's not right to be a sex-seeker and ask every guy to fulfill your sexual desires. Can't you make a monogamous relationship and quench your sexual thirst with your partner?</p>
<p>We are gays, not whores. Being gay doesn't mean that we should go to every person and demand sex. It doesn't mean that we should do only sex in our lives. Being gay doesn't mean only sex, sex and sex. Being gay beyond just sexual desires. Jabhi bhi dekho sirf sex ki hi padi rehti hai. Sex karne ke sevaai kuchh aata nahi hai kya? Most Indian gays mein dekha jaaye toh saari baatein sirf sex pe aa ke atak jaati hai.</p>
<p>People call gays prostitutes, whores, sex-seekers, and many blah blahs, but but none is going to affect you. You people are only made up for having sex with multiple partners. You know who it affects the most? The people who doesn't take part in these things, those who don't deserve these tags. Why? Because they are dragged in the same line of sex-seekers, even though they are out of such things.</p>
<p>And what's wrong in standing up for our fundamental rights? Can't I stand for my rights? Am I doing something wrong? If no, then why are you people reacting in such way that I have commanded to murder somebody? For you people gay rights is just a joke and worthless. I know standing for the rights means nothing to you, as sex is your first priority. You will die if you won't have sex. For you people having sex is much much and much more important than getting/fighting for your fundamental rights. You will always scold us and shout on us for doing something right.</p>
<p>And stop dragging heterosexuality in the discussion. Compare the percentage of heterosexuals engaging in sex-seeking with those of the homosexuals in India. Obviously, the percentage of homosexuals will be the greater. They are doing these things doesn't mean we should also do the same. It's all like, "Woh to kuwein mein kood raha hai, hum bhi koodenge." And, by the way, no two wrongs gonna going to make one right.</p>
<p>If you want to do hook-ups and sex-seeking then do it, but kindly don't bring innocents and the undeservings to fall in the same label. They are affected more than you by those labels. Because of sex-seekers the people believe that the other people of the gay community are also like this.</p>
<p>And if homosexuality is all about sex-seeking and multiple hook-ups, then I am saying haq se homosexuality will NEVER ever be legalised in India. After that, don't roam mourning the defeat.</p>
<h1>Viv- Well the argument about heteros indulging in these activities is about the retort you can say to them if they bombard you with prejudiced stuff. And at the end of the day, every brain has a different thinking. The best you can do is to stay true to your own and not let the world bother you.</h1>
