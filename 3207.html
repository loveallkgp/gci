<p>Its kind of strange. I've never ask for any help. I'm dating this boy from DU and he is only 20 years old and he has no experience in sex or love making. Although I've done with many but this is my first virgin. Although I told him we could wait but he says he wants to do it and we have been dating for 11 months now. He wants to do it on our anniversary that is on 20 Aug. Now my question is how do I prepare him mentally and physically. Out of all guys I dated he is the cleanest he didn't even know how to kiss and he is to precious for me. Admin how should I prepare him? Give me some helpful tips. Should I decorate the room play romantic songs. Uugh I don't know anything :/</p>

<h1>GCI- The only thing that you have to do is to make him comfortable with the whole idea of total intimacy. Start it slow like turtle pace by making him easy. Decoration, romantic songs and aromatic air freshners do set up the mood but all he should have is trust in you that it will be a one incident that will be special for him. Just make it special.</h1>
