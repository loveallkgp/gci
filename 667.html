<p>My Metro Affair...
Okay, so this is again one of the stories where one guy sees another in a metro and wants to connect with him through the post.
But no matter how similar it may sound to the rest, but its very special to me.
I CAN NOT FORGET HIM.
So I got on to this metro on yellow line headed to Gurgaon in Morning around 10.30. and after a few stations, I see a guy at the opposite corner of the wagon. And suddenly, we shared a look. and Boy, that was something. 
We surreptitiously kept looking at each other. I can still reminisce him shaping his 'Raveer Singh' beard, that well tucked Red and white shite with Blue denims. He has got to be the hottest boy I've shared a "look" with on Metro.
Well sadly I was with my friends. Couldn't even signal him properly about how I liked him so much.
And then I had to get off. He was probably going to Gurgaon.
I hope I see him sooon again. :D </p>
