<p>Hii admin.. Umm the situation is worst here with me, actually on last Saturday I broke up casually with my bf n thought that he will realize my value.. and then he said sorry too,many times and tried to make me up but I refused cuz I was very upset at that time , he was begging not to,leave him but it was Just normal cuz I knew that ill b bak to him soon Jus wanted to show ma bit of anger then when again on Wednesday when I called him I said sorry too many times but he said that he don't want to b in relationship with me anymore not because he's angry but because he's no gettin feelin lyk he used to get b4 :'( I tried to make him up too much though I met him too today,,my hands are all cutted though I was contantly cryin on metro station in front of every one.. Beggin him not to leave me but den too he didnt agree N i have not eaten anything from last two days but still it does not matter to him,, he's showing care also towards me.. But on the other side h's saying we'll only be frnz n ntng else,n its his,last decision., IM not finding any way to get outta this pain xcpt to suicide even I rejected ma ex girlfrnd's proposal Jus for him but he's not ready to listen. ma whole year will ruin cz of this n this year Is very crucial for me as IM preparin for mbbs..thers nly one option left with me n that is jump from ma terrace I really love that guy lik hell don't know wat happened to him suddenly.. Plzz plzzz plzz admin tell me any way.. To get him bak or get outta dis siuation</p>
