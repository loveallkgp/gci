<p>I m now 40,
when I was in school fell in with a class mate, that was one sided love, I kept on yearning for a few years but in vain,
when I went to college, suddenly my best friend and I started sex relationship, though I was his bottom always, this went on 10 years,
and suddenly he said we should stop all this as we r not kids now, actually his family was pressurising him for marriage, so he married,
as for as I know he was also gay, n like men only,</p>
<p>I was than 29 my family also put pressure for marriage, but I declined, my parents asked again and again, asked reason, but I did not tell about my sexual orientation, time passed and they stopped thinking about my marriage,</p>
<p>in the mean time I yearned a lot for sex, but where to go, I did not know, so I was leading a sex less life, sometimes sex desire so overpowered that I wanted to become naked in some lonely areas to get a man, but I never dared for that even,
now I m living all alone, my parents do not want to live with me as they like to live with my brother s family, and his children in a healthy environment according to them,</p>
<p>when I saw all around, I saw my brother sister and cousins and even my best friend, and the boy I fell in love, all are living happily with there families,
and I m all alone, with vacant heart, and vacant house,
sex also haunts a lot,
whenever my friend says, tu bhi shaadi kar leta to achha hota,</p>
<p>kabhi kabhi lagta ha maine shadi na kar ke bahut galti ki,</p>
<p>was I wrong in my decision???? </p>
<h1>GCI- Considering about the person of your age group, when you were young the situation was entirely different. There was not much awareness. I can neither blame you because you wasted your youth on sex and after that your friend went to get married nor can I say anything in favor. It is a very tough situation for me to say anything.</h1>
