<p>Hi Admin, i am a boy living in ghy. I met a boy by fb in 2009. We were from two different distant places (but both living in ghy now). At first we were just friends with many likings and interests in common. Soon we got closer and became best friends. We used to share everything. We were getting much closure and in 2011 we realized that we've feelings for each other. In 2012 only we met for the first time and had some physical contact in private. After that our bond became stronger and we had some sort of sex many times from then. But we both knew that we cannot continue that in our society openly and for long and we agreed to be best friends forever and continue our relationship untill we are engaged with some girl. But gradually in 2013 he started responding less to me. In the ending weeks of 2013 i found that he had been lying to me about certain very important private things. So we had a quarrel and parted and i decided to end all these. After a couple of months i entered in a relationship with a girl i fancied. In the meantime the boy contacted me with apology. I couldn't help myself forgiving him totally. Months passed and we got closer again and had physical contact twice (i regret that and feel i should've never done this again). I don't know if i was cheating my gf but i love her from the core of my heart. We agreed to be best frnds forever again. But recently he reduced contacting with me and many a times i feel like i've no more importance in his life. When i talked to him about this he confessed that he has got much important things to work on but i'm still his best frnd. I felt insulted coz i just wanted my old frnd (and yes, without any physical contact). Recenty he again made an agology but i replied rudely. Does doing the same thing again and again and apologizing for it has any meaning? Now i also feel that when we were in a relationship he had shown fake interest just for the sake of having sex and approach me whenever he is in need. It is very much painful for me now and the biggest problem is i can't share it with any of my frnd. Please do suggest something.</p>
<h1>GCI- Sometimes it is better to be a badass in situations like these. Forgive him but do not get laid with him as he expects. His pattern is like ask for an apology, have sex and start ignoring. Going a bit out of the context but it's your sexuality at function once again. No matter how much you try to go away but you have to face the reality one day. And yes you also freaking cheated on your girlfriend. There is no sympathy about this for you.</h1>
<p>Anyway, coming to the matter, if you think that you can easily give in to his touch then stay the hell away from him. If not, then even when he progresses, just make him stop. It's totally upon you.</p>
