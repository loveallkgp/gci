<p>Is There True Love??</p>
<p>I'm one of those stupids who belive there s true love. I will b waiting for my Prince charming for whole lyf until I find one. I believe there will b a prince charming for me in the world.</p>
<p>The one who loves me and hate me at the same time, who wil become my best frnd, who knws all my secrets nd flaws nd still loves me as a bestest buddy.</p>
<p>The one who will take me to early morning walks forcefully nd long night drives . The one who punches me softly whn i mock him nd cuddles me hardly whn i took care of him. The one who will walk with me instead of driving. one who enjoys rain with me..( i just love rain ns i always get wet by playing in rain) . One who come to movies with mee nd hold my hands softly in the dark. The one who takes me to smal tea shops fr mrng tea nd take me to long trips on the holidays.
The one who kisses me on my cheeks whn no one s around. The one who scolds me whn i do something soo stupid that irritates him badly. The one who comes along with to parks in the weekend morng and joins me to tead a book. The one who calls out loud at 4am to accompany him to a bike ride.The one who wil introduce me to his family as best frnd. The one who surprises me by unexpected visits to my college or canteen just to talk to me. The one who loves to talks to me continouslym the one who stays up till mrng by talking to me..</p>
<p>I dont knw if there s a prince charming out there for me.. Bt i knw one thing: True Love does exists. nd I will surely meet mine.</p>
<p>Wish me luck dears.. nd i am praying that all might get their true love.</p>
<p>i dont knw why i wrote this now. But i knw that I am waiting for a true love to occur to me.. </p>
<h1>GCI- Arey yaar tu insaan hai ya expectations ki dukan hai? Try to be the person you want. But that doesn't mean that you will wake your guy at 4 am for a bike ride. One time it will be cute, second time it will be okay but third time he will kick you out of the room. Just saying boo.</h1>
