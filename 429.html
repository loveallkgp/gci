<p>My confession
i hav been in a love wid a guy from standard 8 &amp; now m a bachelor of age 19...we had a 6 years of love moreover we had been in a physical relationship from long time ago...he is 8 years older dan me..a gud looking handsome seductive body guy he is...bt he is a bisexual nt a gay...bt suddenly before 2 weeks i heard dat he is going to get married...rightnow he is far away frm me as i m in capital for my studies....
I truly love dat guy
so guys plzzz suggest me wat shall i do???</p>
<h1>Viv- Being a bi doesn't give anybody a license to do affairs with a gay but get married to a girl to save yourself from the society. Even if a bi is in a relation with a gay, he should carry it forward with full heart. In this case the ultimate loss is of this poor guy. I really have nothing to suggest you buddy. You are so young and going through all of this, it just breaks my heart.But know this, he will be with his family and his wife, you must not sulk in sadness. Be strong and pay attention to your career.</h1>
