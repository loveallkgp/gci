<p>Being gay is cool .but behaving like girls is pathetic . Shushant is a role model . Because u definitely need balls to stand up as a gay in such straight orientated and descriminated society . When people are ready to accpet homosexuality and many had even and many are accpeting homosexuality , by behaving in an awkward way like girls . Shushant is just disgusting straights whoever are ready and had already accepted us . Gays are those who are straight acting men attracted to their own sex . Gayd are not denoted to men who behave like girls . Guys who behave like girls are called chakas ..which I even being a gay is digusted to be around of ... so shushant plz . Stop behaving like chakas and start behaving like a sophisticated and a classy Mr. Gay world india 2014 ... plz maintain our status . U behave like sadakchaps and hijaras  </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, first of all all of these limitations that gays are just straight acting guys attracted to same sex, is just in your head. You cannot decide for anybody just as I cannot decide for you. I am just giving you a different scenario in which you can think equally.</h1>
<p>Next, not only you hate girly gays, but you hate the hijra community too. By looking at the pathetic use of adjectives you have used, the way sushant is acting is wayyy more classier than you. Its LGBT together. If you cannot respect a fellow community member, them I am sorry to say, you are not even human.</p>
