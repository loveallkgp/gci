<p>Well its not exactly a confession but something which I have seen or felt many times even when I am not thinking on the thing 'gay' as such(pun intended). 
Most of the time when I travel by public transportation I chance to have an eye contact with a gay or bi guy(or atleast I guess if my gaydar is reliable enough) and they tend to reciprocate the same. I even had encounters of guys trying to act 'normal' even when I have a hard on standing on the back of them. Normal here means the guys actually don't move away from my side and fixate their ass if by chance I get a boner. This happened twice this month. Recently a well built guy reciprocated by seeing in the same manner I was seeing him(i wasn't ogling to be clear&amp; was at a distance). Many try to look for further action from me but I don't feel like giving numbers or initiating a conversation because I don't feel like doing that all. Groping is not that appreciated by me and I feel mechanical as a sex toy whenever I get groped(I move away from the place at times when my hormones are not high).
The reason for sharing such incidents is that do u guys also feel that it may be the start of a nice romantic story for people who are shy because a good fuck story is not at par with a good romantic story I guess!? Why don't these closet or coy cases act with some amount of guts because who knows there might be a good love story waiting just for them or a life changing experience maybe.</p>
<p>P.S- I am romantic by nature but don't think that love is that easy for people to understand these days. I also understand the tenacity of the gay guys here in our country about what they are doing with their lives and they prefer to have very secretive stuff of their 'gayhood' thus not inviting unwanted situations.</p>
