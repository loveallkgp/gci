<p>Hey guys! I love this page, you guys are doing a great job! Please keep this up! :) &lt;3 Anyways this isn't a confession, but I'd like a suggestion, I am a closet gay from New york. I'm indian btw. I haven't told my family or friends that I'm gay as they are very old fashioned. And I feel for my other indian gay friends who cannot express themselves in india. So just a few years back I started helping gay indians to improve their lives by getting them jobs abroad. I have helped around 65 indians so far getting job with getting nothing from them. (I.e - money) I have paid for their expenses to come abroad. But just a few weeks ago my close friend found out about me and what I've being doing. He wants me to stop, or he will tell my family everything. I don't know what to do? I cannot abandom people who need help. Please suggest something. I'd really appreciate it right now. Thanks for listening!</p>
<h1>GCI- You are a kind of hero for the people whom you have helped. I'd say, just tell your friend everything and if he really is your close friend then he should appreciate your work. I'm not clear with one thing though. Is he being homophobic or he wants you not spend your money on strangers? Or just, you know, if you are settled and all, you can always come out to your family. But I guess talking nicely with your friend would be a good option.</h1>
