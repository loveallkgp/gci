<p>Hello all. Good morning. Here i am to write something about me, not related with my sexuality but simple about me, so here i go...
i used to be very emotionally weak..say before 4 years apprx...i got into a relationship with a guy in my 11th class, nd then got separated with him. Separation from him makes me stronger a lot as i dealt with the complete situation all alone, it was too hard to handle and it took me almost 2 years to move on. Anyways it was one thing, i joined a professional course after completion of my 12th class and then my life changes..in past 2 years i have encountered with 7 accidents..each one resulting in one or other fracture..few months complete bed rest..plus my career it took me 3 attempts to clear intermediate exam...i was depressed not talking with many people..tried to get into relationship but found people are not into emotional attachment but just into sex..then in august 2015 i was able to clear my first group..i was so happy..i scored pretty good marks i thought my life is going to change..new office..new people..i was exited..later in nov 15 i got into another accident..it was major one..i got Condylar fracture(Jaw fracture)..i was holding myself soo strong during past few years..no matter what was happening with me..i hold my cry..never let anyone know what i am going through with..but this fracture broke me out completely from inside...on the next day of this accident i had to gone through an 4 hours operation..they fix Arch bars in my mouth and then fix my teeth with each other through rubber bands..the operation was soo horrible for me, i still remember each and every second of that operation..i wanted to cry after that..but i couldn't..i was not able to eat anything or speak anything for 21 days..was on liquid diet..then till now 15th march i was on semi solid diet..the frustration of eating same thing for more than 3 months tht too 3 times a day...i just started eating chapaties and all just now..i wanted to cry...cry really hard..but i just couldnt..may be because i have been holding things for soo long that now i am unable to cry...i dont know whether you guys are able to understand my situation with this small description or not..!! I still talk with people and laugh with them normally but from inside i am completely broken..its not only about my health..my office sucks too(i dont want to give details about it..but it is consuming me up more)..with all the things happening around me i couldnt concentrate on my studies and still not done with my 2nd group of intermediate..i have my next attempt due in may 2016 and i am not able to concentrate on studies..if i couldnt clear it in this attempt..i have to leave this course..its lyk do or die situation for me..i know i have potential to crack it, but just not able to reconcile myself..i dont have any idea how to come out through this situation so tht i can study..if only anyone out here can help..!!
P.S.-My close friends knows about my hard time..they try to help but i just couldnt express myself in front of them..</p>
<h1>GCIL- There there, do not lose hope so soon dear. This too shall pass and remember there is no rainbow without a storm or a little rain. Hugs from our side and its ok to feel low at times but do not forget that pessimism must make u more aware and optimism will give u the strength to pull it on.</h1>
