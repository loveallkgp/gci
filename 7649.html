<p>Hii! I m 24 and my brother is 26. we hv only our father as our family, so we share a great bonding wd each other. Dad was fixing his marriage wd a girl of an influential family of village. brother denied it but dad is adamant and saying that u wont gt a girl like that, thousands of family want to be their relative, wts your problem? that girl is pretty, educated. But my bro told me he is gay and he cant marry a girl , we cant tell this to our father, he wont understand at all. Bcz during SC judgement in 2013 he himself said court did right, aise to har ladka aapas me shaadi kr lega n smthing on these lines . My bro is crying daily and i guess he has to engage soon. i cant see him like this. I know we both cant stop this as in our indian society so called reputation and chaar log has been given importance.Any suggestions please? my bro told me he cant even imagine kissing a girl how will he do that?? Yr baad me to aur reputation kharab hogi fir.</p>
<h1>GCIL- First of all reach out to a queer friendly NGO and some psychologist to make ur father understand.</h1>
<p>Second support ur bro as much as possible and make him strong enough to face this crisis.
Third try to make everything normal by treating the situation as light and stop being melodramatic for godsake.
Fourth u need to assess ur situation and see whether ur bro can be relocated somewhere or not.
Finally u need to be his rock and take him out of this shit....</p>
<p>KUDOS to u for being such a brother and take a hug from our side. Ur bro is lucky to have a sibling like you!</p>
