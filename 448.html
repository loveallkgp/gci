<p>Reply to the comments left on Confession #441.</p>
<p>I very much know that he is straight, and nothing is gonna ever happen. But the problem is that i cannot MOVE ON.</p>
<p>I figured out 4 ways to make this right.
1) "Have someone else in life" - tried that, didnot work much. Perhaps he was not the right person, or i donot like anyone in a long term basis. The more i get to know someone the more i find flaws in him. :( Anyway, the bottomline is that that option didnot go well.</p>
<p>2) "Closure" - I cannot let that happen at all. It's not like iam afraid to come out to people close to me, it's more like iam too lazy to explain things to them! And coming out is about hell lot explanations!</p>
<p>3) "Concentrate on career and do random sex whenever you need relaxation! No-String-Attached! :P " - Well, even that did not work!Perhaps I find myself kindof sapiosexual.:-/</p>
<p>4) "Keep him out of sight. Cut all the connections." - that's not much of an option, for he is never gonna leave me in peace. He loves my gay ass. :-/</p>
<p>So, donot know if i end up being an utterly sad person or not, but iam stuck with this cute sonofabitch for the time being, atleast till the course ends. Iam gonna write my 4th professional after couple of months and then we( me and my sweetheart :P ) are gonna leave the hostel and find someplace else to stay so that we can prepare for PG entrance peacefully. Not my decision, HIS.
So, i suppose, i remain the same sad person till the internship ends! Or perhaps iam not sad at all. I LOVE CHASING, AND IT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING WHEN YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU ARE NEVER GONNA GET IT.</p>
<p>LOVE IS NOT BLIND. IT'S WORSE....IT DISTORTS THINGS.</p>
<p>Bytheway, thanks to admin and others who shared their valuable opinions on this. I really appreciate that. Thank you &amp; Good day!</p>
