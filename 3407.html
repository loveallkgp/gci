<p>"Hi m a straight guy 20 and I am big believer in the LGBT. More power to you guys. The world would be a nicer place if we just decided to accecpt people for who they are and not get religion culture o prejudice in between what people wanna be. </p>
<p>so there was this guy who's openly gay who I think might have fallen for me I mean he calls at odd hours of the night class me over to his place when his folks aren't around and even calls me to go with him to go to the beach (which I did at first n I don't mind talking to him since he's a very close friend of mine) but now I am worried that I'll break his heart. What do I do "</p>
<h1>gci- Make him clear as early as possible. If you keep on dragging whatever he is feeling, it will be bad for the both of you at later stage. Make him realize the reality.</h1>
