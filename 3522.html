<p>I'm 26 years old. I realized I am gay when I was in my 3'rd year of my college. I always knew that I had some sort of attraction towards boys and when I realized I'm gay it took a long time for me to come in terms with it but I eventually did. by the time I was finishing my college in the middle of some skirmishes I came out to my sister who told my parents about this and then the problems started. I could have simply stayed mum but I stood my ground. But was eventually taken to a doctor who put me under hormone replacement therapy and etcetera which put my under severe stress and depression which took me 2 years to recover and then there I fell in love with this beautiful soul in the middle of chaos. It was as soothing as it could get. But things were not going smooth as he was not out to his family because of him being the only son. We had to end our relationship somewhere after around ten months of an intense relationship due to a lot of misunderstandings. And it tool another one and half for me to recover from the breakup and I tried to meet new people but was not content with anyone. And always my mind drifts back to my Ex and compares them with him. And I find it really hard to move on because my Ex seems to have moved on. And I am starting to have a feeling that I'm not going to find anyone who will be as understanding as him. It feels like I'm gonna end up all alone and that makes my future look really scary. I can't marry a girl due to the intense pressure from the family but I'm scared because of the uncertainties I might succumb to their pressure. I am not able to leave home also as suggested by my friends due to a lot of responsibilities. What should I do? I'm really scared!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- For once, just stop listening to everyone around, whether its friends or family and listen to yourself. Everyone has a responsibility and but you first you have to mentally healthy to take care of any other person. Take a break from your life and try making career somewhere else where you could be free and live the way you want and there is no restriction and no prying eyes. You have to get out of there and see like in a total different way, YOUR WAY.</h1>
