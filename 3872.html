<p>I'm really upset with my friend! My friends to make fun of him by paring with a girl, he will just laugh and say nothing. Two days back when i joined them and made fun of him he said "You are gay" I simply managed and laughed the situation and again when my friends were doing it and I joined, he again said the same! When i asked him about it he said he simply said that for no reason. But the way he said is like he means it. Now i'm really confused! I dont know what to do and worried very much! Cant sleep or eat! Need your support and help! Help to get out of it and make it clear by your words.
Sorry for the poor my english!</p>
<h1>GCI- He is bluffing and try to get onto you. which you can clearly see the effect. But you are gay so I guess it shouldn't bother you at all.</h1>
