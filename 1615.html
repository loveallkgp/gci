<p>Hi there,
I am 30 years old and living in New Zealand for the past 5 years. I have been in long distance relationship with a guy in India. We have met just once in these 5 years. And during his stay with me, he felt as if I am not interested or in love with him. The real reason was that my parents were forcing me to get engaged and I was trying to dodge that. My mind was diverted and thinking about the future action to deal with the family pressure.
I was born in Punjabi Sikh family, and you must be aware of all the drama. I was always serious about the relationship but to be honest, never had the guts to face my family. Now, I do wanna come out but am bit scared of the consequences that it could lead to. I almost came out to my younger brother by telling him that I am never going to marry. To my surprise he never asked why. And now, I am like why he didn't he asked me for the reason.
I don't know how to come out 'coz I can put a stop to my parent's constant pressure of getting married. Every time I have had conversation with them on the phone, my marriage was always a hot topic of debate. My relatives also suggest the same. And the guy I am with still have doubts that I am not honest with him. The only thing that I am worried is that he listens to his friend's advice more than my mine. His friend and some other mutual friend were able to create problems with us. I do value and honor their friendship but sometimes I find it hard to get through to my bf.
Back to the topic, what you guys suggest. Should I come out to my parents? And if so how? Because I tried couple of times and it's like words were stuck in my throat and couldn't utter them. My brother thought the onus of getting married would shift from me to him if I do so.
I would appreciate your advice and support.
TC nd Njoy

<h1>Viv- Dear buddy, your condition is too much complicated. You have to make a mind about what do you wanna do. Can you spend your life with a girl or not? And whatever decision you make, you have to stick to it no matter what. I have 2 gay besties who are sikhs and I know very well what your condition is. You have to take a stand here. No one else is gonna come for it. Just say for now that you don't wanna get married. As far as your bf is concerned, do you think that he is the one who can come out to his parents? And can he live with you for lifetime? If so, you must have his emotional support and you while coming out introduce your parents to him. Trust me, when the burden is shared the counter effect decreases. And also, there is not much burden on you to continue the family line as you are not the only son. But honestly buddy, its your life and you have to decide how you are gonna spend it and with whom you are gonna spend it. All the best.</h1>
