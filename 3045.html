<p>Hi Admin... Love reading your reactions to the confessions...</p>
<p>I met a guy frm Planetromeo (the gay dating site)... We have been talkin for like 2 Months and I am having some feelings for him.. I dont knw wat they are.... Everytime i talk to him i feel good.. nd wen i see his message i smile.... Bt wen i said all these things to him he said that he just broke up with his bf and is not ready for ny kind of relationship again.. He says he wants to focus on his career and nothing else...And wenever i tell him to meet him (as we still have not met face to face) he avoids me and says he is busy..... I dont want to loose him as a friend (we kinda are good frnds nw)... bt den also i Want something more than friendship.... What should I do?? please tell me... Am i wasting my time (coz i feel like)..... What should I do?? </p>
<h1>GCI- Well listen, as he said that he don't want anything for now, so respect his views. He is in a place where just healthy friendship is okay. Nothing more than that. If he not flirting with you or giving any signs, then I guess you shouldn't press it either. Be his friend and don't give signals like you are all over him. Maybe that's why he is keeping distance from you. If you could just control yourself, maybe one day he will meet you.</h1>
