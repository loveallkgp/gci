<p>hey members..</p>
<p>I'm doing b.com .. and I'm tensed , going on the way of depression already.. it's about to complete of my graduation.. just few months.. and then all i have go for Job and have to manage the expenses for my further studies as my family can't support financially for further studies..
and there's no good jobs related to B.com that i could do n can get good amount..
Call centers, data entry are the only options left for me .. 
 education loan i can get but i want to persue MBA and for that i atleast need 8 lakhs.. somehow 5 lakh i can get from bank as loan .. but i can't afford those hostel, food, extra expenses..</p>
<p>in all I'm already in mess.. jitna padho to bhi kam he.. 
they said graduation will help you to get good job.. n now i realised in our country there's facilities only for those who have graduated in engineering or medical...  we b.com have no value..</p>
<p>can anyone help? suggest?</p>
<p>i can go to any big cities if i find good jobs with good amount that will be enough for my basic needs.. :/</p>
<h1>GCI- Do two more things now-</h1>
<p>1- Do a distance course of ur liking and interest.
2- Keep on applying for a govt. job and in the meanwhile earn via any means possible.</p>
