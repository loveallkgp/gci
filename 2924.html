<p>Hey admin u do a great job by guiding us and helping us out. Infact most of us are inspired by you. U know everything in this world and are really awesome. You are a role model for all gays and bi and trans. You are very good and helpful. You are also knowledgeable and witty. Infact I have never ever seen or heard of anyone as wise and mature as u. You give us courage to accept our reality and make us proud of what we are. Infact after your suggestions I got the courage to tell everyone the truth. Pls tell me if you are also open abt ur gayness wid family n friends??</p>
<h1>GCI : thank you :) . as per my family .. they have seen me growing up as a kid . i have dressed in girls clothes :P ..they never stopped me . .. but with time i stopped it as i got to know about gender roles , but my parents never stopped me .</h1>
<p>my friends with whom i have shared a journey from nursery ... they aren't unaware of me possessing gayness ' . i am not out to anybody yet but even a blind person can tell i am gay . it won't shock many when i will  come out as they secretely know it already . :)</p>
