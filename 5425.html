<h1>GCI- What you can do is not force yourself upon him. You cannot force love on anyone. You tried it, he didn't agree, just move on. You cannot do anything more about it. If he is straight there is no future possible with him. If he is gay, he is in denial and will only hurt you more in future. Find someone who is more confident about himself.</h1>
