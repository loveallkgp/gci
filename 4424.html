i dont want to lose a friend like him...&amp; i also cannot leave my boo...
What shall i do u guys...???</p>
<h1>GCI- It is a clear cut situation in which you should keep your friends and romance separated. You should apologize your friend and say that it should never happen again(if you really love your bf). Also, if you don't feel for your friend, then its no use of him to try something with you.</h1>
