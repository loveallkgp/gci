<p>Well guys m here just share my story which ended very sadly... I am bisex and m strong just like any other straight guys like to play soccer goes crazy for soccer...here's my story I met this guy from nepal through online in a chatting room...we started chatting very often and slowly I was in deep love with him we exchange our number and he call me up sometimes back then I spend a lot of my money calling him everyday as it was international calls. Gradually my love for him grew so fast that I even decided to visit him. I visited him during the month of may 2013, finally we saw each other face to face, the moment I saw him I was filled with joy, I am mascular guy and tuff as I hit the gym a lot. But he was slim fair with the look of that chinese or japanese perhaps but in one word he was very cute, I stayed in his house and made love the whole time we will sleep naked and cuddle each other I felt so lucky to find such a sweet guy, I stayed there for one week and when the time came for me leave I was so sad, and on june I visited him again but this time he was changed he will not let me kiss him or hold his had he was completely a different person. I felt so broken and shattered, just for him I did so much and at last what I get is he turning away from me...I left that place and swear never to visit again or trust on anyone so easily... So friends I will like to suggest u all that trust people but don't trust them so much that u won't even know what is wrong and what is right....</p>
<h1>GCI- This is why you should have a set of rules before you set out to find someone. Get in a relation too soon will have negative effects in most of the relations. Atleast give it a time of more than 3 months to get emotionally involved and have sex even later. It can save you from a lot of trouble.</h1>
