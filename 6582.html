<p>hello GCI</p>
<p>so here's my story !
is it wrong to date own relative?
I'm dating my own relative(Kaku ka beta)
i stay alone near by clg for studies ..
we had fight/ disputes 4 years ago for properties and all. ( my parents n family with kaku n kaki n their family? we used to stay at another state from my childhood.. but 4 yeara ago we came back as dad retired from his job n we decided to stay in our own house ( not our own but grandfather ka n he's no more) n jhagra hua for that thing.. from that time both family stays apart from each other miles away.. don't talk to each other.. now its kinda enemy type relations..</p>
<p>but months ago i found a guy on PR.. we started talking to each other .... we did chat for 2-3 months without sharing pics n number... dont know why but its weird thing even i think that we both didnt ask pics n number for 3 months n continued chating.. but one day he said let's meet.. then i thought n asked his pic..
but he said a great line " dekh 3 months tak without dekhe bina baat kar rahe he n we have become so good friend also.. mere taraf se toh genuine feelings he.. tere taraf se kya he pata nahi.. tu jesa bhi he mujhe koi problems nhi he kyu ki teko dekhe bina hi tere se dosti hogai he .. so dekh ne k baad dosti khattam nhi hogi mere taraf se.. baaki milke tujhe me acha nahi laga ya dosti nhi karni he to bata dena.. uske liye bhi koi problems nhi he.. but let's do a blind date"..</p>
<p>mene socha ye sunne k baad...
then somehow i was convinced by myself to be genuine guy.. so me bhi without showing pics.. milne gaya..</p>
<p>then mujhe mera hi bhai mila .
( well we both know each other's sexuality bcoz we used to share same bed sometimes years ago when i used to come to his place . n cozy moments hojate the sote waqt)
uss time toh we both were silent for minutes.. how to start a conversation we both didnt knw .. but slowly slowly thik hogaya sab..</p>
<p>it has been 6 months from that time
n now wo mere ghar pe roz ata he.. his clg is near by my house too..</p>
<p>we became friends from brother .... we had sex too..</p>
<p>but a week ago he said let's get committed to each other.. mene kuch bola nahi but just smiled ..but i do love him ..</p>
<p>but we're siblings.. sex is okay coz we both are comfortable with it..
but he's saying let's get committed n we'll try to get to go to USA after that we'll stay together n shaadi karenge and all... uska Visa hogaya he USA ka .. n mera bhi hone wala he ..</p>
<p>i love him very much... but shaadi waadhi.. future n family k bareme soch kar dar jata hu.... the main thing.. both our family don't even know that we both talk to each other...</p>
<p>its secret.. ab me kya karu yaar.. its sure that we'll be in USA very soon.. but waha jakar baat aur jyada serious hogaya toh? yaar kya karu me .. koi batao!</p>
<h1>GCI- What's holding you back? Is it the fear of incest? If you love him, then why there is any fear? Do not think about people. You both are consenting adults and no one can morally guide you to not do something. If you think you both can have a good life together, then by all means go for it.</h1>
