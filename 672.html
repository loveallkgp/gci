<p>hi, mumbai here
In my pervious confession I told about my frind who is divose and I confess him tht I love him..and after tht he told me tht "talk to me properly"...and after admin's advice...i started talking to him normally as a frind only and kept safe distance from him...if he message thn only i reply.... after doing all this stuff I notice one thing tht he was observing my whts app continusly....if i m online for long time he ask me..."kiske saath baat kar raha hai??" he wish me GM and GN with out fail and in between he alwys ask...."had dinner? kay kar raha hai? kaha hai???" sometimes I avoide to reply...becoz to keep distance...becoz no hopes for relation....
becoz of his behaviour i m confuse now...whts going on in his mind......plz advice???</p>
<h1>Viv- Haha.. uske dimag ke gears ghoomne shuru ho gaye hain. He is going like, "This guy is gay and he is in love with me but why the hell he is not texting me?" Usko ego ki baat aa gayi hai ab. This is what going on in his mind. You just keep on what you are doing. Be his friend only. If he would feel anything for you, let him make the first move.</h1>
