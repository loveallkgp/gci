<p>Hey guys I m Adi... 22 yrs old from Delhi... I wanna tell u something which happended last night ( 12 July'15 )... there was this guy from punjab whom i started talking just 2 weeks ago... a nice working chap... with a different thinking n attitude... which i liked... n yeah initially i started liking this guy but after few days i stopped thinking of any mingle between us as he was against it... what i got to know from his words... he was alltoghter something different... His words were so different... he was not like those usual Top n Btm fcking assholes... or baby i lov u so much... or tum kaha se ho.. kaha rehte ho kinda bio data collectors... he was moreover an intellectual... debator kinda... with prefect english... who always said something which was knowledge... which fascinated me to chat with him... which was way better to talk about sex n its realted shit like others... We used to talk every evening as both of us are working... but there was a difference in between us... i was like east n he was like west... we both had different thinking... n he used to say that he dosn't know why we both talked coz we both never agree on a single thing... but i felt that was the most superb thing... kinda challenging n fun too... n he liked it too... i know that But last night he told me about his past... about what all he faced... his bad times... n i pointed it out that whatever happended in his life... even he made faults...he shouldn't hav been so dominated... which he didn't liked... i know i said it like a friend so that he dosn't repeat it again... but he didn't liked it... n then he started talking about me... like i m crazy n a free bird... who dosn't care... which i think he said it coz he has suffered a lot in life... n i might hav offended him... which i regret... then after that i straight away logged out in anger... n this morning when i logged in again he was gone... be wrote a very long msg... that he going forever n blocked his id... n said its better to stay away from all this gay world... damn... its like i got a heart attack... i don't know... what to say further... i felt like i had a connection with him... i considered him as a good friend that i always needed... but its over... i don't hav any of his contact... i don't know where to search for him... even if i pray to god to bring him back... don't know he will or not... At last I'll only say... when u r conserving with the people whom u consider to be close to u... always TC of ur words... think before u speak or even write !!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Well not to disrespect him and whatever he went through(we all went through really really tough times in life. If i was anything like him, I would have taken that decision long time ago and wouldn't be here even), he would be back here. He definitely would be.</h1>
