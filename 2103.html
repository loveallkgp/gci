<p>Hi guys I'm a straight looking guy and I'm a gay. I want to share one incident of my life with you guys. Once I was going through a metro train in Delhi. And it was rush in the train. Suddenly a 35 yr old (approximately) uncle came near to me and started trying to touch my dick and trying to hold it. I ignored him but he didn't stopped doing this. Then I moved away from him but he followed me and came running after me and started telling his name. Guys I was very much in shock when he held my hand in public and I had no idea about him that who the hell is he. Firstly I tried to ignore him completely but he was very much after me so I had to give response to him. I told him dude plz don't follow me but still he was insisted. So I had no alternate to run away from that place and I did that. I have shared this with u guys bcz I want to know if something like this ever happened with anyone of u??? Or I'm the only one who had to face such a situation. Plz give ur comments truly.</p>
<h1>GCI- A person tried to touch me in a bus while I was going to my college around 2 years back but I quickly got down shoving him aside. It scared the shit out of me. Log literally kahi bhi shuru ho jaate hain.</h1>
