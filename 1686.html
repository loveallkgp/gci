<h1>Viv- Why are you putting the blame on him? You cheated on him in the first place and when he found out the truth, instead of feeling sorry you are blaming him for stalking? Right. Real mature you are. You are nothing but a coward who was not able to handle the situation. And you fell in love with a second guy after having sex while you were still in a relation? Tell me how do you even deserve a true partner?</h1>
