<p>"I'm a romantic at heart and love to show it. My bf and I met each other on fb almost a year back, but the relationship got serious only 52 days ago. I want him to take me out for a movie, a coffee or at least a walk on the beach. But he rarely takes me out just thrice till now, I understand his work keeps him busy. I love for our clothes to be colour coordinated like matching green or red tees when I go out with him, he intially agreed but never wears saying some reason or other- it was dirty, it became tight, I forgot, etc..  He also has the irritating habit of wearing his jeans very low, so that his Jockey is seen. I told him, but he never listens. 
Our thoughts and ideas were very similar that's why i committed to him, but now I'm having serious doubts. Am I stressing over silly things?"</p>
<h1>gci- Yes honey you are indeed stressing over silly things. You can't force things upon him that he doesn't like. Let these things come in him naturally. If you force him he might feel suffocated and he will go away.</h1>
