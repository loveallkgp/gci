<h1>Viv- Did my brain cells just die? I think they did. Anyways, its totally upon you when to become physical with your bf. No one can force you for it. And as he is understanding sure you got a nice one. But SEX(not shit -_- ) is not a sin. If you think sex before marriage is a sin then getting committed is also a sin. Be liberal buddy.</h1>
