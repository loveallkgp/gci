<p>hi... i wanna make confession this is my first time.
i m from south India, where homosexuality is still a crime...nevertheless that never stops anyone from searching for what they want in "www.com". The morass of dating websites eases off their search. the difference being its mostly for getting to know each others manhood than themselves... I wanna date some one. I thought dating websites were worth a shot.... but all i got was request for sex...i am seriously vexed... i literally deleted all my accounts. all i wanted was a guy who irritates me d most and yet makes me d most happiest person on the earth. someone to take me to my extremes and yet make me feel alive. someone to hold hands and walk, someone to push away and yet tackle his chest, someone to hug in night and someone to wake up next day in the morning. but all i can find is people craving for pleasure. not even ready to meet up for a coffee.all they say is ""I have place, u wanna come?" i seriously gave up... all the PRINCE CHARMING CRAP IS FICTIONAL. IN REALITY IT STRIKES HARD AS THEY DO NOT EXIST.... i just wanted to relieve whatever i felt... so i confessed here</p>
