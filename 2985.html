<p>I was in open relation with a guy for about 3 months and we tried evrything like blowjob biting. Few weeks after breakup I learnt from another friend that he had aids and had hidden it from me. When i called him he confirmed and said dont worry we always used condoms. I was scared like hell and cried daily till my results came negative. The doctor told me i was lucky to be alive and must give up gay life and get married. He said over 90 percent of gays have aids and other std. I now never meet gays and just have phone sex..hope to get married soon</p>
<h1>GCI- See let me give you a glimpse of future. You will get married, settle down but then you desires will kick in and you will search for a guy and you will get laid with him in whatever for he may come. Sure you want that? Also, its not a bad thing to be careful you shouldn't be scared over a fake fact that 90% of gays have aids. Aids happen to those who have multiple sex partners and that too without condoms. So you be sure to have protected sex. At the end, you getting married to a woman will be just like aids. It will eat you up from the inside and there ain't no protection for it.</h1>
