<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I want to tell you all through which I had gone in a relation of two years. Even today, I am unable to come up with the reason why I am all alone even after so much of love and care! I am writing what is coming in my mind one by one. This post might be long and boring enough to read. But please read it once.</p>
<p>It was 24 March 2012. A usual day of a teenager from Lucknow. I was online of facebook and suddenly I got a msg from a person whom I nver talked before. It was a usual chat. Rahul (changed name) told me that he is 26 and doing job. I was looking for some gud frndz over there. I find him gud and our conversation carried on. We started talking daily. In a week we become gud frndz and decided to meet in Hazratganj. It was indeed a beautiful evening of my life. I was feeling blessed. We started meeting often and and after three months we decided to go in relationship and I just cannot tell wat was the limit of my love for him. </p>
<p>Well for a month things were on track. But afterwards I noticed that his attention towards me was getting lesser. Whenever I called him, he used to busy and whenever he picked my call, we hardly talked for more than 5 mins. He always used to say that he is busy in some work or the other. But I never said anything to him. Becoz I was sure that he loves me and he might be busy. Things were getting worst day by day. We decided to meet at 6pm. I reached there in time. I kept waiting for him for two hours. I called on his cell bt no reply. He came at 8pm. I was lil angry yet I said nothing bt 'its ok'. Now it became his habit of not picking my call and coming late. But I was fool enough to think that he remains busy in work at home becoz his mom was not able to walk properly. He was getting careless day by day for me. Inspite of all these things, I never give up. I always did something special for him to make him realize how much I love him. </p>
<p>I used to say to him that he will get married soon and I will be left all alone. And he always said just two words-"No, never." I always said to him to spend those days in best way we can becoz we never know when he would get married and would be the circumstances at that time. But he always claimed that he cannot do that right now becoz he was at home and in studies. Every time he broke my heart and I kept on picking up those broken pieces to move ahead with him. 
I asked him one day that "Ashiqui 2" is a beautiful movie, lets go to watch but he denied. You people wont believe, We didn't was a single movie together. :(</p>
<p>My bday came but he didnt come for a second to meet me for he was very busy in his exams preparation. I cried and cried but he didnt come. Like this.. christmas, new year, valentine passed, bt we didnt celebrate even a single moment together. Ya we can meet only whenever he  was free.. nothing else ever mattered to him. Finally! its was the month of May 2013 when I came to know that he is going to marry. I cried like hell hiding from him. Many of you can understand what I was feeling at that moment. But he didn't come once to wipe my tears. Well I made myself strong and decided that I wont let him feel down becoz of me as it would be one of the most beautiful moment of his life. He was going to be engaged on 11 August. A few days back I called him but he didn't pick my call. I was feeling very down. I was calling and calling but he didn't pick. Whole day passed and he picked my call at 7pm in the evening and started shouting when I asked where he was. He shouted like hell and I was doing nothing but listening to wat he was saying. :(</p>
<p>That day, finally I decided to go out of his life. Not becoz he was getting angry but becoz I was unable to understand wat he wanted :'(
I was doing everything for him, everything to see him happy and he behaved like that. He was not having the thought that I would have been feeling.</p>
<p>I completely got out of his life. He called, he messaged.. but i didnt respond. Like this around 5 months passed and the month of November came. I knew the date of his marriage. A three days before his marriage he called me again with a new number. I picked up the call and hearing his voice I was about put down the call but he said,"You swear your love" and I could not do anything. He asked me to attend his marriage. I denied so he called my mom and asked her. My mom asked to go and I had to go. I was showing anger but my God knew how much I loved him. I reached there a day before his marriage. I took part in every ritual to see him smiling. I danced. I did everything thinking that may be now he would understand that how much I love him. I never ever thought that I would smile like that on his marriage. But it was my love that was forcing me to do that. Many a times I feel like crying and cried too whenever I was alone. But infornt of him, I was ready with a smiling face always. In this way I stood with him till the last ritual of marriage and came back home. I was depressed becoz he was not mine then and happy too becoz I was feeling that he would now change himself becoz he had seen me.. my love.. everything. </p>
<p>But unfortunately, nothing like that happened. He got married in the last week of November 2013 and its October 2014 but he never contacted me back. I called him many a times but all went in vain. He blocked me everywhere. And now I am unable to guess a single reason why he did this to me. I loved him like he was my prince. I used to give him a love letter on 24th of each month. It was I who used to stay awake whenevr he felt down. I didn't say a word watever he did with me still............... Wat I should have done so that he would have been with me even today. Even right now m crying remembering those moments. Does he never think about me? I lost everything! :( :'( :'(</p>
<h1>GCI- You didn't loose anything, embed this in your head. He made a massive mistake by ignoring you. Why does only the right guys get the wrong partner?</h1>
<p>And you! Stop contacting him! I know that it was your love and all but when you don't get the respect you require you have to get it and you were looking for it in the wrong place. It was is loss that he ignored an amazing partner like you. You did possibly everything you could and he never cared for it, All of it tells that he has no care for human feelings, and you do not want to spend your life with a person so inhumane. Trust me, you are better off without him. Get out of it. You definitely deserve someone way way wayyy a thousand times better. May the peace be with you.</p>
