<p>To the person who posted my confession #5933
Like I said in my last confession, 'you can assume things about me but they would be just mere assumptions.'</p>
<p>You're a hypocrite! You're anasshole!</p>
<p>You judge people, people whom you don't even know. Yeah, weirdos like me do exist in this world and I'm glad that I'm the one who introduced this new weird world to you.</p>
<p>It wasn't that offensive but YOU don't know ME buddy. You don't know who I'm, what do I do, what I'm going through. You know nothing.</p>
<p>I hope, you try not to be an asshole anymore.</p>
<p>The 'weird' and the 'insecure' guy.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, the other admin may have written something that you didn't like. But ask yourself something, you say you want to change, yet you don't want to get changed. You make friends, be with them for some time and then you leave them. And then you say that you are not close to anyone to have a meaningful conversation. Do you not think that you should give a person some time to reach a particular level of friendship? Your thoughts are contradicting your needs. The admin said that you need a deeper psychological understanding of what you want, did you read that? You just took one word "weirdo" and stuck to that.</h1>
<p>Anyway, you came here with 1% of you life and asked for a particular situation, other people are gonna assume stuff to reason around it. Yet again you say that we can assume the stuff and they would be just assumptions. Why do you ask for suggestions if you don't want to hear them? </p>
<p>PS- If you know the problem and the solution, you yourself can work on it alone. You cannot just dangle in the limbo and imagine the change happening.</p>
