<p>hello everyone i m 17 this is not a confession bt i wanna talk abt a person who has inspired me so much in my life his name is tyler oakley hez a vry famous youtuber frm america he came out at the age of 13 today hez 25 n a gay icon i hav been
watching his videos since past many years n if tyler wouldnt hav been there i would hav been very scared today with the idea of me being gay bt now it just seems a small part of my life on his birthday he collected 500 thousand dollars for the trevor project for those who dont knoe what trevor project is ,google it bitch !
all i wanna sae to my fellow teen frnds is that if u r feeling lonely or scared or anything like that u shld may b watch him it just kind off makes me happy may be it will make u too also hez the happiest gay person i hav seen in my life
admin do u watch tyler cos i guess u were talking abt miranda sings in one of ur comments when.u said HATERS BACK OFF lol xd </p>
<h1>GCI- Tyler is her bae and Miranda is my bae. My squinchy squinchy bae! <em>I am smiling like her</em></h1>
<p>I watch his videos and yes he can be inspiring but I am not that big of a follower of him. I like his collabs with Connor more. I mostly like Superwoman and Miranda Sings. As for any gay inspiration, I love Shane Bitney Crone. He is the perfect idol for me.</p>
