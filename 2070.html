<p>Hi guys,
I was very disturbed after reading the comments for confession #2051. What f**k guys? Can anyone of you change who you are? You can't change the fact that you are gay. Being effeminate is a person's nature. They can't change it on their own.
To me it seems more like asking a gay guy to get married to please this world. It's very difficult to live in this world if you are gay and on top of that effeminate. But you can't change it. Would you like to dye your hair brown or blonde just to be a part of this "Creepy World"? I won't.
And for Heavens sake please don't associate effeminate and bottoms. A top can be effiminate and a bottom can be a muscular hunk. Stop stereotyping. You know why LGBT flag is a rainbow? So that it covers all the sexual minorities not just the so called "TOPS" and "BOTTOMS".
Those who are gonna accept you, they will accept you the way you are. And those who won't, they won't accept you even if can turn this world upside down. </p>
<h1>GCI- Did people really say to change the behavior? Damn! Why can make people change their mentality and let the accept everyone as they are? Instead the person in question is targeted again and again. Great effing efforts.</h1>
