<p>Counsellar-Hmm well I would like to encourage you with one thing.I would want you to have sexual encounter with a female.And then differentiate dear ,you will know the difference. See what you feel for men is subconsciously saved in your mind,that its suppose to be that way so you are not feeling attracted to a female But you can try being sexually active with a female and then you will probably know the difference</p>
<p>Me-No no plzzz I dnt want to do it. I dnt want to disrespect my feelings and my body. I dnt want fall from my eyes.</p>
<p>She-and then you can finally understand your sexual orientation.you won't be falling.rather you may be thankful because there is something that is natural</p>
<p>Me-If some one tell u to attract towards girl how u feel 
She-But then that would be unnatural right. because ...reproduction happens when a male and female come in contact and share that special bond.</p>
<p>Me-I know so many people who r gays or bi and married to girl and still meeting guys for tht pleasure</p>
<p>She-Yes..I know
    its happening..but then you know there may be some guys who realize
    that gay sex is not natural
could be right.Yes you are right when you said that there are many gay men married. or are bisexual
and you have relationshipsso why are you not at peace  You should be peaceful If you are in the right place and doing the right thing
I want you to be an explorer.because influencing is one thing..but learning that for self is a different thing.</p>
<p>Me-But I sacred about my future I dnt know wht god has written on my destiny</p>
<p>She -Hmm , if what you believe and doing is right then you shouldn't be scared about your future
Its hard for you to fall for a girl because you don't have feeling for female
and the reason is you never gave yourself the opportunity to explore with a female</p>
<p>that many at times our experiences or abuses in the childhood dictate who we are in the adulthood</p>
<p>Me-Some gays go to call girl spend one night with them and still they r gays</p>
<p>Hmm because there are illogical and irrational belief system stuck in subconscious mind.</p>
<h1>GCI- Guurrrrll, who dis bish? Imma take my earrings out and beat her with my 6 inch heels! Why is she even a counsellor? Her practice is outdated and she should stop and have sex with her husband.</h1>
<p>Starting from point 1: The subconscious feelings for men in your mind has overpowered the everyday life where you see 99% heterosexual couples in in tv shows, movies, at work or at school. Very logical.</p>
<p>Point 2: Why every person who is against homosexuality, brings the topic of unnatural gay sex? The term itself is very vague and means nothing. She says that natural sex leads to reproduction. What about the hetero couples that cannot reproduce? This is just one meaningless argument when they have nothing. Tell her to get effed up in the bum and she will see the nature in her mind.</p>
<p>Point 3: She can give herself an opportunity to fall in love with a shark fish because her dad never gave her the permission to go out. See childhood trauma of being left out of amazing things in life. I've heard that sharks are excellent kissers.</p>
