<p>dear admin can u plz tell me about origin of homosexuality n how can i controll my self to attract towards my closefriends......bcoz its rlly dffcult to controll my self whn i am with those hot guys ama loose character i dont knw...</p>
<h1>GCI- Origin of homosexuality? I don't think that some guy in the history was poked in his ass by a unicorn's horn and when he made babies, the homosexuals came into existence.</h1>
<p>It has been here ever since the evolution of life on earth and has been passed down through genes from the ancestors. </p>
<p>To control yourself from your attraction towards your friends, just think that you have to have a non-sexual friendship with them. Its not a loose character thing to get attracted or to get aroused. Loose character is when you go to a party for 50 times in a month, get high on drugs and booze and then wake up not knowing where you are, in a washroom of a club or on the bed of a stranger, not knowing who had sex with you everytime. That's loose memory and loose character. So chill and spread love.</p>
