<p>ok... this is not a confession but a serious matter which i wud like to bring it to ur notice guys..
b4 starting, i myself is a gay n m proud being a gay..
so yesterday me, my uncle , aunt n my cousin sisters went on a beach fr an evening walk.
as we wer walking, i saw 3 guys laughing n giggling... by looking at them any one cud make out that they ver girlish gays(no offence).
so when we passed them suddenly we heard them whistleing n passing sm weird comments on me. like "eyy handsome, wat a body yaar.. kaash muje mile raat bhar..meri toh nikal padi" such disgusting n cheap comments wer passed on me which my family also heard.
hearing all this my aunt went n started arguing with them.. to which one guy replied "ey aunty kabi gays nahi dekhe kya??? jab tere ladka gay hoga na tab tuje pata chalega"</p>
<p>this is wat such cheap gays potray LGBT as? even i m gay and i wud hv nvr been such cheap to pass such humiliating comments...
those words ver so hard that they poke my aunt deep that she got emotionally unbalanced and started crying...</p>
<p>guys plz dont do such things where our society is portrayed as cheap n sex freaks...
n for those who do such cheap things : straights/guys are not meals to quench ur carnal desires..</p>
<h1>GCI- Well that is seriously disgusting. They have their version of being gay. Lets not be judgmental towards them. Maybe they were having just fun or maybe they are like that only. Anyways, one day or the other they will see sense. The behavior was really cheap nevertheless. One should not really impose their behavior as the generalized one.</h1>
