<p>actually this is not a confession, just about how i am spending time..i would be happy if admins say something about this</p>
<p>my father told me that instead of sitting ideal, i should go and work somewhere in these school summer vacations, so i decided to find work and got work, where?...in a wig industry. i must say that it is the most silent industry, we just have to sit on chair and plant every strand of hair on toupee to make wigs, it requires lot of concentration and time and pay's good. there is another section in industry where doctors and sit and examine those bald men to see which wig will suit them best. they also send me to do some surveys and i can take any friend with me( and he too gets some money from company for helping me) and we count the number of bald men in those neighborhoods... but we don't know for such little and easy work , why they provide better salary??, my friend told me that this industry get lots of profit and they have their own hair saloons to collect more hair and from there they receive tremendous profit and then they make wigs and sell it which adds more to their profits and they have so much money that they don't know what to do with it and so that's why they send workers to do some surveys. they also collect hair from various countries, so if someone wears a wig, it's probably the hair of some Japanese men or Indonesian women .
plus you know, no one can stop wearing wigs, it becomes an addiction, after every 2 years people are forced to buy wigs, like if a person who uses wig can't go to office without wigs, they have to buy otherwise what will they say to their seniors and juniors?</p>
<p>i think people wear wigs because when there hair goes bald, they feel that their bodies are wearing away or a part of their body is dead, so to look lively, they get addicted to such things.</p>
<p>so viv and abhy , will you ever use wigs when you will be bald?</p>
<h1>Viv- Hain? Bhagwaan kare aisi naubat hi na aaye ki main wig pehnu.</h1>
