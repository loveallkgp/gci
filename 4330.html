<p>So the other day at work during lunch, i was casually checking out(or rather just looking at) a familiar face who was eating in the next table. She was beautiful, just that I am not attracted to her. My friends noticed it and started teasing me. They simply have no idea. Sometimes I just wanna tell them. They seem okay with gay relationships as it is occasionally a topic in our lunch talks including human rights in general. But I can't imagine what they will think when their own friend is one, they may not be as accepting as when it's just a topic of some random chats. I am sure there are many of you facing the same. How do you deal with this??</p>
<h1>GCI- Well it is indeed a very good point, you know. People can speak about equality and all openly but sometimes their behavior change when someone close to them comes out. But you may never know. They can fully support you if you tell them.</h1>
