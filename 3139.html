<p>hello to everyone..actually im in a relationship with a married male.. I had never seen him live but have seen his pics n on skype too..now I think its about 9 month of our relation..we regular have phone calls and skype calls..he is very honest and shows his true love for me everytime..he has never forced me to have a face to face conversation ..he says when you will have a complete trust on me then you can visit me but im all time always ready for you.... main problem is previously I didnt took d matter so seriously as I was enjoying my first love life but now internally I develop bitter feelings when he talks about his wife n kids...damn why like dat??? he on d first day told me that he was married but I accepted him as Im on mature males n I told him that ill not create any problem related to ur family life...but now I cant imagine him with anyone else..i want him completely...whats happening and why this is happening to me??? I cant think of a single day without listening his voice...help me what should I do further....n im 100% sure that his love for me is soooooo reallll... </p>
<h1>GCI- Imaging you are married and someone else is trying to get with your partner. How healthy is that? You lead yourself in this situation and then you ask "whats happening?" He has a wife. Was that not enough to take a step away from him? Think practically</h1>
