<p>21 male. I look men when they at look me from top to bottom. But those are gay people?. Well i m starting my worst come worst story in my life. I had a felling on my classmate he is good and lovely guy. So wat i did i calld him to a temple and i explained my fellings. But he told me abt his xlover whr she died in accident so i asked him can i fill her place in ur heart. He asked me time for one day so i gaven to him. Two days gone and three days gone he s not properly attending the classes so i felt sad. he arrived to college after few days and i talked to him wat s ur opinion he told me that he dont like homosexual so he started avoiding me and he is still loving her xlove. After this incident i become weak which i couldnt conc on my project and started smoking and drinking. He explained to all my college friends abt this. I felt sad abt this i become lonely in my class and i dont know how this matter got to my brother but he is also stopped talking to me. My bro warned me to not to talk to him... I become lonely and all in night times i cry like a child. Guys my suggestion s not to keep any felling on any one who is not a homo. Still i love him after he doing these things. He still look at me like he is missing someone. I dont know what is thr in his mind.

<p>**admin_abby : look darling you are gay and its a beautiful thing . be fabulous and don't take your classmastes ignorance as granted . don't do drugs , they make you look horrible and i don't want any gay boy look horrible. i mean you aren't supposed stop living if some small mind people ignore you . go study ... you need bright future so that people can have example ' gays ' can lead a normal life and can set a good example to people. see drugs are going to do nothing good in your love life or career or emotions. be strong , go talk to your brother openly ( only if he is well behaved and understanding person ) . and about that guy you like .. please !!! stay away from him .... forget him ... how he has bitched about isn't a deed of good person . you are just attracted thats all ..  at this age these temporary feelings happen ..  be humble, be focused , do good in studies ... right people will come talk to you ..</p>
