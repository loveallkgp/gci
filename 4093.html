<p>Hey Guys,
How you all doing?
I am have a confession to make. I am a gay guy and pretend to be straight. Let me state by saying that I never felt safe and comfortable in my skin because of the society. I always felt that I am less of a man. To compensate this loss, I became more religious. All this started way before I realized the fact that I am actually a gay. I blamed my sexual abuse that "MADE ME GAY". But few years back I discovered the some signs that point in the direction of me being gay before the abuse. I had a huge inferiority complex. And you could say that at one stage I was a total lost cause.
Talking about today, I am well settled with good earning job. I am going to come out to my family by the end of this year. Only thing I want to tell other guys like me, who feel that they are the only one, that you are not alone. Just hang in there and hold tight. Even in times of turbulence there's always hope. Life can change.
Thanks all. Love
Singh</p>
