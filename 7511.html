<h1>7503 continued... well I asked him about getting into relationship and what he thinks.. he said he has feelings for me but he wants me to be his brother first and then anything else.. and when I asked do u want to be in relationship .. he said yes.. we speak to each other daily.. we r not gays .. we r bisexuals.. then he said.. what about our life after marriage.. I said we anyways had to marry and we would obviously carry on our relationship after that .. he said that would be hard n sort of break up only .. I said it would be anyway..  he is coming to my town in few days.. so I need suggestions.. should I propose him? Because either of us cannot stay without each other.. he gets boner by my voice.. we exchange pics almost whole day.. we send our nude vdos n pics.. please suggest n help...</h1>
<h1>GCI- This is so weird. He wants to be your brother, want to be in a relationship, he gets horny, he will get married but will continue it after that too, what do you wanna propose for? To keep the fuck alive forever? Nah.. that is just too cheesy for you.</h1>
