<p>Hello admin and all my dear friends, hope you all are well.I am Arijit.I am transexual but I say that I am gay because there are many eaducated illiterate people who will ask " do you have boobs", "do you have vigiana" etc. bullshit and I hate giveing this kind of explainations. I am happy with the tag of 'girly gay' even I don't mind being called a chakka or hijra (I think they are better than many of us and I respect them).Soon I am planning to go for a sex change but my doctors are not giving me a green signal because of a few complications.I don't even mind being a guy. My family supports me a lot and most importantly they respect my sexuality. I am like this(girly) since my childhood, I can't recall any perticular time when I can say I suddenly started feeling for guys. It was a very slow process which was never curbed by my parents or the society in which I was living.I was gangraped by a few guys(I dont know them, cant recgonise them and even dont remember the cab no. of that taxi) but I can't teach them a lesson. I was depressed a bit after this incedent took place but now I am totally ok.Nowadays persuing a jewellery designing course after leaving my engg. course.
"My family has supported me through all stages",it dosent mean my life was easy.I also faced bullies, homophobes and people who are jealous of me( I was one among the top students of my school and this was enough to create lots of bitchy rivals.) I always fought back to them,I standed for myself and others like me.I am very good at handeling bullies, they want drama and I give them the better than they expect.
I am girly,I love my makeup, I do wear red lipstick sometimes. I fearlessly wear so called girly colours.I love wearing hot pants.I love pink.My dear friends don't panic this is also an avatar of a boy.Guys like me also exist.
By saying all this I don't want say that I am a very nice person.I do have flaws.
Thankyou and goodluck.I will tell you all about my flaws next time if admin allows.</p>
<p>Hi friends. I am Arijit Biswas coming to my flaws. I am a very mean and selfish person. I am over ambitious, I can go to any extent for sucess. I am a attention seeker. I behave like a bitch sometimes. I know you all are going to call me names, a drama queen etc but I don't care. Hero ya heroine ka toh pata nahi lekin I am the vamp of every(atleast most) story of my life.
Most of the times we see a person is either potryed as a hero or saint otherwise he is the villain in most of the movies , novels etc. but
I belive the real person is inbetween these two extrems.</p>
<p>Please attach both parts of my confessions. If you have time you can edit a little I don't mind even if you cant(I know you dont have time). Thankyou! Goodluck </p>
<h1>GCI- When I was reading the confession, Lady Gaga's Donatella was going on in my head. It goes like-</h1>
<p>I am so fab
Check out,
I'm blonde,
I'm skinny,
I'm rich,
and I'm a little bit of a bitch :p</p>
<p>Anyways, just a personal opinion, do not make that decision which you will regret later. First be sure that you wanna have a sex change and you will be comfortable with it because it is a big big decision. Like 180 degree shift. All the best.</p>
