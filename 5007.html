<p>Hey GCI</p>
<p>I have been a frequent visitor since last week and it's amazing what we all have here. Admin, i know you hear it a lot but you are doing an amazing job, taking about time in today's hectic n busy life is one of the most precious thing you can give someone. Your sarcasm n your non judgemental comments make it all the more interesting to read the confessions.</p>
<p>Jhaffiya te pappiya for you</p>
<p>Its not a confession neither do I want any advice but i just want to ask you and take all of ur opinion as to what do you think happened between us.</p>
<p>Its was 6 months ago when i (24) met this guy (30) on PR from overseas. He was simply perfect, exactly how i wanted my partner to be, mature, well read, understanding, non judgemental and very supportive. And then i did something stupid, I fell for him and confessed it to him. He said he has too much to chew right now and can't commit to anything, until he resolves his issues, to which i agreed and it felt appropriate as well. His issues were that he was engaged to someone and wanted to untie the knot which he had forcefully tied because of parental pressure, it was a very difficult time for him, he was petrified about his life since he was already 30 and din know about what to do about this marriage thing for which his parents kept pushing him. I was there with him all the time helped him emotionally supported him and told him to clearly refuse for marriage and to live for himself. Fortunately, they called off the wedding and everything was fine now. Meanwhile he kept talking to me texting me, we exchanged romantic poetry very often and talked about our dreams and future. one day, before his wedding was called off he said " i think there could be an US"
I was incredibly happy to hear those words. So we started to talk more intensely and passionately, after two weeks from when his wedding got cancelled. I asked him again, "now that everything is settled down what do you think", he kept quiet for a few seconds n spoke " i dont know, i am 30 and i still haven't figured out a lot of things in my life. lets meet before we decide anything" and asked me to wait for another 6-10 months time to which i refused saying that its like being stuck in the giant wheel all by yourself and told him to take a decision as it was already 5 months now to which he din reply.
We haven't spoken since then. i texted him a couple of times to which he din reply. I was literally shattered and felt miserable. Whenever i thought of him which was very frequent i felt terrible sensation in my tummy and it got difficult for me to breath.</p>
<p>Its been a month since that last conversation he still hasn't tried to talk to me. I am over him (i guess) but sometimes i wonder that someone who meant the world to me for whom i was there whenever he needed me i meant nothing. Am i that worthless and was my love that insignificant.</p>
<p>HE WAS THE INK THAT FLOWED IN MY VERSE
HE WAS MORE THAN INK, MORE THAN VERSE.</p>
