<p>Hi...
I don't know...people dont like me. They say they want someone who is eduated, nice and has better physical qualities but I am neither educated nor good looking. I think eduated guys are more in demand but what could I do, I had to drop out of school because of my fathers economic problems in past. I think being a good guy is more necessary....Though I work as a butler for a rich family. They are nice people. I have decided that Ill stay single for rest of my life. Some may say I must find someone who is not educated bu Im already 32. My hair is going grey and I already feel old and when I surf facebook, I often come across these works- 'only gud looking guys, uncles dont disturb'. I even tried finding someone of my age but they all are married. After repeatedly getting dissapointed, I started working hard. I worked in restaurants as a cleaner, than I became a local cook, finally I got employment in this rich house, they told me to work as there cook when I was 27 but I had this bihari accent which nobody liked, especially when this rich people organize parties, It was embarrasing to serve food and take orders and respond our guests in bihari accent. So I learned english, when I turned 31 (after working for 4 years), I can talk in english, I knew how to handle things easily they made me butler. Work's easier now and pay's good. I guess I ended up writing my biography.
Sorry :P </p>
