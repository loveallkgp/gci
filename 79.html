<p>I want to confess about me being an awesome GAY. And no, I wasn't turned at all. I was born this way, honeykids. The only thing that I look forward is to be with the man of my dreams for whom I will cook and earn to keep him happy for the rest of my life. What's embarrasing is that hardly anyone is reliable in the gay world. Many gays or even bi's run just after sex just like many straight playboys do. What's even more embarrasing is how the society see us. We are not some 3rd class objects or possessed by demons or have diseases from the west. Out of every 10 guys, 2 are gays. People of my community have been chosen to be beaten upon, to be killed, many times as an object of sexual satisfaction by some people and many times the results of brutal bullying and homophobia. We are constantly afraid of our actions in the society and sometimes sacrifice our own happiness for the sake of our parents but when we say the truth we are shunned. Please make this world a better place without discrimination.</p>
<p>-A message from a fellow human.</p>
<h1>AdminViv- Now that's more like it. We have a confident person here! Happy Diwali!</h1>
