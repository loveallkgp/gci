<p>Hi
Admins :)
I am very very disturbed at the moment
And I have a question for you AND the fellow gay janta here</p>
<p>All I've seen in past few days on this page is how deluded we all are
Noone wants to come out those who do want to are discouraged
Married men regret their choises
New shitty gov comes in
I'm pretty doubtful of our future as gay Indians
Forget society .....our own community wants us to stay "shut" and they are actually HAPPY being in closets .... Isn't it surprising ? To me its kinda offensive and (dare I say ) repulsive
So what I gather from past discussions is : stay in your cozy closets stay there and ROT for the rest of your life !
So am I supposed to stay shut up in my little illusion of a bubble nd fool myself onto thinking I'm happy ?
Am I supposed to not fight for my dignity cuz it is uncomfortable ?
I'm one of the lazy-est and peace peace loving animal you will ever find
Last thing I want is some conflict or awkwardness
But with the new gov and my lovely nation I can't help feel sorry for myself
Not to mention my own brethren who want me to shut up nd be a good boy instead :/
I'm really sad to be a gay person in such a shitty country I don't want to fight nd raise slogans on the road
I just want to live in peace holding my boyfriend's hand in the park and not invite sour stares
I want to seal my love in the promise of matrimony
I want to raise kids who are not hated cuz of their dads
I want my parents to not be ashamed of their doctor son just cuz he's gay
I want love and acceptance and living under the sun with no lies no hiding
I'm a sane honest human no criminal who has to hide or be ashamed
Is it too much to ask of gods ? </p>
<h1>Viv- You go boy! It is all what we need at the moment. To make our voices heard. And that will happen when we all decide to leave the closets and make our existence felt to the society. We always expect that by our least efforts the society should change its mind and accept us. But it doesn't happen that way. We have to come out if we want to live with mental peace. It will be awkward to the society and not us. For how long will they bother us? Atlast they have accept us. And as for the gay people who choose to stay in closets, we have to make them realize the facts about this community. Each one teach one. And when we will spread our hands to everyone around us only then the change will happen. It may take 10 years or 20 years but change will definitely happen.</h1>
