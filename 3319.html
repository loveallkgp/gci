<p>Hay admins how are you ? Hope you both are fine. Today while i was crossing staff room, my love :D :D my sexy baby :D my handsome baby called me , "Jason, today i'll come to you class as a substitution". I don't know why he called me and said. I said ok sir with a smiling face. He came to our class. He starred at me , me also :D :D  &lt;3 &lt;3 . He is handsome with his black phant with Blue shirt. He just came near to my bench i said politely, "Sir your dress was nice". You know what he said ???? :D :D :D . He said i was looking good with my black shirt. By the time  my benchmates (two boys siting next to me) asked permission and went to rest room. Now We both of us only in the last bench &lt;3 &lt;3 . I stared at him, he also , asked me to move and sit. I moved. OMG he was sitting along with me ( Gosh my heartbeat went high). No one can't say something about us, because a teacher or professor always sits along  with the students may be in the 1st or last bench :D :D . SO no one didn say anything. He came closer and asked where am staying as well as about my family. I have one grandmother, she is all for me. I said my  dad and mom were died. My Ajay baby put his hands on me and consoled don't worry, "if you need any help let me know it, I'm always there for you Jason". "Thank you sir" i replied. He given a romantic look, then he stood up , he was about to leave the place. i called him and said to sit in the same bench. he asked me why ? I was blushing. He bent down and whisphered i know jason. "When you have time come and talk with me " Finaly he understood my feelings for him :D :D :D &lt;3</p>
