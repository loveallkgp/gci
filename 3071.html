<p>There is this guy who lives in my upstairs at the flat. At first i didn't talk to him because i thought he was too much of pride regarding his looks and aesthetic. But slowly we started greeting each other and started talking actually. Im a college student living with my elder sister and he working in some office. We started serious talks and sharing everything from day-today life. Than i had my semester exams ge dropped me during my exams and picked me up from college after my exams. He waited 3 hours outside my college for almost 4 days. I started to like him. He is gay and his parents know about it. But im to shy to even tell my feeling to him. When i get drunk i in his home i try to cuddle him and sleep in his arms. Lately he is picking up on my signs but always smiles at me. He treats me like a baby and take care of me during my sisters absence. I love him too much and there isn't a single day we spent without talking or visiting each others house and he understands me. Please help how should i tell him that i like him and his presence means everything to him. Im to shy :( </p>
<h1>GCI- Awww how sweet! Okay, here's what you can do. Pick up a day when you both are free and make it totally romantic. Ask him out for a coffee, then go for a movie, roam in a park, come back home, watch a romantic move(if you want to go for a second time) and when you are leaving just hug him and kiss him on the cheek. Perfect date!</h1>
