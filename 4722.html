<p>Hello,
 I am 29 and stay at Pune, belongs  to a small town in U.P. (family stays  there and  i am here  for  job)</p>
<p>M out to my immediate family (parents and siblings), even most of my close friend and people at work (few team mates) knows about my orientation. </p>
<p>From last  few months i feel v  lonely not  even want  to meet any one or  go outside. I  have no regret but some how loosing my interest in everything. Although at work front everything  ok .</p>
<p>I  recently meet a psychiatrist for this and  he  says  everything is normal, i need not to worry. But sometime i think what's going on- I don't  want to go party, shopping not even movies. turned  down invites from  frnd  to  join  for  vacation or so. Even not  active on dating sites. </p>
<h1>GCI : its okay . time like this comes when we start loosing interest in things . i think you need new interests . i mean movies , shopping , party or meeting people or dating sites are so mainstream . i don't know how hectic is your life but maybe (if its not hectic ) .. adopt a pet , get good books , try cooking in weekends and invite close friends to eat with you , or get into more things which brings out your  spiritual side ..like where you can actually attach yourself . learn things.</h1>
<p>that's my idea .</p>
