<p>Fluctauting Feelings:
I Just want to speak my mind out and share somethings that is running in my mind and disturbing me.</p>
<p>I am quiet a cool and extrovert kind of person. I dont normally Feel deeply for anything (specially when it comes to feelings), since I lost if after my first bitter experience. After that I started believing in compromises which I still do. I was/is liked my many guys and I am happy about this fact but I cant develop deep emotions for anyone. I have been in one relationship and was completely loyal to it (even though I was compromising with my feelings), which obviously didnt work out. After that I just met guys and kept relation of friendship.</p>
<p>Present situation: I am followed by a guy(foreigner). I never trusted foreigner interms of relationship and loyal relation. That is why I never went out with anyone until this guy showed up. He is goodlooking with great job and speaks quiet nice to me. We chatted for many days when he eventually asked to meet. I was quiet unsure about it (as i already told I dont trust foreigners). One part of my mind said to give this A CHANCE. The other part was little bounded by some emotions (didnt know what it was). I said Ok but still took few more days to actually meet. Finally I decided to give this relation/Friendship a chance.</p>
<p>Under mutual agreement, we decided to meet for a date. He cooked for me and I took a drink with me. It was a good feeling as we talked a lot about ourselves, family, past relationships etc. Inbetween our talks, he kissed me. I was little confused about what just happened But didnt pushed him back. Before this could go further, I made an excuse to return back home. I didnt want to hurry for anything which i might regret later (even though I know relation here starts with sex). he wasnt happy about it. Was expecting me to stay over even if it was without sex(which he told me , as I was opposing the sex part).</p>
<p>After I am back, my mind started hunting what Should be my next step to this. he started conversation in same way as he used to before. But I am not the kind of guy who does random hook ups. But due to my fluctuating mind and some unknown feelings toward him, we again decided to meet. I went to his room. This time I crossed some limits. We ended up in bed with cuddle, kiss and hugs and agreed to stay over. With his kiss, i felt as if he Likes me but these people are so backward exprssing themselves that I got more complicated with what he feels for me. IS it some feelings of ending up to bed is the final desire?</p>
<p>About me, I am totally messed up in my mind. I was with him for the night stay and I felt AM I THE KIND OF PERSON? DOnt know what my feelings are, for him. Why did I agree to stay a night? Even though I am not restricted under anyone; I am totally confused in his actions and my feelings for him. We keep talking casually and I want to take this as a simplest incident and a experience with foreigner (which I really needed/I guess).</p>
<p>To conclude, I do believe in LOVE, longlasting RELATIONSHIp (loyal one) And SOMEONE FOR LIFe.
Just want to get over this silly experience and come back as a same mature carefree guy who takes everything positively.</p>
