<p>hi,
was traveling in an auto rickshaw today in Chandigarh. just then a guy in shorts with perfectly shaved legs (some portion had that stubby look) came and sat beside me. The trips are never so heavenly
is it okay, if I presume that the guy was metrosexual ? or gay ?
have spotted few more guys wearing shorts and flaunting their shaved smooth legs( in Chandigarh itself).</p>
<p>is it okay to go in public with those smooth legs? won't people judge you ?
I have a big friend circle here. will it be okay if I wax my legs ? I desperately want to shave mine too. Is waxing not manly enough?</p>
<h1>GCI- Sigh.. the society made rules of what is manly and what's not.</h1>
<p>European people are more into being metrosexual. Shaving the parts of your body is not gay anymore. Celebrities also do that. Male models do that. Weight lifters do that. It is more about grooming yourself and making yourself feel more confident, if you think that will.</p>
