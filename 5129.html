<p>Hi admin !</p>
<p>I'm totally depressed and so is family just because of my own aunt (KAKI) .I'm bengoli so we call aunt as kaki.</p>
<p>last month i came out as gay to my family , relatives and friends after trying and gathering guts from last year! my family (Dad, mom, sister, bro) supported me, few cousins are happy seeing my truthiness, friends they are my motivators! but the problem is that my aunt is insulting me and my family everyday !
first she used to insult about my sister in our colony saying she eloped with an guy but it's not true.. my parents understood her love so later they made them one!</p>
<p>Nd now when i came out as gay , my kaki has spreaded this as breaking news to almost in entire city.. every place, my mom's office, my dad office, my tuition, my clg and all saying that " beti to bhaag gai sharam waram khake, and beta bhi chakka nikla" :/ and you know what? only because of her.. we have moved on 10kms away from her but still she's not going to stop this. i guess If i commit suicide then only things will sort out! each and Every second person asks me that if I'm gay or not in every our from last months :( . my life has nothing now. I'm not able to go ahead. :/ bhagwan dusman ko bhi esa aunt na de.</p>
<h1>GCI- Tell that bitch to shut the fuck up. If she is not respecting you then sure as hell you shouldn't be a whimp and take her words in. You give her and you give her good. Now a days its not like that you have to respect the elders even if they shit in your pants. If they are not doing something good with you or anything, just say it to their goddam face and be done with it. Your family is with you so just be with them. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT SUICIDE just because one bitch of a woman is saying something to you. She is not sponsoring your paying your bills. Why do you even take her words so calmly?</h1>
