<p>Why people scare to expose them over here...
Bcz they know this is absolutely fake place. .
Most Common they all want you to first display you..
Most of real images have absolutely vulgar comments like its a shop of sex and best comments will be rewarded as a gift of one night with that guy. .
They have like beast that they never seen a dick nd they only need that rest feelings love nothing matter to them..
They show their nudity as they are advertising for pornities..</p>
<p>This is my request to all of you..this romeo is of us as we created it we have to manage it..dnt make your image as that..By this you are proving that gay or bi relationship are of sex..And if it will still go on we all shame of that one day facing STDS or somewhat. .
Just behave like a man..although god has made you this not to do like that...jus love someone Nd gradually you feel what that Nd what you are ...</p>
<p>shubh</p>
<p>Rest your life your wishes..</p>
<p>$ABBY : behave like a man .... ( you want them to drool on chicks ) ..  and not just gays and bi get ' STD's .. hetero are more prone to it . </p>
<p>sex i natural ... god made us sexual creature . </p>
<p>just agree on the firt half of ur message that manage the image of gay people. don't make it market of skin . stop putting vulgar images and stop liking it too..</p>
