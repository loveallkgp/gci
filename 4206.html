<p>Some homosexuals seem to come up with outlandish reasons to justify that their stand and rights be respect. One example of the same is that homosexuality be allowed and is perfectly natural and acceptable because " it has been scientifically observed in animal behaviour" c'mon u dickheads are u animals? Or humans well I am not being strictly biological or taxonomical in the definition of humans but still. rape, cannibalism and a lot more is scientifically observed in animal behaviour, let's accept that then. Really hilarious some people are you know what they are- gays no they are gay clowns.
Now before I have the dumbfuck commentators and some inconsequential blokes who believe their opinions do matter whereas they don't passing comments on my post. I would like to make a disclaimer-" this post does not target or deride any race, caste, religion or gender or sexual orientation in particular and insinuations are purely coincidental. I do not quote or plagiarise the opinions of jerky red head homophobes. And support gay rights coz I am one too"</p>
<h1>GCI- So what are you trying to prove here? That you are someone sensible who knows better? Well if you do, you could have said it in a better way. There is always a better way.</h1>
