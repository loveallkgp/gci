<p>It's usual to have a closeted personal homosexual life now..
Coming to my point.. I have always been an independent lad of liberal parents who expect me to keep up to their aspirations. Being a topper in class was usual.. and thus made no friends. Now I've always been attracted to some of my seniors.. but never have told them..
whenever I dropped any hint, they proved themselves either straight or didn't react..
and after such situations I'd started on boozing terribly to get over this emptiness.
In the long run I've met many people wjho were close to me.. but I have special feelings for just one person now. I know he's a gay and evn kissed me once in the subconscious state, but he has his ow crush whom he can't forget. now I just can't realise what should I tell him.. how should I go about this feeling of mine. He knows nothing about this and thinks me to be kinda small bro, maybe a simple gay.
from everyone of this sane world, I ask, how do I tell him about my feelings? I just don't want to spoil the good relation we have actually.. I don't want to lose a fabricated "bro".</p>
