<p>Hey Admin ,
M21
I wanna confess Something Very interesting .. I live in Calcutta bt I went for an audition in Jamsherpur for Mr. Jharkhand . I were selected and Reached to Finale .. A trainer came frm Mumbai , He was Mr. Maharashtra and well puffed hunk.. At dat tym , I was jst 16 or 17. Once I reached early for my training and I saw no one has turned up yet .. He opened d door and asked me to sit inside .. I entered , Den he asked me to watch d videos of Ramp walk .. And after few minutes , He starting doing all dose things which I had never done it b4.. he fu*ked me and I was scared and I didn't turned up nxt day , he called me up screamed on me coz I didn't turned up(treating as nthing happened yesterday ).. on the very nxt day , I have my finale and Ultimately , I won the title of Mr. Jharkhand. . from dat day I started attracting the straight guys towards me.. N m always stood successful on dat :-P </p>
<h1>GCI- Okayyyy... noted..... -_-</h1>
