<p>A few years back, when I still considered myself as innocent as a kid, there was this guy with whom I fell in LOVE. He was new to our school and we pretty much became nice friends. I was sure about my sexuality that I was gay but back then I thought that he n I didn't have a future as he was straight and I would eventually marry a girl. So I just decided to make some memories and move on. Later we changed schools and then I came to know that he was still there, somewhere inside me. I couldn't get over him. Maybe he was really the ONE I fell for? I found true love and let it go away?
4 years passed since I changed the school and still he was with me. Would I never be able to love again? Love don't happen twice I thought. And then I accepted myself as gay.
Things were going fine and soon I met a guy. I fell for him too but he rejected me. And now two people we there inside me. I met another guy and again I fell in love with him and then 4th guy and again I fell in love with him and we got into relation and then I decided to break up 'cause I thought I was cheating.. Yeah you might think I'm insane and I don't know if I'm?
Well, I don't know what love is, it's just too complicated. So I gave it my own definition. Love is when you care about someone more then yourseld and want to be with them at any cost. So those 4 guys are still in my mind and heart. I still want to be with them (all the four) at any cost and I really do care about them.
I might fall in love with more people on my way till death, so just decided to stay away from relations. I still have 4 people in my heart what if I get into realtion with the 5th one and fall again with 6th one. That would be called Cheating, wouldn't it?

PPS: I'm not into sex, only a sweey cuddle would be more then enough for me. So it isn't about sex..</p>
<h1>GCI : i deleted the post script this confessor had made ... coz it was directly pointing  at somebody . so next time this type of posts won't get posted ( containing hate speech towards any member ). if you have fist solve it outside .</h1>
<p>i won't deny that you can't have more then one person in you heart ... infact you can have many . but the thing is you are trying to fall in love... you shall stop it and let the love happen itself.</p>
