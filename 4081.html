<p>It's midnight.. I am all alone in this dark room contemplating where my life is leading to? Should I live or leave this world? It took me years to accept who I am. Outside I am loved and admired by many for my qualities but inside I die everyday. It's not like I hate myself. I love myself for who I am but I hate whenever I lie or hide anything from others. I know everyone doesn't deserves to know everything about me but I feel guilty whenever I lie. Whenever a friend asks about the reason for my singlehood either I have to lie or hide.</p>
<p>When my friends talk about their love lives I also feel an urge for a companion who could hold my hand and say that he is with me in every circumstance of life but I know my wishes are just dreams. Many might say that start loving yourself and keep yourself busy but this doesn't works. It is human desire to be loved, to be cared, to be someone's world, to give love and get back more love and care from your beloved. I want to hold hand of my someone special and feel the sensation through my skin. I want to look into the eyes of that person and feel the love and trust in those eyes. The love that will make us feel the pain of separation and happiness of togetherness to both of us.</p>
<p>I tried finding my love through social networking sites but all in vain. It is full of sex freaks...the tops, the bottoms, the vers, the dick suckers, the money-mongers..all except the one who can be good companion in all walks of life.
I chatted with many but never clicked. Most of the chats ended with their demand of pics or sex. I know that for physical intimacy there should be physical attraction also but you cannot love a person just for his looks. I believe in quality.. slow and steady.. I don't want to be loved just for my face value. I want to be loved as the person. Some facebook friends suggested that I should learn to compromise but I don't think it is love if you always feel that you are compromising.
Once I did find a friend and wished to go forward but the long distance played the villian. I am in Mohali and he is in Hyderabad. It was only a virtual relationship and I was wondering would it last and one fine day he also left me without a note. I fear that am I going to die without being loved? Is it my fate to die a lonely life, longing for true love?</p>
<p>Could you suggest me something that could help in focus and make me optimistic?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well don't search for anyone like this. You will always end up in depression. Just pay attention to other stuff like life for example and wait for the man to reveal himself.</h1>
