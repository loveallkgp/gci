<p>please suggest what u would do if u are caught with ur crush by ur crush!! it so happened, i had had a long crush to my teacher and last Christmas I got his number.
me: are u romeo?
him: yes and u?
me: I am some one who had  loves u secretly for so long already.
him: madam what are u talking about?
me: its true. 
        and the conversation of him trying to guess my id and basing on people he had associated with and my confession of love and crush for him went on. at last...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> him: please madam tell me who u really are. and if u don&#39;t and I find u out later whether u may be a dearest fren or some one truly close I ain&#39;t going to accept ur sorry. 
me: actually if u know about me u r going to be really disapointed.
</pre></div>


<p>him: no I won't just open up.
me: iam a guy.
him: busted ur the guy I met last Christmas.
   I was stunned but I am not that guy. had no idea who he talked about.
me: idont know.
him: yes u are u were with peter.
      it wasn't really me. but at last he did spell out my name.
 him:  u r xxxxxxxxxxx he3.
       was really stunned. I put down my phone and scream the hell outta me scared all of my frens. 
          the actual question.:
1: how did he know it was me? we did never really talked. or was he knowing it all along? its bee 4 years that we actually were together in school.
2: how will I face him now.? I'll be going home soon and that busted nite though last year happens still is fresh in my mind. it shame and creeps me that a straight crush of mine busted me .
      pleasee please admins and dear experts suggest me my fears.......yours xxxxxxxxx</p>
