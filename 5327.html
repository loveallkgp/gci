But the matter is I am a b.com passed out student and I am working in a firm whch was paying me 10k a mnth.and I was working for 9 hours but now when I asked them to increase it
They have doubled my salary. And I am happy for that but the problem is I want to persue my higher studies and for that I have to prepare for my entrance exams and my employer has increased my working hours as well. So now il have to work for 12 hrs in a day whch is affecting my health, and my studies.
We are financially okay neither too good nor too bad
But the problem is I dnt want to be dependent on my mother. Though she is saying me to leave job and pay proper attention to studies.
I am so confused
Not able to decide which is the best way to go. I am working in mrng shift qhch starts at 5 am. Pls advise me yar
