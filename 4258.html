<p>Hey Admin n Folks , hope you all are fine :) , Hope Admin is Studying well there in Canada :P ; hope u post this ..
Anyways , I had wanted two of my confessions to be posted , rather I would say I had sent to the google form , which weren't posted :/ sorry for that Admin, but thats true , confessions were good but i guess, you felt them irrelevant , but I was in Critical those time, bit happy as I crossed those moments in my life, not sure about What's next !!
Anyways , here is my point , why people look for cool / Hot appearance ?? Even I do it and get criticised by myself !! Eee!! But its OK , I feel its natural tendency of humans to do so.. Whatever its OK ! I feel suffocated , you know admin , I feel , I wish that I could be Handsome !!!!!!!! Or even I could have some style of mine ( I'm cannot do as I feel dumb myself , I don't get it done anyways :/ ) I feel suffocated :/ I have been in depression, you know and I need a serious answer for this , just don't comment silly and more over , I'm feeling lot of hair loss , I'm not able to find solution ! And worried that , i may go bald in earlies :( , I want to look cute !!!! That's all , please help me ....</p>
<p>Thank you !! </p>
<h1>GCI- But some people can rock the bald look! It is a style here in the west. And you just have to feel beautiful from inside. Try to love yourself more rather than depending upon other to love you.</h1>
