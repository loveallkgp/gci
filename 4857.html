<p>I love this page man . Seriously ... I mean ... I feel so reliefed after commenting or confessing here . M extreemly sorry admin at times ur suggestion goes " out of the box " but still ur sarcastic comments surprisingly interest me . I m a hardcore follower of this page . Few months ago few called me rakhi sawant of this page . But no offense yaar . What are friends for ... but yesterday I read a confession which merely spoke crap about homosexuals . It might be confessed by a straight for sure .. it was 101 % a hate confession which was posted here . And when I confessed something which I did not like . I was blamed to spread hatred around . And hence I was concluded to be banned by our admins. Muje ik cheez samajh nai ai . When a straight can have an opportunity to express his hatred towards gays then why can't I speak about something which I don't like .. ?? . And plz . I m not arguing. I just wanted to know . Its a polite and a humble questioned . And to be answered in a better way not in a rude and sarcastic way . Thank u ...</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, sarcasm and I are best buddies. Anyway, some straights can be naive to hate us because they can be ignorant fools but you being a homosexual spewed hatred against the people of your community. That's the major difference. When any confessions targets LGBTs here, we all unite and say stuff on that confession. They unite us. But what you wrote was about the division within the community. Which I still allowed and I guess I will post them in future also just to show show ignorant fools can some homosexuals be for their own people as well. I hope those posts can atleast make you think that this hate will get us nowhere.</h1>
