<p>Hello everyone.This is seriously going to be long.I am going to write something that might be heart wrenching for some of you while some of you might so happily ignore my confession.I am 24 years, old sufficiently good looking and about to graduate from a prestigious medical school.I belong to a middle class family and therefore, as anyone can imagine,i had to struggle a lot to wriggle my way up the place i am.Now,Naturally my family is starting to put pressure on me for getting married,which,i know is going to be futile,for i am most certain that i wont marry a girl and destroy many lives at once.However i am starting to think what shall happen of me when i grow as old as my parents are now?I have seen enough lonliness during my years in med school,and at no cost i want to be stuck in such state of lonliness again.I am therefore forced to entertain the possibility of getting married to a girl,somehow;by gathering enough willpower,have intercourse and produce kids and try living by society norms.It seems that my mind has been divided into two because i am not being able to make a decision-its like from a boiling kettle into a frying pan.Also I am the most introverted person one can imagine;even during my bachelors,this too in  a med school,i was unable to make any friends,let alone having a circle.I look very manly and i am well built but somehow i tend to act in feminine ways which is sensed by most people leading to me getting ostracised among any group.I also think that i am stuck in some infantile stages of my psychosexual development because my father was mostly missing during my initial years of life and i was raised at my maternal uncle's,among my maternal aunts,which could have inadvertantly led me to identify more with women,primarily my mother.There is this guy in my neighbourhood who once took me to a dark alley where he slid his hands inside my pants and made me sit on his phallus,naked;came,and cast me off near my home;i was 9 and he 20 then.Also a cousin of mine who used to live with us had used my hands to please himself during night,once.I used to have sex with this classmate of mine,who was 2 yrs older than me,for nearly five years,on the stairs of my terrace,whenever my family were absent,for  nearly 5 years,until i had to move to this city for higher studies;he is in some middle east country these days.
The first breeze of my 15th spring had me realize my love for this guy who was also my classmate and seemingly my bestfriend,is now apparently a greek god and  tends to ignore me despite living in the same city.All these years my love for him has deepened and if one were to compare the colour of my love then and now,one would conclude that it has darkened from soft red to cherry red.I am a very spiritual person and i think my love for him has graduated from infatuation to love to spiritual devotion;him i regard as my lord,my krishna.I feel like mira in his presence, whenever we meet,which is once in an year,i feel the fire in me is rekindled.I know he is a manipulative narcissist,because he has this insatiable desire for compliments and in our discourse it is always me who makes the first move, yet i cannot contain my feelings for him.He is also the only person on this world who knows of my devious orientation and even so he has always behaved in good ways with me.He is  a God.
Studies were always a matter of trifle for me but not recently.Presently i am not certain about being able to clear finals and i am under the burden of preparing for exams while writing this.My intellect and consequently my grades have deteriorated in a steady fashion,starting from the point i joined mbbs.
I feel like a worthless pile of dung and if there is any life left in me,it is the awareness of my breath and my hunger.I die every night only to wake up in the morning with a slight headache.I wake up,eat,study,eat,sleep,think,sleep.I feel like sylvia plath.i feel hungry and angry.i am crying alone in my room,tears refuse to flow though.
Now,Where and how may i proceed?Should i become a hermit?I have this intense desire to live long and therefore i had adopted a very healthy lifestyle but these days my routine is all crumbled.I also feel like a hypochondriac.They say if you live longest you are the winner.I feel like i am suffering from hypochondriac disorder too,which is in itself a hypochondriac symptom.Its a whirlpool,if you can imagine.I really have nothing to do,except study.Guide me please people.</p>
