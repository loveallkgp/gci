<p>well well.... so i finally met this guy, who was my cursh once upon a time. 11th and 12std. we never spoke in college as he was in Arts section and i was in Commerce.. its been 7 years now!!! </p>
<p>I saw him on fb and sent him a friend request and he accepted. My hands couldn't control typing an inbox message to him, which i willingly sent him after few seconds. And quickly i got his reply! Then we started chatting, asking each other about our personal life and stuff. later on the same day we planned to meet for a drink. I couldn't wait for it to get dark.. Eyes were stuck on the clock to see when it touches 8.00 And finally we met, so we started with gossiping and drinking simultaneously. Later when we both  got high, I came out to him and i also confessed to him that i had a cursh on him and stuff.. He kept quite and later started laughing like a bitch.. Anyways. i was happy that i opened up to him and luckily this is winter season going on so i got to hold him tight from back on his bike while riding home.. wow! I know that i will not get to  make out with him, but happy that he doesn't discriminate me and treats me as his good friend. </p>
<p>so this was a short little story of me and one of my strong crush. It still gives me a vibe whenever i think of it. </p>
<p>Enjoy Winter nights fellas.. cheers!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Not so much of enjoyable winter nights for me when snow enter your balls, but good for you!</h1>
