<p>I was brought up in a school, where in order to avoid the interaction between opposite sexes, the moral science teacher of the school used to constantly tell "we should see each other as brothers and sisters" and she would tell the stories of how the saint on whose name the school is named saw every woman as divine including his own wife.</p>
<p>So this was happening from very early stages, say ven before i know about my sexuality, may be 3rd grade, and that I was constantly tuning myself to that idea of seeing the oposite sex as divine and was not allowing myself internally to even look at them sexually. But I had a puppy love with a girl at 8th grade, but even before and after that, i have been attracted to men, emotionally and sexually. Now i have less than 1 % interesr with girls.</p>
<p>Whould that have made me gay ?! i know this is silly to ask, but just would it have affected to some degree ? is sexual orientation like a fluid in a plastic box when you tightly close the lid under pressure, it will oozes out from the some other side ?! Just asking ! :P</p>
<h1>GCI- Just think about sexuality as a spectrum and not just limited to binary with two extreme ends. You may lie in one of the many many shades of it.</h1>
