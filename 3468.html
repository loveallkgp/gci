<p>Hi I am a 18 yr old guy from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and accessing facebook through mobile as i do not have pc. I enjoyed reading posts here and wanted to share something about myself. I'm very ordinary next-door type guy and there's nothing special about me. I just look ordinary, walk ordinary, sleep ordinary, talk ordinary, eat ordinary, have a couple of good friends, a decent grade at school, loved by family and friends. When I first came to realize my sexuality, I kind of freaked out, denying it and all and then I had nowhere to look to. I always felt I was different from the inside, although was very ordinary outside. Then I came to like one of my best friends and started admiring him for whatever he was and did - his way, demeanour, little quirks and inadequacies. It was pleasant and at the same time extremely confusing. I was not sure - what was this? Was I falling in love with a <em>guy</em>? I one day put up the courage and told him somewhat of what I felt - and he kinda laughed it off... I was bit disappointed and started feeling moody around him, behaving strangely and awkward whenever he came. He noticed that and enquired a few times what was the problem and I shrugged it off most of the times.. soon even he started becoming aloof from me and tried avoiding me. It became disastrous, I was pained.. although I wanted to be in his presence all the time, I always cringed and sought to consciously avoid him : which he did not take well. It became too much for me one day and I blurted out that I loved him  - and he didn't say anything. Subsequently, he just never bothered talking to me and kept avoiding me after that. I cried the night I confessed to him and was simply devasted and confused - I had begun to realize that I just might be gay and this was probably my first time I realized and accepted myself as gay. It took me some months to move on from that incident and get involved in some online spaces for gay individuals... I should thank internet connectivity in my phone for that... :))</p>
