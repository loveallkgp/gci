<p>My Confession is here..
I never accept that I am a gay till now and no one even knows except those strangers i had safe fun with..Now I'm 22yrs and stay in the hostel..I have stayed in the hostel with my friend for 4yrs now..Right from the start I like him,my friend..He likes me too.I never believe in relationship esly gay relationship in life..But this time the feeling is so strong that I'm melting over his every words..We did many things together in life,he taught me how to play cricket,etc...But he never seems to be a gay or bisex..Sometime when i told him i want to jump off the roof, he replied he'll jump after me if he do that,if i moved out of da hostel he'll too move out,etc..but he's not gay..though one time he asked me am I a gay or not?I reply i hope not..And I asked da same question he said he didn't know but till now he never has sexual atracttion to guys..many times we do body massage..he's a sport man good tone, i always got hard when I touch him or see him naked, We passed urine together and I even saw his big uncut clean dick..He is too much for me with all his hairy chest, big chest,big and pink nipples,gorgeous face and his powerful eyes..3 nights I woke up at night and saw him naked on his bed sleeping soundly..I enjoyed myself watching him..den other night i cant control and i touch over his hairy breast..den next i open his zipper i touch his dick.took out and it was so nice, smells really good..den I suck once..and he called my name.I hide under his bed..he called many times and he told me what i did was really bad.I apologies and ran out of the room..crying for what i did!!.I dont believe myself i did that..but Whenever I saw him i feel shy and still want to repeat the same..sometimes i dream of kidnapping him and have fun with him.My mind getting really dirty..since i cant control myself i move out of the room and stay with others..now i am good.We are still good friend too..now he's having his first girlfriend for his life and he loves her..But my feeling for him never end</p>
