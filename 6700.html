<p>I love a guy alot.We met this feb n  were in relation.Everything was going smoothly.Thn came my vocations n I went back to my home town for 2 months we met before I left.Suddenly middle of May he said ''I don't wana be in relation I want to study (he's preparing for PMT and iam in college)n said I can't give u proper time.''
I said ''no it's ok I just want u,it will be all fine you study n when ever u wana meet u call me I will come n meet u.''
He simply said no.I cried alot n asked him not to leve me.I was left all alone once again.He left me.Blocked me from Fb and Evn Blocked my number.</p>
<p>I love him alot.Miss him alot.It's been Sept now still I cn't forget him.I loved him truely but he's no where for me.
His all promises were fake.His love was fake.But still I want him.Still he is in my Heart.But he's doesn't want me any more cry emoticon</p>
