<h1>Viv- Seems like he didn't get attention or care from anybody else like you gave him. So I think he is just craving for a bit of attention and mood uplift. You yourself knew that you and him was never gonna happen and you told him that. But he showed you the attitude. May be he is feeling bad about it. Sometimes, in people sense comes late. If you want you can talk with him but just keep it to the friendship stuff. Nothing more.</h1>
