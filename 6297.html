<p>So I am not good looking and so its obvious i got rejected from EVERYONE literally EVERYONE! even if he is at par with me in looks :) its fyn anyways! And Even if i try to make someone smile or show my concern as a friend he use to think that m trying on him :p bcz being not good looking m not getting anyone :D while i know and god knows that i nvr had such intentions because i knew already that i dont deserve anyone :) I jst wanted that may be i vll gt a friend in my life if i vll care for them but all in vain.One more thing i never tried this on gud looking guys :). So after giving up i joined an ngo that works for kids welfare and i got to know kids are so beautiful creatures when i go to meet them they all rush to hug me and if someone is teasing them they come to me and complaint to me and other kid will say m sorry bhaiyya aage se ni kahuga kuch bas aap gussa mat hona :D they are so cute they fight to hug me, to give a peck on my cheek to play with me.. and m loving it.M in a very very good space professionaly as well as personally bcz of those kids but sometimes i feel really very alone :) i want someone to talk to but unfortunately no one to listen :) bhatakta rhta hu fb / PR just to get one good friend of my community :) bt ... nyways why cant we all be like kids they are my friend and dont care about my looks but as we grow up :(((</p>
<h1>GCI- Don't let it take your self confidence down. Everyone is beautiful. You are doing a beautiful job by working for those kids. Not everyone has the compassion to do that. World is your runway and you have to own it like a supermodel.</h1>
