<p>I m moa from Nagaland and here I m with my first gay confession.
I my life has been going on well till the day I opened fb account. the thing is , I was gay but I ignored this gay thing but things started slowly and slowly when I started to meet gays in and around Nagaland but being gay has made me feel insecure now. Everyone wants to have sex all the time and I feel insecure that I may get the virus , which has destroyed lots n lots of people. Now I m wondering what life I m going to follow, coz being gay is making my life horrible , thinking of everyone who is interested in sex only.
life is a living hell for me...............</p>
<h1>Viv- Your security, your safety, your self respect is in your hands. Why let someone else harm any of it? If not what "gay life" of India is. Its what most of the people choose to be. You can choose to be different from the majority of the people and then who will see the other side of the coin as well.</h1>
