<p>I know most of us here don't take 'confessions' seriously. Most of us are here for just timepass, many of us do comment just to show how funny or good we're. 'Cause I was doing the same thing. I was like an attention seeking whore, always blurting out about my looks and richness and politeness. I literally was a hypocrite, a pretender and a pseudo human.
I never believed in changes, I never believed in modifications and thats why I believed, I'd never change. This is a part of me which was with me from the beginning, juslt like I was born gay, I was born with those fucking qualities..
But just like a fairytale, things got upside down. There was this guy on fb who added me after reading my few comments. We had a chat and he changed everything, he was so rude but still sweet, so clever, so smart.. I mean he just fucked my head but my head wanted him to stay there. He didn't care about my looks, my richness... He was just moved away by my false commnts, my false principles which I never followed.. We texted till we got exhaused, 2:32 am, I do remember. I wasn't able to sleep, I needed to explore myself, wtf I was doing?.. I stopped commenting and gave him the excuse that viv/abby blocked me. I just chattd with him, I was falling for him..
One day he said ''do u really do all those fucking shits?'' and I was just numb. I ended things with him after a week, I donno why but I did. I went away from him and from this community..
We were falling for each other. He was falling for my thoughts which I never had practised, thoughts which were hollow and empty.....
Well, hmmm, Akash Ace, I'm sorry for going away.. I had to.. I loved you but I shouldn't had have.. Sorry for not being 'me'. Sorry about everything I did.. I'm happy and I'll be happy. You too Have a happy life ahead :) :)
never had a chance to say you good bye.. GoodBye :)
yours 'Deep wala friend' ;) hehehe :D</p>
<p>PS:- I guys no offence. I need no suggestion 'cause ya all don't know about everything.. Thank you..
:)</p>
<h1>GCI- Is there a chance that I know you? Btw, everything is okay.. but you fake blamed me and abby? :'( That hurt me.. :'(</h1>
