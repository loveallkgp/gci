<p>Ok so here is the million dollar question (pun included )</p>
<p>Two guys start chatting on facebook, one  say a teenager the other say a young man of 22...both very naive and unexpirienced in matters regarding love and sex between two person of the same gender.
 And as god works in mysterious ways they start getting really close and personal, sharing things, texting and calling one another, each lost in the other as if pulled by an unearthly force towards each other, unknowingly they fall in love, and than fate comes in the middle or say sexual orientation comes in the middle, they find out each has inclinations of being the top in the relationship.
the question here is that would it be possible for two TOPS or say two BOTTOMS to be in a relationship, if so how do they work things out..because falling in love is irrevocable, we can run away from it, hide as long as we want but that feeling comes back stronger than anything imaginable and it finds us in the end of it all....so if two like minded tops falls in love, what measures can be implied to keep the bond from breaking apart (beside's the cliched "MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ) and the relationship smooth and even.
logical explanation needed from a unique exquisite mind haha :) 
everytype of rational opinion is welcome.</p>
