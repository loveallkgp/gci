<p>Its over, finally! Today we broke up: me and my "girl friend."
By the time she proposed to me 4years back, I was quite sure of my sexuality(of being gay). But the love and affection she showed, and the tempting prospect of having a "normal" married life made me enter into this boyfriend-girlfriend relation. She being my very close friend since childhood, I reassured myself, at that time, that after marriage, I would look after her so well and love her so much. Past four years, we had quite a stable relationship. Ofcourse, sex or even talk about it, never came up in between us. I always used to wonder what would I do about it once we got married. Wont go into details of breakup, but to put it simply, got rejected by parents on both sides for various reasons. A mutual breakup. Had I tried hard, I could have somehow made it work. But my guilt clock has already been ticking from the time I entered this relationship, and has been threatening to explode anytime. So I just let her go.
Personally, though I know I'm gay, I have never been with a guy till now. Now, at this point of breakup, I'm both happy and sad. Happy, because, now she will marry a straight guy who, hopefully, will keep her happy. Even I felt relieved from the guilt of "cheating" her. Sad, ofcourse, because my personal life is very uncertain now. I'm not averse to dating guys, but have several doubts on durability of such relationships. I wonder if I can cope up with issues like disloyalty, breakups, etc. I do enjoy staying alone for now, but I wonder if I would feel the same forever. My heart seems to have gone numb. For now, I have decided to put my personal life in back seat and concentrate on my profession.
I'm writing all this here simply because I couldnt share this entirely even with a single soul directly. This page is quite close to my heart. Some confessions are actually inspiring! Cheers to admins!

<h1>GCI : seriously , i respect your decision . its good to see that you aren't being selfish and thought of her life as well .</h1>
<p>i would like to tell you not to go on dating sites as pr or some other as it will demotivate you . most guys their will ask one night stands . just wait for india's decision on homosexuals. that's what i am doing right now. once gay relations become legal we will be able to search for our partners openly which will make it easy to fine a good one in real life . 
wish you luck and hope you do good in your personal life .</p>
