<h1>GCI- Denial level 100. Let me laugh on him.</h1>
<p>Okay, I am done. Yes you are positively doing right, no doubts about that. He is one of those guys who will get offended if someone calls him gay, will bully other gays with his straight friends, will never come out if that is an option, will fall in love with a guy but at the end will marry a girl. He loves living behind the mask which protects him.</p>
