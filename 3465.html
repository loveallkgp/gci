<p>So I wrote here once before. I'm a 17 year old from the north east. I am gay and very comfortable about it and even out to some close people. Now I'm online using a fake profile to find a guy to date. So after giving up hope and gaining it again several times, I've still not found anyone. I am sort of picky when it comes to guys. I have a great deal of respect for a person's intellect, wit, smartness, etc., than their physical appearance and their ridiculous six-packs. I find guys my age to be typical reckless and immature teens which doesn't appeal to me. So I've texted with some older guys. It's all very interesting until they get all weird and ask how tall I am or how much do I weigh or how is my complexion. I mean, seriously? I'm not a commodity that goes by the kilo. And is a really fair guy attractive and all others are not even worth a second look? Some drama queens find me awfully rude because I bluntly tell them to stop referring to me as dear. I'm quite realistic but I seem to offend guys who have this ridiculous ideal of a "Prince Charming". So... All in all.. It's gradually becoming pointless. I wanna focus on my career. I start college next year(probably, medical college) and it's tough. A small part of me wants to have a relationship. A major part of me wants to study, work and occasionally get drunk and have sex. But I'm a romantic at heart. And it's near impossible to find guys here. Why are gay guys so shallow? I mean, why doesn't anyone want a realistic boyfriend? Why isn't anyone interested in smartmess or intellect? Why all they want is a 'top' or a 'bottom' "Mr. Right"? And finally, is using this fake account futile? Or is it of some good?</p>
<h1>GCI- Haha you are very much like me in all of this.</h1>
