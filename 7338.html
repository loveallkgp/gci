<p>I m 28 years old and i met a guy on grindr he was 20 and he looks okayish in his pic and we chatted a lot , though he keep telling me he looks lethargic bcz of sickness but i did nt pay attention and he was so sweet , he use to make me feel good whn i was sad bcz of my family problems, he use to tell me he is sick but he was my support system, even he use to call me bhai .He was the one who help me in moving on with my ex bf who was using me fr my money .We use to share everything that happens in day via call, chats, wtsapp! He was so funny n he was needed to make me smile after a tired day. Probably its first time i gt attached wd sm1. Finally i met him n he was really a pale n tired looking guy though he looked decent bt dunno wt he looks really sick. And as xpected looks matter n i left him very coldly at CP i still remember! he did nt say nything after that neither on call nor texted me. though i miss him n i hvnt gt nyone who gv time to me lyk he did despite juggling b/w his exams. But looks matter i jst hope he vll be fit n fyn with sickness i even dun kne bout his disease i nvr asked him.  i should hv and i really wish him all the best wd his lyf :)) </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay so I am judgmental as hell in these situations. First of all, he helped you out to move on. Second, you were able to discuss your family issues with him. And third, he made you kinda happy.</h1>
<p>Then you met him and left him like that because he looked sick and not that good. </p>
<p>Really queen? Where did you leave your good behavior at? You spent in on the ass of your ex bf?</p>
