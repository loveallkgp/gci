<p>I want to do my MBA abroad and then settle in a gay friendly country. I'm open to all people, don't strictly need an Indian partner for my life. I say this because the family sentiments and commitments of an Indian guy are really strong. They get into a relationship and then suddenly one fine day decide that their family comes first. In comparison, it seems to be that- abroad, the parents don't seem to care two hoots about their children once they finish school. Am I right?</p>
<p>I know my parents will feel let down when I tell them about my sexuality, especially since I'm an only child, but I gotta live life for myself at least now. From the admin, I gathered that Canada is a good place. Can you tell me some other countries, a little closer home?</p>
<h1>GCI- Canada is certainly good. A little closer to home, good gay friendly country would be either Israel or European countries. Happy choosing. :)</h1>
