<p>I am a bisexual man technically married. I got married 3 months ago naturally it was arranged. After getting engaged, I told her truth and said that I really love her and if she wanted to leave me she could. She said that she was open minded and had no problem. After getting married she started taunting me and refused sex unless I would get another guy for a 3some. A month later she called me impotent and asked for divorce. The problem is that she is demanding 25 crores as alimony from me and my parents. When we refused, she filed a false case of domestic violence and dowry against my whole family. I was arrested for a day after which I got bail. Now this harassment is getting too much. I hate greedy women and bitches like her. Now I am totally devastated. pls help</p>
<h1>GCI : if i understand law i think its her who wants divorce and not you and since your marriage hasn't lasted even a month she can't ask for any money as you two don't have a child .</h1>
<p>secondly you can also file a case on her for mental torcher and blackmailing for money   and case for defamation . plus a girl can't really ask 25 crores  ( she isn't married to brad pitt and she isn't angelina and this is real life) </p>
<p>give her ultimatum to give you divorce on her own will . and get a lawyer  .</p>
