<p>MUST READ for so called MASCULINE GAYS
I always knew i was special. I was delicate and i was feminine. But the best thing about me was I cared about every little thing. I cared about the animals about to be butchered, i cared for the poor man begging alms at my door and I never turned away anyone asking for help. But this soft nature of mine caused my peers to interpret me as "weak and degenerate". I was bullied and mentally tortured. It changed my personality completely and causeD a few psychological  disorders
Anyways like a phoenix out of its ashes i re-merged . I got a good AIEEE rank and landed on one of the top most college i country (despite whatever has happened to me). Still i continue to be mistreated , laughed , made fun of. even though i do not interact with anyone! or act too flauntingly
So  you MASCULINE gays  realize something here? It is in the nature of the humans to torture the weak. They get a sense of power from it. It is not so much related to your femininity
WE feminine gays have endured what no child should have to bear, Since early childhood we have been laughed at, tortured, bullied, raped ,beaten. Yet we  survive. We are at the forefront of the gay moment. We are much more in number at gay pride or any of the gay event. When the stonewall riots happened(watershed for gay community) It was the "sissies" and "pansies" and the feminines and drag queens that beat the police back. It made international headlines. And that is despite our perceived weakness. But you are real men right? You are supposed to be brave? Why don't you stand up for something? Are you afraid? where have your masculinity gone? When have you EVER contributed to the gay pride movement. But wait to contribute to that one need to be proud of yourself. and YOU SIRS PROBABLY ARE NOT
@GCI paste this in paragraph format.. plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</p>
<h1>proudtobeafeminegay</h1>
<p>"We feminine's have been through ice and fire.That is why we are PURE"</p>
<h1>GCI : see i totally understand your rage and anger as after so many on this page has given negative speech against feminine gays .</h1>
<p>this one thing i want to clear all you guys </p>
<p>masculinity doesn't mean superior and feminine doesn't mean inferior .  </p>
<p>i don't know about others but having that little feminine nature in me make me feel ' empowered' ... .</p>
