<p>I realized that I'm attracted to men at a very early age,like six, when I got erected by a muscle man,whom I saw naked, who lives in front of our house.. I spent my 21 years very busy in study and had no time to think about all of this... Later... I got placed on an MNC Pune..I'm from South and completely alien to North and the people here.... One weekend evening, tired of being lonely and freaked out by excessive thinking about future and marriage and highly frustrated(as usual many of us suffer with), wanted to relax/just wanted to enjoy the present.. So I plugged my earphones and turned on playing my favorite melodies (Slow romantic songs) and started walking aside on the road.. It was very pleasant that day and the road was so clean and colorful with yellow and pink petals... The wind was so cool and it's slightly drizzling... that was the time,it occurred ever in my life, to have a pause or slow motion button that controls the time... Suddenly, I saw a guy with sky blue shirt and black jeans almost six and half feet tall very handsome, stopped under a tree.. I carried an umbrella with me as I knew that it might rain.. Suddenly, the rain started hitting the ground so hard, luckily, he asked my permission to come inside umbrella, as there are nothing around except some trees,which are not able to protect him from the storm.... We started walking together and he just saw me and smiled casually.. That's the moment, I wanted to have stop button .. Every one could easily fell to that smile... I'm unable to resist to stop staring at him.. I'm completely attracted to his eyes, pinkish red lips, his perfectly toned body, slightly visible hairy chest, finely trimmed beard and mush, his manly look We came to that street end and he said thank you,expecting him to shakehand, I raised my hand but he was in a hurry.. but noticing that he again turned back and shook hand with me and went away.. Guys, believe me, It just happened only less than 3 minutes.. But I captured it as it happened in 3 hours... I had this beautiful memory captured in my mind, and felt bad that I can't express this to anyone.. Esp. him.. But still, felt happy that I saw a person like him.. A few days later, I again saw him getting out of our company bus and walking towards our street.. I'm like stunned..!! Same company, same locality.. I wish I'm a beautiful girl.. as he is a perfect straight!! yes, I have no guts to tell my feelings to him... But still...... I adore him a lot.. May you have a perfect life my dear.. Lots of love!! xx</p>
