once I was in a relationship wid a guy ..everything was perfect..we was in so much love ..we were of same age ..I was his first n he was mine.we were both manly guy .but in March 2014 he left me saying dat he wanted to change himself n dat he don't wanna hurt his parents !! we broke up ..we too cried alot !! after d brkup also we had contact ..but nowadays we hardly hav contact !! d thing is dat I chatted with many guys in diz fake account but I met few...some were good ..I can do d one night stand with them but I don't feel like loving them !! I got many proposal but I nvr accepted dat coz wen I thought of love my x comes in my mind but I can do just one night stand with them..coz I can't control my hormones. can I b able to fall in luv again ?? coz I believe in love..but my hrt still believe dat he loves me but I too know d reality dat he won't b back in my life ..too confusion!!</p>
<h1>GCI- He is down for the bad road. He will never be happy that way. Its funny that how easily people ignore their sexuality and chose to turn which is not really possible. Instead the first step should be to educate yourself which hardly anyone does.</h1>
<p>Anyway, if you are not able to fall in love then don't fall in love. Its not really that mandatory. Maybe you should try and stay single for a while.</p>
