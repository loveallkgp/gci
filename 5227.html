<p>Hey I'm that confessor who wrote #5200 about a guy who was so close to me and left me when he knew I loved him, well it took a different turn last night. He again asked me out for a dinner, I went hoping good. We had nice time, talked a lot about various things after dinner and then he raised the topic about gays, m2m attractions and all that slowly, funny he had to start it with karan johar. He somehow thought I'm more educated in this subject and asked me so many doubts, I answered impressively I hope, finally made an impression that being attracted to a male is not something less than male and that its completely normal. After spending enough time he left. Few minutes later I got a text from him saying awesome cute lines, "I don't actually like to be gay but if my reason for being gay is to be in love with u then I'm more than glad for it." I got a flutter reading this, that moment was never forgettable, I replied that I missed him a lot. He said he missed me too and that he'll come to me when he is ready. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay... that is cute.. :p</h1>
