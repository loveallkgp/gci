<p>I think most of us are victims of sexual abuse as a child. When I was like 5 or 6, there was this guy aged 20+ something who lived next to our home. He abused me regularly for months. I didn't have the slightest idea back then that I was being molested. Actually I didn't know what he was doing to me! I am 23 now, I don't even remember his face but I still think he was the trigger! This was what turned me gay! I don't regret being gay..but I still feel sad and my eyes gets watery if I think about that guy who exploited my innocence and abused me. Hate him!</p>
<p>PS: Ive confessed this on another page some time back but thought I could share it with you guys too!</p>
<h1>Viv- It is rather despicable that younger boys are taken advantage of. I feel really sorry for you. But many gay guys are not molested. Take me and my 2 gay best friends with whom I share 14 long years of friendship for example. We were not molested but still we all are gay by birth. No one turned us. But at the end it is very good that you accepted yourself and don't worry, that guy will pay for his deeds one day or the other.</h1>
