<p>Hi admin. I know you are not a doctor but I have a medical question. Why are all pure gays skinny? I mean if a straight doesn't go to gym he becomes fat but gay becomes thin. I am talking about effeminate bottom gays only. Not bisexuals or pure tops. I have met over 20 effeminate gays online or in person. And all are skinny without workout or diet. I am 23 eat a lot, do workout, protein shakes but still 50kg only. My medical reports of thyroid, stool liver are all normal. So I think maybe gays lack some hormone or gene that makes them gay as well as skinny. One person said I must take multiple doses of steroids to put on weight else I will be laughed at entire life. I want to commit suicide due to this weight problem.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, I know people like to link things up but there is no link between being gay, being bottom, being effeminate and being skinny.</h1>
<p>Your body structure depends upon the genes that you get from your parents. Till now no "gay" gene has been identified. You mental state and your metabolism also plays a big role in your body weight. If you have a faster metabolism, then you cannot gain weight, no matter how much you eat.</p>
<p>PS- Where your brain at?</p>
