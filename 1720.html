<p>Hello my gay friends...
Its not a confession thou ..but i just wanna make something clear..
Admin please share this..
I'm mark from Korea i did confess twice in this page.. I realy love this page ..evry night and day i spend most of my time on this page thou m nt indian....u people are just awesome especially the #admin ur advice is been a great helpful to every one.. But one things which i think it'l be good if we gay maintain our own reputation.. Lets avoid texting blindly to all those half naked people.. Lets stop treating nude to unknown people ..this is also a main cause why people underestimate we the gays..its us who's only making thing worst..why not we maintain our standard and fight for our gay rights instead of making fake account ,fooling people nd so on.. Come on lets wake up and do,work,joint hands for own safety solution..
M sory if i was rude..</p>
<h1>Viv- You are sooo right buddy. But you know its very difficult to make people feel comfortable with themselves. Mostly people come on social platforms to satisfy their sexual desires and it is taken in a negative light. There are those people also who fight and do feel proud of themselves. Their efforts are not considered much. Its a slow process but the change will happen. There is nothing wrong with sex seeking but when those people are not comfortable to talk about their sexuality and their rights just because they are scared of society, it gets wrong there.</h1>
