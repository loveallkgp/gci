<p>I am working at a senior position in a MNC. Few months back i was seduced by a good looking smooth talking housekeeping boy Deepak at my office. He talked about how he had a poor childhood yet didnt give up gay feelings and fell in love with me. I fell for his charm and got intimate with him in office bathroom during overtime hours. I later realised it was all a blackmail plot and the security guard was also involved. He has camera footage of we going to the bathroom together and coming out and hugging. I have given both of them lot of cash iphones and other things they asked for or they threatened complain to HR and police that i forced myself on Deepak under 377 . Also they would upload the footage on youtube to show I am gay. I am trying to change my job and city to save myself.</p>
<h1>GCi- Hold on there! Is there specifically any proof that you had sex? Or any video showing that one of you had the penetration? If not, you can always go on him like, "You want to call police? Call it. You will also be charged under 377 and I will make sure that you will land in the cell next to mine". These guys will just scare you to extort money from you which they had. You alone cannot be blamed if they charge you under sec377. And going to the washroom together and coming out of it and then hugging each other is something straight guys do too. NO ONE CAN ARREST YOU ON A MERE SUSPICION. They need medical proofs to charge you under 377. You can always raise questions. It is your fundamental right. Sorry to say but you are victimizing yourself a lot. Do change your job if you want to but as long as you play the victim card, these people will scare you more.</h1>
