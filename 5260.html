<p>One of my gay friend connected with a guy through an online chatting network and then went on to meet him in his room. In his room he gave him some drink laced with sedatives and made a nude video of him with some other guys. In the video the other guys were shown to be fucking him. Only his face is showing clearly in the video. Now, he is being constantly blackmailed with the threat that the video will be made online. The guys have already taken money from him several times. Plz advice is there any wayout other than reporting the matter to the police ?</p>
<h1>GCI- It's a pity that this had to happen to your friend. This is a sexual assault and the case of blackmailing. I think you friend should contact an LGBT NGO in the area and get guided by them. I also think that making a police case will be good. Again, visit an NGO for more suggestions.</h1>
<p>Do not pay much attention to my idea but if your friend wants to remain secretive, then take out the details of the guy with whom he met, collect proofs. go to the police station, say that he was pushed by a group of guys in a car where they sedated him, took him to a room, raped him and made a video. And not they are blackmailing him. This is a very serious case. Tell him to delete the account on the application where he met the guy.</p>
