<h1>GCI- Listen, the fault is not in you if your parents don't understand you and accept you. Its their failure as human beings. As harsh as it may sound, it is the truth. When it comes to the children, all that should matter is the kid's happiness. You shouldn't give in to the circumstances even if the whole world is against you. Most of the people over here have gone through a lot in life and many of them have come out as survivors. You just have to find the potential and will power in yourself.</h1>
