<p>Hello GCI readers this is Abhi from Doon , I shifted in Delhi few months back and it is a nice experience being here,.. some of my friends suggested me to go to CP park and when I went there Oh my god I found it a gay hub park I enjoyed being there so I often started visiting(Sat-Sun) the park. Though I have seen many attractive guyz  in park as m well experienced now lol but they possess so much atti that I can't tolerate :( . So it was a Sunday(4th Oct) A guy visited the park I have not seen him before he was wearing some purple printed shirt with a Red book in his hands he was talking on phone and my god he was so innocent that i could literally grab him and kiss him but I dint know whether he is straight or gay :'( I want you Plz if you reading it do often visit the park shayad kisi ko vaha apka intzar rahega If anyone know him ?? please let me know :) </p>
