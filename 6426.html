I continue both relations though i loved my first bf. n my first bf got to know about my fake rln via ek (kutta kamina bc) mutual frnd, he confronted me and in my ego i told him i never loved u i always loved akash tum mere peeche pade the so i did nt deny ur love.But only i knew agr m akash k sath na rhta to meri studies na hoti bcz of my family financial problems.Now yesterday after 6 months my first bf callled me and said i cant live wdout u can u gv me one more chance? m sry fr overreacting i knew u did it in circumstances.m sorry blah blah..wt to do? M still in fake relationship wd akash</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, I am sorry that your had to go through your father's demise and financial problems but you used a person for your own needs, you lied to your bf, fought with him and left him. And you are in a fake relation with other guy. How is that working out? Either way you are gonna be an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis, or in other words, screwed.</h1>
