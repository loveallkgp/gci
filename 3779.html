<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I discovered two years back that I m gay. I shared it to my cousin brother. His reaction was disappointing. He insisted me that we are Jain and our family has a good rapport in society , so I should not do anything which defames our family or religion. 
I really wonder if it was in my control but it's really saddening. I know suicide is no solution nor giving up. I m morally shattered totally. Have nothing now except a fake account on fb :-( </p>
<h1>GCI- Again the family fame and religion grounds are gonna ruin a life of a person. Which is more important? A human life or the religion, which is a choice?</h1>
<p>Ask your brother this, "If, God forbids, you people break down financially and have nothing to eat, this society for whom you care and the religious people whom you follow, will they come to your aid?" They will move on and leave you guys be. Everyone needs a reality check, even if its your elders.</p>
