<p>I am 22 yo, looking for a good friend eventually a relationship, but every damn time i come close to someone and trust anybody, they either wanna fuck me or suck me, that's it, i mean that's all they want.Like WTF, isn't there anything else to a relationship beside sex. Now, i have serious trust issues and depression after 4 such incidents. What should i do?</p>
<h1>GCI- Just make you stand clear with everyone. You don't want to do any of it then you don't want to do it. Either they can agree or they can walk away. And if you are looking for a relationship wait for atleast 2 or 3 months to get physical with a guy just to know him more. Make sure you have trust on him before you take that step and you have something special with him. That's my personal opinion and this is something that I'd do.</h1>
