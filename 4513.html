<p>people i need scholarly answers for :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whether gender identity affects orientation during the child forming stage / during growing ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is gender identity a social construct ? ( i am very poor in all this ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So actually, a) gays can be little feminine and still be gays and b) they can be EXTREMELY MACHO and still can be gays. Am I right ? will one thing influence the other even in slightest way ? ( any scientific article about this ? )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what I mean by the second part of 3rd ques is, just because some one is feeling and behaving little feminie inside them, ( not a transgender, but a man, who feels little feminine and very rare cross dressing ), can they get little attracted towards hot macho men ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so more clearly of point ques 3 and 4, can a feminine looking / behaving / rarely cross dressing man, be completely devoid of getting attracted to hot men and just into hot girls ? any example of such kind, blog posts, articles etc ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>please, all this question is not about ANYONE in particular and requesting fellow gays not to throw your prejudices in the comment, I want answers of scholarly kind, which means i need supporting blogs / pages / books / scientists' papers who claim such opinion.</p>
<p>please treat it as for survey. I also welcome opinions, but that should be sensible. I dont want answers like, " How can you think that just because someone is feminine he is gay; being feminine is not bad, etc" please ! A question is asked out of pure ignorance and for a willingness to learn. Answers wil lbe great if its in english as I dont understand hindi. Thank you </p>
<h1>GCI- 1) Gender identity and sexual identity are two different things. Sexual identity depends upon your biological sex. Gender identity depends upon how you feel from inside. Like people who are born as males may feel like women from inside. That's where gender identity comes in. Sexuality depends upon the factor of attraction. To which sex you are attracted to is your sexuality.</h1>
<p>2) Gender identity is not a social construct. Infact being of binary sexual identity is a social construct.</p>
<p>3, 4 and 5) You are right in two of three situations. Gay people come in various shades. Also, manliness isn't associated with straight men only and vice versa. I have a straight friend who is a little bit girly and is attracted only to girls.</p>
