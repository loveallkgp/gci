<p>After seeing the post on trans genders i think they are the ones who are in more need of rights and acceptance than gays and lesbians. The life of transponders is deplorable, they are shunned by families, made to beg and disentitled from inheriting property, it has also been brought to my notice that they are detested by people and are not allowed to sit near men or women in train compartments. I also understand that they are always derided and scorned by people. </p>
<h1>GCI- Of course they are. At least one way or the other through all the struggles, we manage to live in our family and make our living. But the fate of transgenders is not so good. They are not provided with education, they are shunned by the society, they don't recieve proper health care, they can't get jobs until and unless they are educated which is extremely rare, they live in worse condition, people always look down upon them etc. But they have been given equal rights by the Supreme Court. Still it is a long way to go.</h1>
