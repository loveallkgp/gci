<p>20 Chennai.
Today I met a guy through a website and went to have sex at his home.
I just came a few minutes back from his house but while having sex I didn't have full erection (I'm normal though) and I was mortified but feeling weird when he gave Blow Job. it was still under erection. My question is since I consider myself as Bisexual and never sucked anyone but received Blow Jobs from 2-3 Men(recently) and I started to hate Blow jobs from Men too..
what's going on with me?
Am I straight?? </p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe you are bi-curious who loves getting attention on dick but later on hates it and thinks that you might have done something really wrong.</h1>
