<p>I always thought of writing about this but eventually writing it now. I stay with a few friends and we have a young boy whose our cook. Most of the time its just him and me at home as my flatmates are at work the time he used to come to cook food. Recently, he is sharing his problems and lot of conversation with me. I don't know if he is same age or younger, but calls me bhaiya. We are more friends than cook and boss, we have also hang out for shopping, meals, movies and go for a drink. He is very casual but always respectful to me, ok to hug and put my hand around his shoulder in public also. He is not the kind of guy who always look for money etc., as we went for movie and he pay for his ticket and also share dinner bill, i pay for drinks. I really like this guy but as he is married and expecting a baby soon, I don't know what should I do. I know if I do anything in haste, he might leave the job. Although few times, my other flatmate has fight with him about kind of food he made, but I supported my cook and cheered him up as he was little hurt. I really love him I think and would like to do lot for him. He needed someone to listen to him and talk to him, I am always there and also gift him my second-hand mobile-phone as his phone break. How can i share with him that I love him so much but also not lose his friendship, please tell me. Thanks in advance guys.</p>
