<h1>1323</h1>
<p>when i was staying at marriot hotels, there was one guy who was intrested in me. i was a lonely person there with no family and friends and i reall wanted to go alone on a trip. i met that guy at beach and he was attractive. he was half naked like me and his six abs were visible . i was 17 then and he was 24, we had nice and usual chit chat but it turned out that he was living in a room near to mine. we again met and had dinner together and so we chatted together a lot. he told me that he was happy to get a new friend. he invited me in his room to chat with him more and i went there. so you can guess we did sex together but that really not happened. we bith were spending time and he held my hand and removed my shirt and in few minutes we both were naked and he kissed me and touched my penis and i did the same. we were kissing each other passionately and rubbing each other's penis and did duo-masturbation. we stopped after that but then we kept kissing each other . he kissed my whole body and then i wore my clothes and went to my room. next day i got to know that he had checked out from hotel. it's been 3 years since that happened but i am no longer able to recall what his face was. i don't know why i am not able to do so and those memories of that night is slowly fading. next thing is that after that happened, i never felt any sexual desires. i became introvert after that.
i hope you won't consider this as a lie and admin won't post any funny remark.
thank you.</p>
<h1>Viv- Damn! He took your sexual desires with him? Was he a warlock? Pity.. :(</h1>
