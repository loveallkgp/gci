<h1>GCI- Come on.. first of all.. Don't tag gays as bottoms and tops like this that you have done in the confession. It appears as they are not people but sex toys. But you do know that your bf refused him and he directly said the whole truth to you. If he was any different, he would have had a secret affair without you knowing anything about it. You made a blunder by slapping him and now you are not even speaking with him. Tell me where was he wrong once? He didn't cheat on you and he told you the truth.</h1>
<p>So fall on knees, kiss his hands, say sorry and be his bitch for the coming week. </p>
<p>Aur apne best friend ko keh dena "Tera pati sirf mera hai kahi aur jaa ke khele."</p>
