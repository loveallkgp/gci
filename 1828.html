<p>Hello friends, 2 day ago i was fall in love with 25 year guy. He impressed n propose 2-3 times then finally i accepted his proposal and he love me a lot. But 3 hours ago we had chat together then after he unfriend me without reason.
His name is shravya kapoor please leave this message to him and because i really love him.</p>
<h1>viv give me suggestion what can i do?</h1>
<h1>Viv- Are you kidding me? Darling, you need a reality check. It isn't called love if it is just for two days. He was probably playing with you and now that you are running after him, he isn't gonna get back and will laugh at you. There is no reason for you to stick with him and to his memories. Afterall, it wasn't something long going. So if that hoe shows up, just smack his face with the best that you can say. Be not beneath him.</h1>
