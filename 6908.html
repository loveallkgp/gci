<p>hello #GCI, it would be great if U can share some information about Alexander the great about his sexuality.. I have seen one Hollywood movie where it was shown some scene where he had emotional relation with one of his male friend..</p>
<h1>GCI- Well yes his mate hephaestion was close to him and was his favourite, even in the Mughal kingdom transgenders were of an important position in the harem. If I am right of another Greek general, he made his love immortal for his fellow mate by erecting his statues and elevating him to the level of god and wailed 'like a woman' upon his death. Greece also had pederasty and you must read about the ;Sacred band of Thebes; to gain insight about that period where physical masculinity was not the trait of straight men only!</h1>
<p>P.S- Sexuality of the kings and emperors were always a topic of historical gossip and shall always remain so!</p>
