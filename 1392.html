<p>Hello Awesome people out there</p>
<p>i have a message for you</p>
<p>see i like you all am a closested homosexual and being n indian i too am ashamed of it
no matter who it is
what they say deep down being n indian and gay makes us ashamed
right?</p>
<p>what will society say ? the baajoo wali aunty say ? what will Mr sharma's family say?
but beyond these worries we should have a greater demon to face
What will I say?
will you ..... can you ever face yourself? knowing that every speck of ur life u live is a lie ?
shouldnt we b more ashamed of living a double life and keeping loved ones in the dark ?</p>
<p>can u go to sleep at night thinking u will spoil some innocent girls life? not to mention your own too ?</p>
<p>i know most of u have asked these questions to urself and pushed them deep deep in the darkness so u never find the ans</p>
<p>but for the sake of everything u are and can be and should be PLEASE COME OUT !!!</p>
<p>see i know its very difficult but no parent can ever abandon a child
yes they will take time to get used to the idea ... but in the end they will come around</p>
<p>as for society .. Mr sharma has debts to think about he doesnt care who u love
and bajoo wali aunty still sees u as the sharaarti kid
the society has its own problems to think about
they will roll an eye say some shit but at the end of the day ur sexuality is a no issue to them</p>
<p>stand up to the bigots who give you shit they are either dumb or ignorant or maybe gay themself pity them they try to pick on the weakest ppl
be strong and stand up to them
build support groups and help others like you
the world is full of hate and hurt, a little kindness and a little hope can do wonders for this world</p>
<p>if u still want to fuck around by night and be straight by day
i am noone to judge you
but i dont think that little voice in your head will ever shut up</p>
<p>being gay is so so so special
you learn sympathy compassion nd acceptance
you practice courage and strength
you stand and fight for what you believe in
you love differently and passionately</p>
<p>its time our country raises some curtains
our country love to pull curtains over things that makes it uncomfortable
its time we unveil our love :)</p>
<p>all the best and think about it
god knows the world will be a better place if everyone comes out</p>
<p>come out and help others do it too</p>
<h1>Viv- He says it all. All of my feelings. Do give a thought upon this lovelies.</h1>
