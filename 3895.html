<p>Hello
I am from BJP and current member of LS. I spotted this page, I don't know why but it was recommended to me by facebook. I know BJP and RSS never supported LGB rights (although some members do support) and we ourselves don't know whether we should legalize your rights or not. The political organization follows everything listed in it's manifesto but when time comes to talk in these subjects, the debators divide into liberal and conservative people who are generally elders , since we all respect our elders we can't argue much. Modi himself is probably little confused, he supports younger generation a lot and considers today's generation as the vital determinant of country's good economy and millitary which can make us superpower but when it comes to issues like this, he's struck at tge zero of integer line, neither can he enter the world of positive liberalism nor can he enter negative traditionalism. So that's why he never makes direct comments on such issues. Frankly speaking, BJP government is in it's preperatory stage to make country's economy 100 times better and so it's administration but we are trying our best to give attention to law enforcement, women's safety and many other things. We , the liberal and open minded group of BJP is working for you but we don't know what to do. If BJP is succesful by 2019 , like making country's economy better and fulfills all it promises, I don't mean to complement my own political organization, but it will again get elected for more years and it holds the potential to continue it's democratic role for more years than congress and if it happens, then the liberal group will surely be firm and make sure that it's demands like 'women safety' 'women empowerment' 'equality' 'laws against racism' and 'pro-gay rights' will be fullfilled but we need you to hold more protests and more gay pride events.</p>
<h1>GCI- Obviously I cannot know if this post is legit or not but if it reaches some good ears then its all good.</h1>
<p>Thanks sir, for putting out a statement. I completely agree with you that there are conflict of views between your party and that they are divided on the basis of morality. I'd like to mention one thing here though. To do what is right for the people, you have to hear their stories. You have to go into the public. You cannot make your views inside the closed walls and talk with those people who have no idea about the conditions a particular section of society is in. Talking about the LGBT community, I guess no one made an effort to know the true stories of children getting tormented, children living in depression, children getting disowned, children getting beaten up and children killing themselves because there is no law for their protection. Every day many people are being coming under the category of being criminalized just for being who they are. We do need anti-discriminatory laws to protect these people from the evil they face.</p>
<p>If our PM has to work for the betterment of the country and exercise the true power of the youth, then he should make his stand clear on the gay rights because if the law remains against us then gay people of the country will move out and overall the country will suffer. </p>
<p>Now talking about the economy, yes our country has suffered beyond means when it comes to the economy. Going a bit off topic here but please be with me. That is the responsibility of our respected PM to work for the betterment of our country as the leader of our nation. For that only the majority has elected him. Our country can flourish as he or your party may have dreamt. But if you look at the grass root level, the social structure of our country is crumbling down and if you don't work for its betterment, it will be broken beyond means. I see so many hateful comments and posts in the name of our PM and religion, with whom he may not have any direct relation but there are people who will bring the respect of the country down in every sense if measures are not taken at the right time.</p>
<p>You would have indeed heard the phrase, "United we stand, divided we fall." It holds true in every aspect. We are not asking for any special rights, we are just asking of equal rights. Even though I just went to Canada for education, I always plan of coming back and I don't want to be a second class citizen just because I have a different orientation and don't fall in the stereotype of normal. Again, to make laws for people, you have to reach out to them. Don't go for the majority as it will be injustice to us. </p>
<p>The time is now. You just came power. If you remove IPC377,the majority will feel bad but after sometime they will forget if they hate your decision because that is the basic Indian mentality. </p>
<p>As a gay person and the proud citizen of India, I do ask you to make the correct decision which favors humanity and for which people will remember your party as the fair and just political party. Hope this does sends a message. Have a nice day.</p>
