<p>I've been with my bf since one month. I love him, but he is busy and he feel that my love to him gives him stress. I'm doing my best to control myself from seeing him to much now, even though I still miss him a lot. We were especting a nice valentin's day together. But thing didn't goes well as we wished.
I've been so sad for 2 days. I'm trying to give him some space. But sometimes I cant stop calling or texting him just because I'm afraid to loss him.
Please give me some advise, I wanna be the one who stay with him as long as I could till we get old. </p>
<h1>GCI- You should note that you cannot force love on anyone. It should come from within. The things that you are doing are making him suffocated, maybe. Everyone needs their personal space in their lives. And you have been together like since a month? That's too soon to make each other's center of life. If you push in too much, things are gonna get out of hands from your side. Too much of feelings at this stage is not good. Trust me in that, I have been there.</h1>
