<p>Renjith by name frm Kerela ask me for a fren request....and accept him, he is quite handsome like karan grover. He kept his real profile pic, i shared my pic too in his inbox....he began to ask me my nude photos of which we shared and he enjoyed himself masturbating twice....he wants to see my close up pic...and full body of mine and sent to hm acording to his request becoz i trust him. Than next day he than rang me up...and claiming me that i hav updated a post an offer fo sex and free, i was surprised coz i hav nt log in fb for that day...and hav nt updated such...than we chat again in fb...i ask him about that matter bt he beat around the bush...so i js quit asking him...than he send me his another numb. saved it....than the next day i tried calling him frm both the numbers, it was strange bcoz it was a different people...they told me we don't know by the Renjith....blah n blah.....than i sent Renjith a mesage where i scolded him because it may lead to serious problem fo playing with me, than after a few hours he blocked me...and nw im nt really sure whether all those profile pic were his...so i would like to request people to help me if he happen to misuse my pic as his profile pic and do all non-sense things wit my image.</p>
<h1>Viv- How can you trust someone so early with your privacy? You might as well add them in your real profile if sending out pics is easy for you. Next time just don't send your pics to anyone even if you know them for a week.</h1>
