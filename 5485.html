<p>Experience is the key to everything which can tell that life is not rosy- its about hardships, going out of our comfort zone and falling down so hard that there is no way to go but up. Penning down few harsh truths of life you realize with experience..
Understand dem bczz dey gonna help u in dis fake n real world. I hope its not wrong.
1. The world doesnt revolve around u: Its not always about u.
2. U are going to loose alot of friends,&amp; its going to hurt: Even best of friends might fade out of ur life.
3. U never knw when a goodbye to someone will be the last: So, never keep grudges.
4. The people u love may not love u back: And its going to suck.
5. A lot of people only pretend to care abt ur problems: There will be times when u will think that u r on ur own.
6. There will be times when u see oder people doing bttr dan u: &amp; u will feel like ur life is gng no where.
7. U wont get wt exactly u want: Realizing dat wt u wanted wasnt meant for u.
8. And u might even fail: but dats never d end.
9. Life will give u exctly wt u need, not wt u want: Life is indeed unfair, it just takes a while to undrstnd dat.
10. There is no 1 who can help u make urself a bttr person, except u: U r ur own rock. U always will be.
REMEMBER:
" For what it's worth, it's never too late or, too early to be whoever you want to be. " :) :) :)
