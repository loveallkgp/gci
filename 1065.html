<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    hy viv n good eveining ya all

    going straight towards story which holds an integral part of mine

    right from the start i was a weak boy who was over pampered by his parents (being only child)
    i was constatly bullied by a cousin who was two years elder to me
    i was too much cared for by my mom
    so had no / few frndz
    i gues i was girlie form beginning
    as far as my memory recalls
    i was a geek/nerd cum bookworm in my school who would cry iver every lil thing

    i was nt good in games neither in loks
    looked a bit girlie

    was teased by the names like &quot;&quot;50-50 , janaani , 6no. etc. &quot;&quot; n only i know n can feel trauma that i had to undergo

    it continued till last year of schol i.e 2013

    today i pretend to be strong etc, over here

    bt instead m shattered , alone n discouraged n agonized

    dont know wat to say more
    suffice to say never judge me by my chats

    n to add to preovious message

    i guess my urge to be famus here n have alot of folowers derives from my loneliness in the past
    i had no bestie not even now dont know y
</pre></div>


<h1>Viv- I know how it feels. Everyday you had to go through the same torment. Everyday you had to feel the shame. Every fucking day you had to see those faces. It definitely is torture. You should really talk with guys about it. Earlier I used to feel just like that but now when I am feeling alright to share my experiences, I really feel the burden lifting off of me. I guess you should do the same.</h1>
