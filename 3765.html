<p>hey admin one more from me...
I do my pg in one of d reputed colleges of south india, and I stay in d university campus hostel, I saw this person in my first year I still remember the place and time it was on august 9 at 5am  where for the first time m hitting a gym, and there I see a well built with lovely trimmed beard( I always love to see him in different styles he does to his facial hair) in that morning even dogs were so horny to have sex he looks at them and says to my friend in malayalam that even dogs are in good mood.
he was just amazing with his body perfect fair n wellbuilt and lovely thighs, n awesome face.
I see him on very random days coz he is not frm my course. the only place I get to see him d mess halls and I love his boxers. and I wouod love to see him in briefs. and his boxer colors make me go so wild n crazy... especially his blue boxer wid white deers on em and I get to see his lovely bulge. omg I love it. and some times I see him wid his gf taking a long walks In d campus. shez so lucky. I know dat I crave him so much to have wid me but never took any initiative even to know his name. I never spoke to him though some of my frnds are his frnds too... 
I just love to watch him... some time I get so many wet dreans where we bith had awesome time making all my fantacies cone true. u guys cant even imagine I have so many fantacies for him.... omg it awesoem to look at him. whenever I go to mess hall my eyes look for him...</p>
<h1>GCI : see its good to have fantasize a goodlooking , well built man but we shall always stay in reality . we shall have control on what we are doing .</h1>
<p>if you will talk to him its hundred percent obvious thing you will try to go further with him . then you will cross limits . that guy is having a gf and probably happy with that . 
i don't want to pop the balloon but  just don't do anything where you will end up making fool of yourself. there are many guys out there , don't waste your time on somebody with whom you have no chances .</p>
