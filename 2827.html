<p>I used to be like "OMG!! Love ain't real!! 'Cuz even though moi is fat but good and charming, no prince on white horse! It's all fairy tale!! Even in fairy tales all the fair maidens get taken! Boo hoo! I wanna die! Boo hoo!"</p>
<p>Well, it was more serious than that of course, I still haven't sunk to "boo hoo" yet (&gt;_&gt;)</p>
<p>Anyhoo, now moi is like "Step aside fatass, it's time the rational me takes charge. So here is the unbridled truth. If ya're hawt, you get them hawt guys eazay! But you ain't the only one who wants a prince Charmin'! Them princes want a charmin' boi too ya bitch! So now if you want 'em hot boys, get yaself sizzlin' or just ask only for much ya can chew. Gettit? NOW GETCHA FAT ASS TO DA GYM YA WHORE!"</p>
<p>People who say looks don't matter, please, stop kidding yourself. I mean if you want a cute guy, obviously that cute guy wants a cute guy too! Why should awesome people settle for something less awesome? Because this post is anon, I will tell this. I am fuckin chubby. I have stretch marks, a pot belly and body hair which grosses me out. But I want a cute bf. Hell, who doesn't?! So I decided a cute bf won't hail from the sky with the rain. I must hone my hunting tools and skills :P I am planning to join a gym next month , exercise that fat out first. If my parents don't allow gym (I am 18 and not yet emancipated).
In won't settle for anything less that a cute, caring bf. Or u don't want a bf at all. Yes, I am damn stubborn. So all aspiring oh-I-am-so-ugly-I-hate-the-world singles, start making yourself deserving than cribbing about how unfair the world is. I tried committing suicide at the unfairness of this world last December, but well, even though I am not close to my parents and don't expect then to accept me, they still brought me up and made sure I grew up as healthily as possible so I want to pay them back for all that one day.</p>
<p>So go, start living in this unfair world instead of your fantasies, and make the best out of yourself.
For the one with suicide prospects, however worthless your life may be, please at least consider those people who raised you, however much of a pain-in-the-ass you might have been but they took your shit and kept you alive. So don't make them regret wasting their money and time, if nothing else.</p>
<h1>GCI- Someone watched too many ghetto movies. Bleh! But biatch, you is sayin' the goddam truth! Them shawties 'ere need their ass to be spanked by some real truth which you did!</h1>
