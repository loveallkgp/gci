<p>Well, I'm going to share my situation since I was born, this confession might be boring or longer, but i bet that you guys can relate to it....
I was born in a middle class family, i have really strict dad and drunk brother and helpful sisters, so i spent most of my childhood staying at home with my sisters, I still remember watching titanic on eid and overwhelmed by beauty of leaonardo Dicaprio, i wished if i could kiss him, i was just like 6 years old. As i grew up, i was always target for the bullies, they used to call me many things, but the word which used to hurt me the most was "ladies", it used to hurt my ego, seniors used to touch my ass etc.... I used to cry a lot but i didn't know what was wrong with me, but later on, i started to realize that something was different.... Whenever i used to see any attractive guy, i wish if i could see his dick, i would think about getting kissed by nude guys, soon i realized that I was gay, now, i just curse myself a lot, my mom loves me too much, and this prevents my from going to any other country, i wish if there were some gay prophets or gods in every religion so that parents and society would accept their kids naturally, i sometimes get crazy on god, but at the same time, i feel blessed that I don't belong from the community of so called straight people who rape girls, I'm totally straight acting guy and now I don't get bullied or picked up, but seriously guys, whenever i see straight couples making out or holding hands, i feel so jealous, i wish if i could do something for gay community and young gay Muslims... People say that we gay guys onlseek for sex, wait, what's wrong in that? At least we don't marry and then betray, we don't burn people for dowry, we don't throw unwanted kids in trash, if straight people had accepted us, it would've been so nicer for us and we would have been in peace along with our gay partners. And I'd also like to say that, I'M GAY AND IM PROUD OF MYSELF..... </p>
<h1>GCI- AMEN TO THAT!</h1>
