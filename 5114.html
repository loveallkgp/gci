<p>hi admin, need your suggestion. My confession is that i have account on PR And on last monday while surfing i met with a known teacher who taught me in my childhood days. At that time i had no attraction towards him dear. Now when i see him and came to know that he also likes m2m relation. I started chatting with him. We both live in same area with a little distance. He is asking for my name pic and mobile number and assuring me of a honest and trusty relationship. I know that he is a good guy but still i am confused whether to say yes or no to him. As i have fear of opening up in front of him. also i act straight in the society yet bisexual. So please advice me. Valuable comments will be appreciated</p>
<h1>GCI- You can't just jump into a relationship. Take your time, meet each other, find out if you are compatible or not and then take the step further. And you do know that he is into guys. So why you are afraid?</h1>
