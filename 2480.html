<p>Hey bro..whatzup.....am drunken now...got guts to open up here man...u r doing gr8 work yaar...mummaahh....here is my story n confession.....was in dreams thats my mate in college days will.be my better half whole life. But.......took.my life ahead to lift my status up where i met an married asian...was hapy to acpet him and his family as my own. Well again he was not my destiny...he was maried twice with a guy too...used me as a guy to.give their private.space...was hapy for that too but i needed my space with him...so again i slipped.......i got maried in the end bcoz of my family...got a baby too....but this God plays a villain role always....made me to meet my destiny..but he was late comer....he was ready to accept me and my family. Same as i felt with that asian. Am not rude to spoil his life. So forced him to mary too...he got maried too bcoz of my force. How sweet he is na. Realy i felt garv that i can make some one mad for me...now he is missing me always and i miss him every pal....it may be a curse for.being indian. But for me n him, missing some one tells the factor of love...for us lovers should.not get married. Their love will.be growing each n every pal. Bolna..r v right?</p>
<h1>GCI- I know its not possible in most of the families in India but atleast if you knew you were gay, you should have restrained yourself from getting married. But now you are married and have a side affair, I don't think that is right.</h1>
