<p>Hii...I am 19 years old boy..I met a guy on a gay dating website last year in March...he is now 41..I was not into aged person..that doesn't mean I hate them or I don't like them..I just do not feel comfortable with them..but I make friendship with everyone..Look,age,religion,complexion are not big issue for me. ..Anyway He offered me friendship ..I accepted..we used to talk over phone for a long time and used to chat on facebook..one day we had met in person..I had already started to feel a weakness for him but didn't say him ..we both are from Calcutta..We spent a good time...Then after 3-4 hours I got back at my home..on the next day he smsed me saying "I WILL  COME 1000 TIMES TO BARASAT(a place in kolkata) FOR YOU"..etc etc...after few days he messaged me on facebook and said "I WILL NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE AGAIN SONA ..I PROMISE.".(ami r karor preme porbo na..ami kotha di66i--in Bengali) etc etc..After few days we met for the second time at barasat..he came by his car and we went for a one hour car drive..it was in the evening suddenly we had had sex in his car..however on the next day I asked him on facebook "When will we meet for the third time??"..he slightly skipped my question but answered in a casual way..he said when we both  will get free time..however we used to talk daily...after 40-45 days suddenly I noticed a change in him..but I didn't talk about it..One day he told me he can't have sex because of a spiritual reason....I believed his words..so I didn't tell him to have sex with me but anyhow I caught him and came to know he is having sex...He did not even say  sorry but I forgave him because of the relation..Then after few days he said we are just friends, we are not lovers,don't act like lovers..BY THE WAY ALL THIS CONVERSATION WE WERE DOING OVER PHONE,SOCIAL MEDIA..Anyway I remain friend..after few days again he said he will not have sex with me because he has some ethics in life..he can not have sex like a street dog..I believed his words ..again I caught him and forgave him...By this time I have already told him I LOVE YOU but he rejected..it did hurt me but I was in his side as a friend..ONE THING TO INFORM..After 2nd meeting I have told him to meet with me 100 times in 6-7 months but he didn't meet..he gave lot of excuses but I had not been rude to him..I listened his words..THOUGH HE met with other boys .but he had no time to meet me.....Anyway  I was silent because I was weak for him..there were so many times I SAID SORRY..even those were not faults..Even I did not know why I am saying sorry.."LEAVE ME ALONE""STAY OUT OF LIFE""FUCK OFF" etc etc were the common phrases used by him on me almost in every week..But I was so weak that I did not leave him..he turned the romantic relationship into friendship..it hurt me but I was okay with it because he told me if I love him,he will break the friendship also..however I used to cry all the time..I used to message him waking up at 2 am..but he did not accept..I could not eat ,sleep..But I started to see him as my good friend ..then we met again and had a kiss..and he fixed a next sexdate..but I was feeling weak again that's why I told him "No,I can't have sex with you"..he said "you are a emotional fool..please keep your love away from me..plz have sex me" he said this 20 days ago..he even arranged a sex date but due to lack of time we didn't do that..however he told me" I LOVE YOU" 1 week ago..now he is saying that he miss me,he did not feel my importance now he feels it..he is saying IF I  get accept he will get hurt etc etc..but now I have no romantic feeling for him and I told him that..we can be good friends..I don't know what to do..please help me..I have a little weakness for him but I am not preapared for relationship or don't have wish to go in a relationship..But I am worrying if he will get hurt because of my rejection or not..what do u think..??..please help..(Anway he had a relation for 9 years with a guy which had a bad ending as he had said..and he is saying if i don't accept he will get hurt for the d time)..I am telling him to be a good friend now..but he is saying either I have to be his boyfriend or I have to leave him alone..</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, ask yourself if you can really sustain his presence after the way he treated you or the way you let him treat you. That entirely depends upon you. He used you for sex, he mistreated you, called you an emotional fool(which you were), kept you on the hook and you allowed him, and then he wanted sex from you again! He did not care when you were hurt, why should you now? He knows that you have a weak spot for him and you will make mistakes when it comes to him. Just stick to your decision, even if it means leaving him.</h1>
