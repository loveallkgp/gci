<p>Hi,
I am 22 and he is 29 and married. It was indeed love at first sight for me; of course I didn't know that he was married when I saw him for the first time. Today it has been a long while and we both are close friends. But the only thing that I couldn't tell him is how much I love him. And it again leaves me perplexed that why doesn't he see my love for him. I literally do everything for him, but still no luck.</p>
<p>I really confess that he does talk about his married life, and I just pretend I am listening, but in the back of my mind I hate it. Just want to tell him that I love him much much more than anyone in this world does!</p>
<p>Its really difficult being gay. Hope he realizes my love some day. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay lets assume that he acknowledges your love. Then what? You want to be his partner? Do you think that it will be possible for the two of you with him being married? Make it totally platonic with him and search for the real partner somewhere else.</h1>
