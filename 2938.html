<p>Hey admin, I want to share something really complicated,n now I dont understand anything about it.......</p>
<p>I had starting liking a guy n since I m effeminate n expressive at the same time, my affection for him was at times taken as my love......but he never questioned me, we were going smooth, I was thinking that its just another crush of mine which I will get over with after some time like I have done in past, cos of my experiences I believe that I should not expect that this fairytale thing can ever happen to me........</p>
<p>We were in hostel n for past some time, sharing a room, initially when we used to sleep, I maintained the distance n made sure that I dont touch him not even by mistake.....but then one day,i lost control, it was a clash of dream n reality, I thought thati was caressing his hairs in my dream, whereas I was doing that in reality, he didn't ask anything n I was scared like hell to talk about it n thought just like other things we both would sleep over it n things will b normal, I cried alot but then regained control....then I didn't lose control but at times that guy used to give some hints that he likes me or may be u can say that since I liked him I took those actions according to my perspective....n then one night we were just arguing uselessly when he said me meri teri g**** mar lunga n I said u just cant, n then after some stupid arguments, he said I will do it n I said lets c...n then we did sex, that was fr the first time.....
Then after few days we were sleeping, n he asked for it again, thinking that he likes me, I agreed to it, but then he stopped half way n said that its not right n we won't do it again. .... but even on saying so every night, he would enclose me with his arms n legs, I would get really excited, I thought that he likes me n is in a denial phase, thinking this.....when he slept like that with me for 3rd or 4th time, I touched his penis, he didn't say anything n I took his silence for his consent.....n even after saying that its not right, once he asked me what happened last night between us,i got scared n didnt tell him tht I touched him, he initiated sex 2 times again n did with me, which, left me utterly confused, thinking in a positive way, as I have told I thought that he is gay n is having difficulty in accepting it, n I didn't say no to him thinking that this might help him to come out n because I loved him n still love him more than I have ever loved anyone........</p>
<p>Then after 10 days, in which this sex n touching happened, he stopped doing it, which was even more confusing for me....</p>
<p>But I didn't do anything,i didnt even touch him or anything while sleeping before the last night in hostel, when I got really emotional n was crying he hugged me n we were sleeping, when again I lost control n touched his butt like he used to touch mine.....n suddenly he stopped me, I was half asleep, I didn't even know what I was doing, when he asked do I like him n denied.....</p>
<p>This was the biggest problem between both of us, couple of times I tried to talk about sex that we used to do, he dodged n twice when he asked I backed out....n this gave rise to so many complications between both of us, on our faces n for evryone we were really close friends but inside we didn't know what the status was, he told me once that did first time with me because I am effeminate n later because of lust.....n on the day we were leaving, he said that he did everything because of lust, but for me the damage was done, I have had crushes in past but I have never lost control on anyone because nobody has ever done that with me n also because I have never loved anyone else like I love him.......</p>
<p>After our colg, we went for a company training together, n there I touched him thrice in some one n a half month, it was because that I had lost control on myself for him....couple of weeks back we got separated as I have moved to a different location now n before separating, we were drunk once where I intentionally apologized for touching him without his consent, told him tht I am gay n I love him, he said that he felt very bad when I used to touch him, he said that the way he used to sleep with me was just a part of experiments that he did on me to check my orientation, I took the entire blame n haven't told him yet that his experiments made me feel that he likes n because of which I took the next step of touching n ol......
We are still in contact over phone, we talk frequently, but at times I can sense an anger for me in his voice, I feel so confused n depressed sometimes,cos I still love him like a mad person ..... Was it just my fault ??? I am open to all the criticisms and suggestions....</p>
<h1>GCI- How can a guy have sex with other guys for more than 10 times and still be straight and to top of that in denial? You don't have to take the blame! I feel like he is just putting the blame on you to be guilt free because sex happens from both sides. It cannot be an experiment to prove your sexuality. A piss poor joke he played. Honestly that guy is not worthy to waste your precious time upon. Its too much complicated and too much headache. Move on and get a guy who actually deserve you.</h1>
