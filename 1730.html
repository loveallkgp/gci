<p>well confessing for the very first time in my life..:P
here i go..:)</p>
<p>when i was 18 i came into relation with a guy he was approx 24 dat tym...
at tht point of time he loved me lyk anythng..but i was not mature enough by my mind to understnd wht exctly is happenng wth me...i broke up wth him after a month approx by giving a vry foolish excuse..</p>
<p>after few months of break up i realize tht even i strted to fall fr him..its just tht i was not able to accept d thng at tht point of tym..when i realise tht i strted to love him i reached him back, i said him sry 100s of tym but den he strted ignoring me..avoiding me..at tyms he accept tht he do love me still(only when he is drunk) but when he comes out of his hangover he again say tht he doesnt love me nymore...coz of all dis...i was not able to get extly whether he love me or not..d nly thng i knw was tht i strted loving him lyk nythng..</p>
<p>coz of all dis mental drama happenng in my life i ruined my boards nd den cpt...(although i performed good but not upto d mark i can)</p>
<p>my life is going lyk dis nly frm d past 1.5 yrs..now suddnly one day he come to meet me at my home..we hve lots of discussions abt d past..abt d future bt nthng is settled actually...now wht he want is tht to strt evrythng frm d vry beginng...he wanted to strt as a frnd..i dnt knw whether to accpt tht or not..coz listing to my heart it says a big yes coz i do love him but my mind says a big no...coz in d past 1.5 yrs he hurted my ego nd my self-respect a lot...</p>
<p>well right now i m tryng to leave d thngs on d destiny...tryng to actually come over d love i do to him..lets see whts dere fr me..:):)</p>
<p>can nyone tell me how to stop loving dat guy whom i love frm d deep of my heart..i knw i was wrong at tht point of tym but fr tht i felt guilt nd said sry to him a lot of tyms..its not nly tht i hve hurted him..in the past 1.5 yrs even he hurted me a lot den i hve hurted him before 1.5 yrs..</p>
<p>frankly speaking i m all cnfused wht to do wht not to do..wht is happening wth me i dnt knw..</p>
<h1>Viv- You hurt him and then he hurt you, they cancel out each other. See if the destiny is giving you the chance once again, then you really shouldn't let it go. You realized your mistake and said sorry. Now, why he wasn't able to get back to you was because he was deeply hurt. I can understand his position. Ego shouldn't really be there when you love someone from the core of your heart. But if you really want to leave him, then tell him so and do not have regret after that. Can you leave him without having guilt?</h1>
