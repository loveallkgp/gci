<p>anyone who want to be my frnd pls comment accordingly. looking for a loyal friend.</p>

<h1>Viv- Suicide is NEVER an answer to your problems. Neither is crying. Many of us are the only sons of our parents and we dont want to loose them either. Tell you what, look at karan johar. He is successful and almost everyone knows that he is gay. But does he have the need to come out? Should he say it out loud? The point is, when you are successful then how you live and whatever the way you live, it won't matter. The society will then look upon you as a worthy example to follow. So put your head up, your tits high and work for a better future.</h1>
