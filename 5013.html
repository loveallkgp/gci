<p>I am going to use some words which may sound disturbing to some of the readers, i am asking for apologize me and be tolerance to my word as i tried by my best to avoid the hard words.</p>
<p>I usually describe myself as bisexual cause i have hots for both boys and girls. I am versatile but don't like to be dominated so determined myself to called versatile top,please don't ask me to define the term.so i kept looking for bottom who willingly allow me for anal as i have never tried the actual pleasure of sex. ( fyi i tried to be bottom once but never felt anything pleasant in it and i was so distressed that i had to ask my partner to leave) so coming to the point as my today's partner was bonnie and a feet shorter than me as i am 6 feet tall, as i was not much taken to his looks,i said whatever on the looks i am gonna fuck him anyway,at the beginning foreplay was good bt when the time came to put my thing into his my thing lost its interest to go into him,i have tried many times to make it feel stronger bigger but all my attempts were in vain,here too i was under the harsh situation that i asked him to leave.</p>
<p>I am so much frightened that what would happen with me,am i the most unacceptable piece of shit in nature destined to live alone, the thought made me feel so terrible that i thought i have no right to ive anymore</p>
<p>There is only a chance left may be i am not a bi am a heterosexual only but what will happen if it goes on the same way for mating with a girl????? I am so paranoid.....</p>
<h1>GCI- OMG you think too much. Whenever you are in bed with anyone, just think that you have to enjoy. Imagine that this is gonna be the best time in your life and this person is gonna rock your world for the next 15 minutes. Otherwise just use your hand.</h1>
