<p>I am in long distance relationship since 5 months but now we are facing problem as we have lot of differences between us . i love my bf very much n i dont want to leave him but his behaviour towards me is not the same , he loves me but is not ready to change for me . he always do what i dont want him to do . i have told him many times about this issue but every time he refused to change his behaviour he is ready to leave me if i have problem with his behaviour but he is not ready change his bahaviour .he gets attracted towards other guys , he always criticizes me .he prefer to spend time with other gay friends even when i am available to him at same time so i have decided to leave him .should i leave him? </p>
<h1>GCI- See, if the change required is something that will change his personality, it will not be good to force him to do so. You have to accept him as it is. But if the change is required in the name of preventing him from seeking guys out of relationships, then it can be thought about, You have clarify if he is sleeping around with anyone or not. If he is not, then you really shouldn't force him at all. And if he is, then you can do whatever you want. Relationships are all about having trust, loyalty and proper set of priorities. If they turn toxic because of valid reasons you have to let them go. Just assuming something and then fighting over it will not resolve the issue. What you got to do is sit with peace without ego and TALK.</h1>
