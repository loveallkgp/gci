<h1>GCi- Ehhhhh....Considering the age gap between the two of you, it would not be wise generally because a lot of things at the mental level will be different. However, there are those who can make it work and be the best of partners. Here what you have to do is ask yourself, that you truly want to be with him or not. If you want to, then just date and get to know him more, without sex. And be careful to let out all of your emotional feelings too fast too soon. Not to scare you or anything but don't let that guy take any naked picture of you or let him make a video etc. Cases of money extortion are happening and young guys like you can be the victims. Be careful and be safe.</h1>
