<p>Hi,
I am 23 year old woman (But I still feel that I am just 16 year old girl :P ) Actually, I am straight but I find two boys loving each other soooo cute. My elder cousin came out few months ago to his family and we all accepted him. Just few days ago he came with his boyfriend at our home to have dinner with us and I swear, they both looked so cute together and both of them were soooo chivalrous. They both are tall heighted and have this masculine body.
There is something which I feel guilty for and it is that I was playing 'detective detective-sherlock and watson' with them and it found them kissing each other :P :P and It was sooo cute. I wish my boyfriend kissed me so passionately. :P :P :P
Well, another thing, me and my friends like watching gay porn. If boys can watch lesbain porn than why can't we?
:P
:P</p>
<h1>GCI- LOOOOOL! Its soo cute what you wrote! God bless you and your cousin and his partner.</h1>
