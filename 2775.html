<p>I'm in a horns of delimma
To be honest i want the whole world to know that i'm gay and i'm happy with it but the complicated fact is that my parents would never accept it since i've a religious upbringing and the hard truth is I'm christian. And also i'm the only son and as a tradition i have to live with them forever. My parents would die of embarassment if i bring home a Dude as my wife instead of Chicks.
Help me out here cos i feel i won't find absolute happiness ever if i have to live with a girl forever. </p>
<h1>GCI- You will not be able to continue that so called relationship with a girl even if you get married with one. The life will be a complete misery. Maybe for once you should try to get a stable partner and then work something out with him. If you are living happily with him and you are successful, then no matter what happens, your parents will be contended to see you as a good child that they raised. Be not a coward and give in. Seek the happiness the way you want.</h1>
