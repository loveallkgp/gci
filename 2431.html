<p>What I am going to confess today is extremely shameful. So people who are of very high moral standards should not venture into reading it (initial warning). I am a decent and handsome man from a respected and well to do family. But the moral lessons that I got from my family members and society at large could never condition my mind on expected lines. I always got attracted towards male body. Even the male members of my family which includes my father and uncles, could not escape from my lusty desires. I had a huge crush on my father as he was a very handsome man; powerful and hairy and also the closest and the most accessible to me. One day when I was about 15 yrs of age I could not control my desires and did something nasty. My Mom was out that night in some relatives place. I was sleeping with my father. In the night he was wearing a lungi and a vest. I kept watching him and at once I started to put my hand in his private parts. I felt it overwhelmingly and finally i masturbated. My father didnot told me anything. The next day He secretly told everything to my Mom. My Mom counselled me and sounded extremely distressed. I never repeated that mistake in future but could not reign over my lusty desires towards him for a long long time till I turned 20 yrs. Today, what I want to share and confess must not be confined to that one single incident. I have always felt that I am a misfit, a person who is unable to conform to the sense of right doing and wrong doing that the society has endowed upon us. This has always led to serious problems in my life. I have always been unable to found a reconciliary note with the social norms on one hand and my sense of extreme freedom and sexuality on the other. I have time and again come to terms that all kind of moral behaviours is being entrusted upon us by a patriarchal and a straight society which has never been accommodative towards the interest and freedom of the GAYS. Thereon, I continued doing 'strange mistakes' knowingly and unknowingly which has always created problems for me and often made me a laughing stock in front of the others which also includes conforming GAYS, who feels very proud of the high ethical standards that they have inherited from the straight society by default. But I, to my agony continue to rebel and then to suffer. I think there is a need for new social norms which shall be accommodative to the interests of a QUEER society. Please give your suggestions ?</p>
<h1>GCI- Suppose you adopt a son in future with your partner(lets say hypothetically) and your son does the same with you that you did with your dad, would you let it proceed to new heights or would you be concerned? Moral behaviors are not entrusted upon us. We choose them. We have to make sure what is right and what is wrong for us in a particular situation. Sometimes backing off is a right thing. And also, if you repeat the same mistake again, it will be a choice and not a mistake because you didn't learn from it once. Therefore it is not bad to learn from your mistakes and to mend yourself so that you don't appear as a fool in the eyes of others for silly things.</h1>
