<p>GCI doing great job here helping ppl who need any guidance
this is really very important to me gci, plz post it</p>
<p>m 23 yrs old btm guy n i have been in relationship since 2 months n in starting everything was very good. he was attracted to me both emotionally n physically, i started to feel that this is the guy of my life n i 'm' loving him from d bottom of my heart
he is bisexual n he has a girlfriend, he him self told me about it, he says he has to maary one day in his life due to his parents pressure so why not wid d girl who loves him
he says he s not attracted to girls much</p>
<p>we belongs to same city, so we used to meet every night n it was so amazing to me n i was never happier before. then we went on a holy day n had sex and things changed drastically!
before this incident, he used to call me everyday n after that he avoids my calls n give irrational explanation. i have to think on all d matters including sex i dont think that its bcos sex, cos he looked very satisfied after that
i asked him directly that even if u wanna finish this relationship then its ok but he says he dont finish this and yet he dont contact me for 3-3 days
i dont understand what to do</p>
<p>plz help me guys m really confused n ruining my career cos m thinking all d day about him n i think m gonna loose both my career n him</p>
<p>thank u in advance</p>
<h1>GCI- Use and throw alert! Bisexuality doesn't mean that a person is allowed to cheat in a relationship. Now before anyone jumps on the wagon of biphobia, cheating is something that some people do regardless of sexuality. Bisexuals are not the only one.</h1>
<p>You have to change your thinking too. If you are not a partner sharing type, then you should have stayed away from the beginning. Maybe you knew it from the beginning that he was gonna get married, you should have thought that there was no future for you both together. He played the safe game. </p>
<p>What you have to do is to take your stand. You don't have to wait for his call to move on. Think about you. Worry about you. If you continue this, he will come back, talk in a romantic way, you will get your hopes up, have sex with you, and forget about you for days. The circle will continue until you become numb and frustrated from life. Break the circle now and be happy or regret it later. You choice.</p>
