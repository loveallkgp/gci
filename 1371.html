<p>Hi everyone out der.. Hope u guys having fun.. dis s my life&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From childhood i developed craving for friendship and love. During my primary schooling I used to love my friends a lot, Especially a guy whom i considered as my blood friend. I used to save coins and used to call him daily on phone from public booth. At d end of conversation he used to give a me tele kiss and this used to make my day. Days passed and i was so addicted to his love tat i started writing his name in an 100 pages handwriting book and daily he used to sign it.. But these things not lasted for many days. My other classmates informed my class teacher abt my craze love for him. Den teacher called me and asked me whether Am i A GAY? . Tats d first tym i heard tat word. Later Teacher planned and asked my friend to end friendship wid me as they thought tat my over concern might affect his life.. And so my first Best friend/Love left me and i became alone. :( Den later during my class 12th i came across a tenant whom i started loving. We used to go for temple daily . I still remember his first kiss to me. But dis wasnt for much tym. We shifted our home and he didnt contact me later.Der after Another friend entered my life , he fell over me for my frienship even though i had made up my mind to not to have close friends anymore. But he showed me so much care tat i fell for him. We were going on long drives . . But for my bad fate, he came across a gal and he started loving her. I supported his love coz i just wanted his life long friendship.But later he started avoiding me, scolding me for simple reasons.I left my self respect and begged him for his friendship and care. But nothing worked out. Now he is so stubborn tat he wont listen to my words anymore.
Here i wanted to mention tat All so called friends extracted every work from me. I supported all of them both financially and morally wen dey wer depressed. But none responded to my feelings. Every tym wen i approached dem to reveal my true self, dey never had tym to listen to my words, my problems. So i finally decided to live a secret life. But its hard to lead dis double life. Thrice in a week i wil get depressed for d same. I Cant come out and be myself coz my parents are too orthodox. If i come out i fear for this selfish society. I mean this whole world is selfish. Even dis gay world only needs sex . No one needs true love;Both heterosexual world and gay world. No values for real love and concern. I just started hating d people around me. I cant just convince myself abt d fact tat i started becoming a MISANTHROPE. If so happen , d cause for my misanthropy is dis world. </p>
<h1>Viv- It all happens when you don't control your emotions and always fall for the wrong people who cannot be with you. Among all the darkness there is indeed a ray of light that will seek its way. Just stick to that hope and one day you will surely see it, for when darkness comes there is a sign that it will be ended soon.</h1>
