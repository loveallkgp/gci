<p>I met a gay at Grindr, initially he texted me over there out of the blue. I replied with utmost manners. Then we exchanged numbers and he was made clear, that I needed a serious relationship, at the earliest.
After we exchanged words in WhatsApp, I eventually came to know that he used a fake image to introduce himself. I acknowledged him peacefully. He, initially, was afraid of my behaviour but I made it certain that I don't really go by faces.
He is pursuing engineering in HIT and I'm pursuing simple graduation in chemistry. I gave him enough space in my life and we personally met each other too. Whereas he had a different perspective of life and I see the different way. Both our choices actually vary in a way or the other.
He though have a sporty physique and I don't have a chiseled body. He bullies his juniors whereas I uplift their confidence any many more.
These days where I have developed a soft corner for him, 'tis visible that he dodges my attention.
I'm feeling gloomy. What to do I don't know. He initially was interested in me, sang me some songs but now he goes offline in the middle of the chats, talks less frequently, comments on my interests and things as such.
Does he wish to move out?
Usne bataya main Jana chahun fir v Jane mat dena..
its my first relationship.
I'm lost. Help</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay let me breakdown his character for you. He is like those guys, who have a sense of ego about them that they are superior. From there, the attitude of being a bully comes. When bullying is concerned, there is some sense of insecurity deep within that they have to continuously try to forget by being mean t others.</h1>
<p>If a person is of this very nature, they like to get attention as well. He has it from you, but is now insecure whether he wants to take things forward with you or not. The fear of being seen as he really is, is troubling him. There might be something else as well which is harder to guess. </p>
<p>He has to take his fear out and spill it in front of you, so that you can understand him better. And this can be done if you both have spent some time with each other. It comes with trust. You have to be compassionate with him, if he allows it. In the meantime, don't be too much pushy. That can scare him away.</p>
