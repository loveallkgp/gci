<p>so here i go .. m 26 n invested my 5 years of life in a relationship, we live together since 4 years.n i love him a lot bt sm days before he asked me for going to gay party, i denied because i m not a party person while he is kinda opposite, and he told me he is going his friend place because of his son's first birthday but he lied! bcz he confessed to me that us din wo gay party me gaya tha :/ n itna hi nhi ek rich bande ne use approach kia n he had sex with him at his place that night n his excuse was he was heavily drunk , God knows man may be he charged from him too :( .. he said he cant take this guilt anymore  n he is very guilty .. n forgive me bla bla bla i love u so much.. i wont do it again.. he is doing every possible thing to say sorry from holding ears to getting on his knees bt m ignoring .. my heart wants to forgive him bt i cant.. n i wont.. m not a saint mahatma that i vll forgive me fr making this blunder, yesterday he went to 2 hours distance just to bring my favorite kababs n i left that i did nt eat .. i m feeling really bad whn i do this but m not overreacting , i gt hurted a lot a lot means a lot! i always fulfill his all demands evn if m not in mood :( still he did this.. wt should i do.m plzzz help .. he is guilty i know.. n i cant see him lyk that , i try to forget bt i cant... help me out m very depressed..</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm..so ur bf made out after the party...but he loves u too as well...or maybe he don't have a control on his urges and desires for other men....As I see the case he seems to be a nice guy but is a polygamist i guess or an opportunist...some gaymen have that male ego of not letting go of the hooked fish..Other points to be considered are-</h1>
<p>1- He maybe a polygamist but maybe a true lover too.
2- He maybe still in that immature phase of carnal desires v/s the true emotions.
3- U might not even know that he might be cheating on u oftenly.
4- If u think that U can understand him in all the aspects then talk it out that what drives him to go for this stuff and talk it like real matured GAYMEN...which i m disappointed as mostly we are not.</p>
