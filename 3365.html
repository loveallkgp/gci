<p>hello friends I am a straight guy but I support LGBT community very much but recently I have been going through a problem I thought I may not be able to tell this to anyone, so writing here, I have met a girl recently she is a lesbian but then she fell for me, we had intimate time together and we were in a months relationship but after that she started to ignore me, I am very emotional and soft hearted person, I loved her so much and even cried for her many time, I just don't understand why she left me, so I asked her and her response was so biased then we decided to stay friends but after a while she started to depart even from friendship now I have blocked her but I just can not get over her thoughts. Recently I saw a picture of her showing her back to everyone in her picture, I got really heart broken and never expected that she could show this to anyone but me..... :( :(  I really loved her companion. </p>
<h1>gci- That is why I say that whenever any gay person goes for a straight relation, it never works out.</h1>
