<p>I am in a casual relationship with a guy whom I met four months ago through grindr, we meet quite often. Although I am very fond of him and I think he is too(of me I mean, though he is quite narcissistic too), but I think it's too early to say that we are in love. The problem is that when he is not around I have so many fantasies that I will do this with him and that with him, but I feel I get very shy and awkward when he is with me and sometimes we don't even have sex and just do time pass when we meet (although I love passing time with him but passing time next to his nude body is always better) . It's something like 'milo na tum to hum ghabarayein milo to ankh churaen hume kya ho gaya Hai' .</p>
