<p>Hy everyone...
M disappointed coz of my relationship....
Brodly speaking... I have a relationship with a guy since 1 year....
I loved him so much...
He was my world..my heatbeats...my everything...
And i was believing that he loves me more than i love him....
But i was wrong...
He cheated me...
He was in love with another guy...
I caught out them having romance together...
My world got dissipeted...
My all happiness screwed...
I couldn't sleep many nights with tears in my eyes... And now m writing this story,this time m also crying...
But i can't leave him,coz he means to be everything to me...my reason to live...
After some time i found a guy from fb that have feeling just like me abd we become friends...
I told my story to him and he also told me his story....
As we both were broken hearted..we becomes best friends...
The days were going fastly and one day he proposed me....
And i dont know why i accepted...
Yes i love the first guy so much and cant leave him but i dont know why i accepted...
But further i feel guilt...
I think i was doing wrong with my love...
But i was thinking the first guy has cheated me,so why cant i??
But then i realised that i love him a lot and cant cheat him inspite of he hurted me so many times....
And i cant keep the second guy happy or cant bear the hurts that the first guy given to me...
And i decided to broke up with the second guy...
Because i feel that i cant cheat him...i love him a lot...inspite of he hurted me, he was my life...
Now plz guys, suggest me what should i do???????</p>
<h1>GCI- Sometimes its ready to leave the past and make a new move. You can't cheat on him with someone else? Isn't he already history? I guess you should have given the second guy some chance. Although, you shouldn't use someone to fill the void in your life. Let the void heal on itself and then find someone new to be happy with.</h1>
