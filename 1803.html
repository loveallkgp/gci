<p>im a straight guy and im very creative so I decided to go into fashion designing.  but my parents nd relatives are saying ki fashion designing to gay log krte h .. huh I mean seriously?<br>
fashion ka sexuality se kya mstlb?  </p>
<p>$ABBY : omg.. ! me too doing fashion designing . i am blunt person and my parents firstly denied but later they agreed saying if u like it you shall do it. my relatives fear me more ..</p>
<p>and believe me there are very less gay men in fashion institute. mostly there are girls and 3 or 4 if lucky then maybe 5 guys . i can declare there are 14 guys in whole sections and maybe two guys are gay ( including me ) rest have gf's. and its still hard to see a gay guy here... you can find more in engineering college or any other college .... its just a myth that only gay men do fashion designing ..though its reality that many gay men are creative and have love for fashion and they go to fashion design as people here are more acceptable .</p>
