When i told him clearly then he start chanting i love u i love u like mad for nearly 50 times. And said that ohk if u cant accept me its fyn just put me in your flat for months i cant live at that place. M STAying alone and hv a decent job i can put him in my flat but it may lead to complications? so i denied. he cried a lot that day n finally i drop him nearby his house. since then m ignoring him :( i dont love him but i really care for him. i did nt tell my bf about this! m feeling so bad hurting him.i hv blocked hm from everywhere.. but kiddo i like you n miss your cute antics, u were like a little bro to me. but its better for both of us to end it here :) i knw u must be missing me too .. but life is bigger thn this work hard n get into decent college :) thats oll i wanted to say if you are reading this! l</p>
