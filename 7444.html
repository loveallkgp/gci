<p>I don't understand why I have to go through these embarrassing situations. I have a gorgeous &amp; pretty girl as my friend. We are exact copies of each other, except for I'm a guy. We study together, have fun together, abuse each other(she's tomboy types) and share our hearts to each other. Many people are after her. And they think I am dating her, lol :D. I am always fucked up. So to fix this, I became her brother ;), although she refused for rakhi :P, and otherwise too, I have really  <em>hot</em> girls as my friend, and I cant love them, except being their best friend. I am not actually looking for love right now, yet I get those things in life, which doesn't have anything to do with me(girls here, for eg.). Guys are straight everywhere, and I cant mess up with them(I don't want to, I have a haunting past). I don't know if I am comfortable or sad being gay, because it hurts. I am strong, of course, we all are, but a human too, and there's no one whom I can hug and cry when I want to. Sorry for making this sober, but this is my story. I sometimes wish, 'kaash mai gay na hota..... <em>sigh</em>'</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you can wish for anything in the world but you have got to accept what you are and be done with the wishes for something that is out of your hands. As for that daunting past, you can explain us what went wrong and how you feel about it. Maybe we can try with each other to find out the root cause and maybe after it you will feel okay. I am no expert but I have dealt with situations like these in the past.</h1>
