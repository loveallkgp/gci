<p>Date - 11th April 2015,
Location - Islampur, sangli district, Maharashtra.</p>
<p>I has many friend from this ID, I met a guy on 11th april, 2pm. We watched movie together, had dinner in a very famous hotel, situated near NH4 highway(pune-banglore)....at around 10.30pm we both left the hotel, he was riding bike &amp; i was behind eating icecream. He stopped, told me to stood up, i did, &amp; he kissed me. That was awesome, at around 11 pm, on road side we were kissing. Suddenly a car came &amp; light strokes our faces, 3 guys came down of car &amp; grabbed us :(, they started abusing in local marathi language. Beat us. I was crying &amp; my partener were trying to be free. They were making fun of us. When my partner gave them money &amp; requested to make us free, they said 1st fuck ur friend. :( else they gonna share our pic on whtsapp :'( we didn't had any option &amp; yes we had sex in front of them :'( blood all over my pants, paining.I dnt knw what happened.But wont meet any1  </p>
<h1>GCI- Why didn't you complain to the police about the harassment? No one had any proof of you guys having sex, you could have gone and said that a bunch of guys mugged you and beat you up! Take a help of any NGO if you can. Don't be a victim please.</h1>
