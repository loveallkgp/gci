<p>I very well know that the Admins of this page are very choosy to post confessions but still I request u the admins of this page to Please  post this confession as this confession can be eye opening:- </p>
<p>I had a very good friend during my college days we both were in the same batch and we both were bottom gays I m still now .. He was a kind of a guy who was very sensitive , friendly , outgoing , very emotional kind of a guy . He was dating someone since 3 months then ...  I being his best friend tried my best to know about this guy who he had been dating since 3 months but unfortunately he did not share any of his secrets with me ... his unfortunate sad story was later exposed in his suicide letter .... his story was like this :- </p>
<p>My friend sid ( name changed ) met Rahul ( name changed ) in a gay dating app ...  Rahul was a bisexual and sid was a gay . Sid being completely unaware of Rahul's sexual orientation he started going out on a date with him and one fine day they made love and there was no looking back then on wards .. ...Rahul had an elder bro called Manish ( name changed )  who was married then and even had 2 children  .... Manish very cleverly traced out  Rahul's love life and started torturing sid to make love with him as well . It was later exposed that Manish had a video of Rahul and sid making love and on the basis of that video Manish blackmailed Sid to have sex with him . Sid was forced to have sex with Manish, sid was raped by Manish for like a month and when sid tried to share this matter with rahul , rahul stated that ( mien or Manish bachpan se sab kuch share karthe are hai , agar mera bhai mere boyfriend k sath sex karna Chatha hai tho ismein problem kiya hai ) Knowing the fact that his brother was married and he even had 2 children out of that marriage he allowed his brother to rape his boyfriend... and he never took any  actions against his brother neither he stood for his boyfriend and supported him .Sid stopped talking to me , he started ignoring , he was depressed and scared to share his emotions with anyone out of fear of shame and defame . He did not share his problems with anyone and finally he decided to kill himself .. he wrote his pain in that letter which was exposed to this world ....  I tried my best to understand him , to pull his towards me and ask him what was eating his peace . But I failed ... I failed to be a good friend ...  and finally his death went in vain no action serious  was taken .. ... now tell me will u all still trust bisexuals    ?? .... the man who was married and even had 2 lovely children he raped my friend ... .. it's a shame man ... it's a big shame</p>
<h1>GCI- I am sorry about whatever happened to your friend, if it was real.</h1>
<p>But the judgment wants to doubt the entire context of the confession. The last two lines took out the essence of the sensitivity and went on to the blaming part against bisexuals.</p>
<p>Not to be insensitive, but it is pretty dumb the way you wrote it. If you don't want the admins to be rude to you, don't post your silly judgments again and again. We both have tried to reason it out with you, but you never listened. </p>
<p>One last thing before I start banging my head (because the wall looks delicious), all of these confessions that I posted today were from you. If you want to have a healthy discussion about insecurities, internalized homophobia, and behaviour with other people, I will be more than interested in that. But if you choose to ignore whatever we say and come out with the same context again and again, there will be a point where we will not be able to take it.</p>
