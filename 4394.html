<p>We are from chowringee area. We both are normal but think our third roomate is gay. How to confirm it. He doesnt talk much about girls boobs and hides when we watch pondy. He also is senti like girls. He also has his own circle. We saw suggestion online to secretly tape the bed room and see if he has male sex. But he doesnt bring any friend home. We are really scared. We cant roam shirtless or be alone with him bcoz of this doubt. How to confirm if someone is a half male</p>
<h1>GCI- Sometimes confessions like these makes me want to put a tape on the brains of people like the confessor. Either the confession is a troll and fake, or the confessor is being really an ignorant slob.</h1>
<p>Anyways,
1) If he is gay, he is normal. To him you can be abnormal.
2) His private life is none of your concern. Stop poking in his life.
3) Making a video of someone or recording someone's private moments is a crime if you do not know. You are hereby confessing it also. Do you know something called IP tracking? Next time if you do it, do not confess something like this. 
4) Why do straights feel scared with gays? Apne aap ko badi hoor pari samajti hai jo wo tere pe chadhega?
5) You are hereby proved to be half intelligent.</p>
<p>Have a nice life.</p>
