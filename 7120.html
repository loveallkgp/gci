<p>Hello All
I am a 28 years old very good looking n decent educated and cultured guy from Jammu and I am very confused these days...actually I cant decide what I actually want and what I am looking for in Life.......... It goes like when I was some 15 years  old to some 20 years of age I had a liking for girls and keep on masturbating thinking of a girl and loved watching porn too But slowly as I got 21 I developed this liking for guys by watching porn and I started liking macho guys with thick n juicy cocks and then dated many a guys and I liked giving them all a blow job and liked getting my nipples sucked by them but as This all was going on and I was calling guys out of excitement at my place and when they were offering their dicks to me to suck I had this feeling in my mind that why I am sucking someone ..... I dont want to suck a cock as I am a guy so I kept on sucking them without any Mood or refuse to suck ...again When I look a gud looking guy I just wished If I can get his tool to suck ....I DONT KNOW WHAT IS THIS SIMULTANEOUS FEELING ........ I DONT WANT TO SUCK and I WANT TO SUCK TOO ....... Though  I am not in to anal Sex ...... Please Explain what am I ??? Am I a bottom or vers guy or I am bisexual guy ?? This confusion is keeping me away from the decision of getting married too ??? Please if somebody can counsel ............. I need you genuine advice </p>
<h1>GCI- OK time for counselling.</h1>
<p>1- U may have bisexual tendencies or maybe a bit fluid but not exclusively bi or gay.
2- U have entrenched 'patriarchal thoughts' when u say u cannot suck because u r a MAN.
3- U need to let go of your gender construction of male, masculinity and prejudicial and discriminating thoughts against your very own self.
4- U need to understand that sexuality is a part of u to decide yourself not be tagged by us or anyone else.
5- U need to throw away labels of bottom, top, versatile or whatsoever bcoz that has marred ur growth as a queer guy.
6- U need to understand that gay, bi guys can suck, get sucked, fuck or vice versa and enjoy their unique sexuality in any way they want.
7- U need to be at peace with ur sexuality because at the end of the day our body knows what it wants, how it wants, when it wants and why it wants.
8- U must also understand the fact that it is not problem but ur psychological state of living with cognitive dissonance where u allow yourself to live with inconsistent contradictory thoughts.
9- Break free from your thoughts and establish new ones with new understanding. U will not ask us anything again on the same.</p>
