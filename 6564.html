<p>Dear brothers,</p>
<p>To start with, not any confession as such, but felt good to share few of my experiences. Almost regular follower of confessions and posted few from a Facebook Id which I had created specially for GCI. I felt quiet reliable and safe this time to post from my genuine FB id. 
Recently I attended pride parade here in Israel in June 2015. It was a mixed crowd, even with children brought by their parents, of more than 1.5 lakhs of which around 50k were foreigners. For the first time I closely saw people who are proud for whom they are and felt ashamed of myself. Met same sex couples who are married for years or living together for ages, beautiful LGBT bands/singers, all lovely and loving people, cheek-to-cheek kisses, hugs, all mesmerized me.  I never knew that strangers can be loved so much. Sometimes I spend sometime with myself at the Mediterranean beaches/G-beach, sometimes I go to G-pubs and meet couples who have worked hard together for years to have their own house, to make their own home. It fills my heart. I believe that we can inculcate such mentality in our country. We don't need to come out, I understand there is a fine line between bravery and stupidity, but we can spread love not only on bed but also among our hearts. Seeing these nice people here, sometimes I feel lonely, and my heart fills with love and affection for someone unknown with whom I interact only in my dreams. I have always wanted to have my other half from my own country. Have been loved uniquely by many, I loved them back, but never found one on whose arms I can die smiling at his face. Some loved my eyes, some loved my youthful skin, some loved the way I communicate, some loved my goals and achievements, some loved my view towards life, but no one loved my soul, my own self. We are so confused about what we want in life. I know I am doing well in my profession, working hard to uplift human race from hunger and illiteracy, but still at the end of the day I search for one's shoulder. I don't want to see the entire world in him, neither I want him to because we all like each other for the world they belong to, but a mutual support, understanding and love. I wish to get married in United States, have our own child by surrogacy and bring him/her up with a modern outlook. Guys, you know what, we all need love and for that we need to love ourselves in the first place. WE GAYS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL</p>
<h1>GCI- "we all need love and for that we need to love ourselves in the first place." AMEN FOR THAT!</h1>
