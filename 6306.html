<p>I was browsing fb <em>real id</em> few months ago and i got message from this guy. Hey u r vry hot and my teenage crush since an year. And we start chatting and o gosh i was very tired bt he built a really interesting convo from flirt to philosophical to bollywood to witty n sarcastic and i enjoyed that much that i spend nearly 5 hours just chatting to him without getting bored when in midst i ask for pic he ignored.And end the convo saying that if u ever miss me just text me.. and when i feel sad i text him and i feel really good :) when i ask for pic he said i m telling u that i m ugly and i dont wanna disappoint u and we r not going to meet ever and one more thing i start chatting wd u after seeing your face so i cant really expect that u will try to see me internally chuck it! and start chatting normally as if nothing has happened! He dont text me first i always do.Ya m gud looking (not showing off) n i really dont care how he looks in friendship or even in rlnship. I hv had sex with many lookers in these 4 years and fed up with it now.Want something stable and at the end of the day he makes me smile n makes me forget my boring/stressful day it makes me feel contended.Plz guys help me how to ask him to share his pic even m ready fr blind date too but how to insists him for meeting..I m typing here bcz many guys may think like him here plz advice ..:)</p>
<h1>GCI- So tell him what you really think then. Make him believe that. Try to bring him out of his insecure shell.</h1>
