<p>Hey guys
I wanted to share something about my life with you all. It was those days when I worked for money to sustain myself in any way possible by being intimate with people. I came across some people who left an impression on my mind with their words. I will not explain what I used to do and I least bother about the judgmental pricks in my life. That night when I went to that guy he on the next day while I was leaving, told me that I am a very decent person and he would have loved to be my boyfriend. I was flattered a bit but he knew what my answer would be. Nevertheless, life was on its track and somehow it happened that I had to go to a person and be encountered with some real hard facts. He was a teacher in his initial 30s. He was hunch-backed, but fairly good looking enough and very gentle to talk to. That evening I had a conversation with him after the failure of fuck session( yes he wanted to get fucked), due to non availability of a condom. The kind of words that came from his mouth seemed like he was waiting for someone like me to pour his life which he was hiding from the world. He had a bf in college and they were pretty happy with each other. One fine day, during their fest he went to the third floor which was under construction and there was water spilled on the marble stairs. While descending the stairs hurriedly (I can guess the reason) both of them fell down. After a fortnight he opened his eyes in the hospital. 
Everyone had come but he waited for him to come or talk and he was angry that everyone had come except him. When he asked the doctor about his whereabouts, the doctor replied, he died on the next day both of you arrived in the hospital.
That moment I saw him in a state of trance like condition. But he tried to divert the topic by saying that he doesn't know why is he telling me all this, but I insisted. 
He revealed that he was his senior and had failed just to be with him in the college and was about to get into a job.
When I left his house, I decided not to go back to his place because I somehow felt his sharp tinge of sombre and I just couldn't bear.
I saw his pics in his youth, he was really a dashing young man in his time and now his deframed body and not having a single picture of his boyfriend spoke of the loss he had gone through. Yes, not even a single pic.
I want to tell those people who hire people for sex that we are also human beings and we also feel the same pain, maybe sometimes more than you.</p>
