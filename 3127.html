<p>My boyfriend learnt the had way that he should stop drinking. There was a time when he got so high and knocked my house every night at around 1 or 2. He called for night stay and he disappears with his friends for drinks. One day he called for night stay and i was unwell suffering from high fever. He reached home late night and was almost about to black out. He vomited and i had to clean up, change his clothes and make him sleep. Whole night I could not sleep and sat in the couch. I had enough of it. Next night he woke up and apologized but I didn't listen to him and I was pretty weak and tired. He grabbed my hand and started abusing me. I was so weak that when he pushed against the wall i fainted; he rushed me to the hospital and took care of me. That happened 1.5 years ago and i was diagnosed with calcium deficiency. That was the time and now its has changed. Although I've been through so much. Had emancipated from my family and all but I never gave up from inside. Although I was broken many times but now he has changed and i can assure that if you don't give up something might change. But do remember if he abuses too much leave him. Now I'm happy and we both are working and recently bought a flat in Gurgaon. :) If you believe on something never give up ! </p>
