<p>"breaking stereotypes about transvestite and transexual"
The vast majority of male transvestites like being men. They do not feel they are women trapped in male bodies and they have no desire to become female by taking hormones or having surgery to remove their male genitals.In contrast, men who are uncomfortable about being male, or who feel they are not male inside, are said to have gender dysphoria.Dysphoria means a chronic feeling of discontent.If this unhappiness and discomfort at being male leads them to take steps to change gender, they are then called transsexuals.Some women also have gender dysphoria and seek to change sex, but they are a tiny minority of transsexuals.
transvestite-- homosexual male crossdressers are called transvestite this people are quite androgynous..
Transsexual - An older term originating from medical and psychological communities referring to transgender. Some people prefer the term transgender to transsexual, while some definitions make a distinction between the two. While the term transsexual implies that the person almost always wishes to undergo a gender-affirmative surgery, some use transgender as just an umbrella term. a transexual can be hetrosexual or homosexual or bisexual.</p>
