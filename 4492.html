<p>Hi Admin,
I posted a confession(#4461) the other day. I appreciate all the positive feedback from you. Thanks a lot. I just want to make clear somethings here
1. I am bisexual and have been with both sexes. I am not implying that I am going to do the same after I go for a relationship with guy. I want a monogamous relationship. Most of you have misunderstood this.
2. @Aayan Mehra I am not abuser. It was consensual sex with girls and those girls were aware that it was just sex. I was not using them. It was mutual decision. So please, don't judge anybody without knowing the story behind it.
3. Many guys, like me, spill their guts out here just to seek some advice and guidance. So don't be the moral police for them. There are plenty of them in the society already. We are vulnerable when we tell someone about things that are so close to our hearts. So be sympathetic and sensitive towards it. But please avoid to utter absolute nonsense.
4. I have been able to convince my parents to be on my side. Hope girl's side don't create problems for me.
5. Not all bisexual guys are sex seekers and not all sex seekers guys are bisexuals. I don't want to be with a person who can't be loyal in relationship. I don't want to create any utopia let alone bisexual. No relationship is perfect but we have to try to make it closer to perfect.
6.Don't judge people based on their sexuality. I don't why people start judging others especaillay bisexuals, trangenders, effeminate gays. Who are you to judge others? Live and let live.
Sorry if I have offended anyone. This is my last post and you guys won't hear from me again. I am better off without the hatred.
Keep fighting among yourselves, if that's what you want. And Indian laws would be same even after decades.
Sorry admin. You are really nice, sophisticated person and I salute your efforts. But most guys here don't even know how to keep their personal issues aside on a public platform.
Thank you.
Peace</p>
