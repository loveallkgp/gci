<h1>Ash 19,</h1>
<p>Most of us her have fake accounts.
But the fact is, we are fake on our so called real account. Here we cheat people, break heart and expose our sexuality, we expose for sex greed and a need of companion. Here we have very successful homosexual love life. This is our reality.
How is this possible that we are fake with the fake account.?
Actually we are real with the fake account. People show goodness and even cheapness straight away, because this is us and that our reality.
Few are here who don't have a strength in their dignity and fall to the cheapest level. Because of such people we are takes as "all are equal".
On the so called real account we fake flirt with girls, those try to be very nice but they are not.
Sexuality is hidden and many dark sides are not exposed, How can we say, that is the real account??
I mean to say that facebook accounts are note fake/real. That's us, who pretend to be someone else.</p>
