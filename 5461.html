<p>Dear admin, i have a bit of a problem. He had been my highschool teacher. I got a liking to him. Then love. It goes for about 2years. Then last year i got hs no.through facebook. I messge hm. Right from the begining i told him of my love for him. For quite some day he took me as a women. Then atlast i cnfess'd iam a guy. He said nothing abusive than expectd. Instead askd for my identity. Saying he'd understand and keep it a secret. I told him not. Just saying people wil knw me someday of who iam when iam well establish myself. Then atlast he called me by my name. I was realy2 bustd, stunt and i made a scene quite somehow scaring the wits out of my friends. What could this mean? Had he been aware of my attraction to him? He also mention''busted u r the guy i met last december'' when i told hm iam a boy. When he cald me by my name i didnt reply hm back til today. And iam going home next year. So what do i do? What's his instinct? Suggest me please!!! All suggest are welcome from our psychiatrist out there too. Help me as a gay brethren.</p>
<h1>GCI- It's just that he is secretly seeing the guys himself. Moreover as you are now out of high school, this thing shouldn't bother you. I still am not able to get the hang of the issue so I really don't know what is going on and what should I say.</h1>
