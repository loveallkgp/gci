<h1>GCI- Breaking up a friendship because his parents said so might be the stupidest excuse I have ever heard. There can be many reasons that why he did that. Maybe he fall for you but didn't want to be with you. Maybe he got a bf and his bf didn't want any gay friends around. Maybe he didn't consider you that good friend as you considered him to be. I will go with the last one as an answer to your question.</h1>
