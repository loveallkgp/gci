<p>hey admin and all the guys...
i want to ask u some thing
i met a guy near my house on fake id. he is bisexual too.He is top n m bottom. After some time together we spent in evening on bike together and eating together, i develpoed strong feelings for him. i like him alot. but he is self obsessed and give full are to himself only n i do sm thing to grasp sm attention , to make me feel i m important too thn he said y i m behaving like a girl? some time it looks like he is using me for his expenses on suppliments and chicken. Since m nt earning ryt now so it become difficult for me to handle it. but thing is dat i like him alot.i like to spend time wid him but after i spend time wid him i realise dat it is totally waste ...he has no interest in relationship. he knows about my feelings very well.
wat shud i do ?
i just love him.</p>
<h1>GCI- Yeah, I am not sure if I'd call it love. It's kind of a weird thing that humans do to get something that's out of reach. That is what you are doing. And you are being foolish for running after him. He is using you and you are getting used. Just get out of this thing.</h1>
