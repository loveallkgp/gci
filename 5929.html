<p>Hey friends how are you Whats going on friends why we are messing around between masculine and famine gays we both are sides of a coin. Why donot we work for our lgbt community instead of working together we are quarreling with each other. Straight and homophobic and orthodox people want that we should not unite so that we can't get our rights and live freely with our partners. Every male has a famine side once in his life he tries a female clothes wether you all acept or deny but uts the truth for fufil your fantasy u have used femine clothes. I am a masculine guy from my looks nobody can judge that i have a feminine side that i cross dress and behave like girls some time thinks like girls. We should respect ourselves help each other. People's from our group are not supporting each other how can we get our rights from state Pl guys use your common sense Being feminine is not choice its harmonal its not a disease its genes that god has gifted us</p>
