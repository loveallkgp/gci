<p>Hi folks! Gm to all I'm new here and in starting only I met a guy from delhi who also had joined fb recently. We started chat, he told he was cheated over by a guy and so joined fb. In a day only he asked for relationship...I accepted, though we in long distance. After exactly 3 days his fb was updated with another relationship status with other guy. I congratulated him and paid a gud bye to him. Same day in night he called, looked kinda stressed and said to forgive him for all that, it was a mistake. Ok, 1st mistake.. I forgave him. We started calling texting every hour and this made me attached with him. Again after a week he did same. But he denied saying it is by him. Uff...ok. No contacts from my side for 2 days, his friend called me to forgive him. I again did coz he said in roza he don't lie. Last day his I'd was missing from my profile, said he deleted and at the same time updated relationship status with another and blocked me. I checked this from another profile. Omg!! What a guy here. I wanna show him his real face. How?</p>
<h1>GCI- What a creep... It would be best for you to let that dramatic ass hoe to go wherever he wants. It is good that he is gone from your life for good.</h1>
