<p>Thanks for yur comments freinds.. </p>
<p>Sequel of confession #7441</p>
<p>I used to see him a lot. His height and body is extremly good. Days rolled on like that, my room mates were thought of changing the room and I asked my love to join with us in our new room. To my suprise he said ok, I was on the cloud nine, dono wat to do.
After a week, we shifted to our new room, my love chosen a bed ryt next to me.Cant express my happiness during that time. I dono whether he is in love with me or just randonly doing things, whatever it is I have my love sleeping next to me and got more time to see him. OMG!!! what a face and smile he is having, it could kill u without a knife. I gone mad on him. One nyt I noticed he was watching porn vedios (straight vedios) on his mobile and noticed his dick was too erected, immediately he went to rest room and taken the cum out. He came out and seen whether anyone noticed him, i was hide myself under the bedsheet. Seriously i could not able to sleep at all on that nyt. On one side was happy that i seen his erected dick but other hand was having a thought he myt be straight.  Days passed away with confussion.
One nyt everyone in the room went to native only my love and myself was staying, he was sleeping ryt next to me. Somehow got the courage to touch his dick, that time also it was too big and started to kiss him on his lips.My god, I thought he was sleeping, but he didnt. He hugged me tightly with his rough hand and without saying a single word he kissed me all over my body. And we started the foreplay, he was too good in kissing and thats all I lost my virginity to my love. After we woke up in the morning, he asked innoru time chellakutty? (Once more darling) with his cute smile, how could I say no to that cute smiley. He started to take care me lot with his messages, calls and ofcourse LOVE. We were madly in love with each other, I used to wash his clothes and iron them, I cooked for him, alomost we lived like a couples. We did sex often. I thanked god for giving him to ma life. Life was going smoothly, he came to me asked shall v get marry my dear?. Tears were rolled on my cheeks, little bit hesitation also there. How two boys wil get marry and how the society will see us. But, beyond that, i dont want to loose my love. I said okay. Once again he killed me with his smile and taken me to his bedroom. .
Finally, the bad has came to ma life. My love said, no this is not fair buddy. we are doing something wrong, I dono how i did this with you. Lets stop all things here and be my good friend. My heart was broken into too many pieces not able to hear his words and also dono what to reply. I was standing like a statue. A guy who rejected his transfer in office because of me, a guy took care of me like ma parents, a guy who gave me a life which i want to live for long time. Now, the same guy is rejecting ma LOVE and ask to be his jus frnd. I said ok and moved on, but not able to forgot him. Out of my mind i started black mailing him, if yu are not loving me, i will die or cut my hand like this... I know, thats the peak of stupidity, but I was blindly love on him. Because of this my love started to hate me. He asked me to leave from the room permantly. I left with heavy heart, Its been 4 years from that day, I tried to talk with him and say sorry for my stupid behaviour, but he blocked me in all the social network. But still, I am sending my wishes to his birthday through post. He is the only guy in my mind, I dono why he thrown me away. But i wish him all the success and happy life ahead...</p>
<p>Note: My english is pathetic only, pls bare with that and the lines above are true, no copy &amp; paste. Thanks for your time friends..</p>
<h1>GCIL- Now don't do this next time and block him as well.</h1>
<p>What u did was stupid and wrong and not justified.....LOVE never demands, it only gives and it is not blind, it is bruised most of the times, that is why it hurts in love.</p>
