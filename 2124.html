<p>hay, some people says that homosexuality is a sin, if it is a sin then why god made us too cute, they said that god hates gays and they belive in such non sence things, bt i worried if they are correct, is god is punishing us for what we did in our previous birth?</p>
<h1>gci : NO  god doesn't punish anybody for previous birth .. or for present either . if that was the case all poor people lived happy and healthy and all the mafia , rich people lived life of guilt .</h1>
<p>secondly ..god didn't  write any book  regarding what to wear or to stay nude , regarding cutting your foreskin , regarding gays , regarding hell or heaven ... all these pathetic things were made by religious leaders to take control on people who fear . </p>
<p>gad has a well made plan . see if all the people were straight ..all of them will reproduce so much , there will be so many kids and world will become highly overpopulated . and str8 people will forget the value of kids as there will be so many ..and they will abandon them . so god made gays ..to adopt all the abandoned kids , left out kids and orphans . its nature's own method to control population blast .</p>
