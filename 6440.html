<p>I dated my ex for almost a year even though he always considered himself homoromantic bisexual.later many a times considering himself 100 % ideal heterosexual.
His image was getting spoiled becuz of seeing with me . My classmates speculated of us gay couples because eyes emit rays ,that would have given them the hint .
How did we look at each other.
Sooner to defend his image , he broke up with me and told me he would never talk to me in his entire life. I got hurt extremely badly.
Went through lots of heart cry,counselling to forget him and make myself better.
It's been almost 7 months we haven't spoken to each other except 1-2 formal talks during classes .
Ignored me a lot.
Now he wants me back. He wants I should talk to him but he seems taking me for just granted.
Even if I speak he still doesn't care for me.
Leave me all alone going with another friend.
I don't understand then why he wants to talk to me.
He has never called me never said sorry or apologized.
Left/broke up without giving any reason.
Should I stop talking to him ? </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, what do you want? You want to be with him or not? That depends upon you. Think rationally about your needs and feelings. If he wants you back, make sure you talk with him about whatever happened between you in the past and see to that he is apologizing and he is changed. If you decide to get back with him, be not weak, should he decides to leave again. Be selfish for your happiness and be open even if you hate him.</h1>
