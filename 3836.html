<p>Hi admin, i'm a 21 yr old here. Finished my College, now looking for a job. 
I knew I was different from my classmates from my high school days. They used to talk of girls, boobs, etc and I didn't feel comfortable. My basic nature was an introvert, I'm not a very social person. In college, my friends asked me why I don't have interest in girls- I made up a story about a breakup I had in school, so I hate girls. I even had a proposal from a girl in college but ignored it as I thought it wouldn't be fair to her. I hardly spoke to any girls and this made the girls think I was a very decent gentleman. I found out that I was "gay" and the feelings I had were completely normal from the internet. But I just didn't want to accept myself and hoped and prayed I'd turn straight one day. Never happened. During this time, I met guys for mutual fun, never had sex.
A few months ago, with a great help from this page, I finally accepted I'm gay. Made a lot of friends from this fake id, we even exchanged numbers and keep in touch. The initial days are lovely, we're eager to find out about each other's lives. I was so happy to find others in the same position as me. After that, it's just a general "Hi, how are you?" or " Good morning"... or sometimes just forwards. I hardly chat or message anyone- I'm happy within my bubble. This makes them think I'm arrogant and they get annoyed with me. It's just that I'm happier with myself, I usually go hours without any human contact. I read books, browse the net, listen to music or watch tv. Socialising doesn't figure on my list at all. I feel like I'm cheating them, there are others who socialise and party hard, go to malls, beaches, take a drive out- my friends are better off with them.
I do feel like I would like to be surrounded by friends especially when I see the pics they put on fb of them having fun, but I've never made an effort in that direction. Is something wrong with me? I was hoping I would get a bf and settle down, but I'm always worried what would happen if I land up with the same kind of relationship I have with friends now. It would be terribly painful to break up. My life's a mess now. My school and college friends know about my nature so they rarely contact me, they only call me for some information, etc. It's my new friends who haven't known me as long, I'm worried about. Can you please help me out?</p>
<h1>GCI- Kind of a story of my life. What I did to improve myself was to become more talkative and more interested in other people's life. Ask them what is going on in their lives, how are they doing and all that jazz. If you are interested in someone and you are showing it then only you will have a healthy relationship with someone, be it a partner or just friendship. We as humans have to be social otherwise the loneliness will get on our nerves after some time and you cannot be busy 24x7. Make a time division if possible that in a particular hour you have to talk with friend and after that you have to do your chores that please you. All the best.</h1>
