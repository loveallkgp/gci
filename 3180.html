<p>Regarding Confession #3170 </p>
<p>Same sex couples rights for adoption or surrogacy in Indian. Before section 377 was overturned same sex couple's who live in a country where same sex marriage is legal, were allowed to adopt or have a baby through surrogacy from india but now this only applies to hetrosexual couple's. Even a single guy could adopt or have a baby through surrogacy from India ( only few countries in the world allow this) single guy cant adopt or go through surrogacy process any more but i believe single girl still can. You may ask why gay couple from USA would wana go through surrogacy process in India when they can do that in USA? Well in USA surrogacy cost more then 1 lakh US dollars, in india you can get this done between 20-30 thousand US dollars. India was one of the best option for gay couple for adoption/surrogacy. If we look at the financial point of view indian goverment and the fertility clinics were making millions of dollars from these gay couple and those homeless kids were able to have a fabulous life with their fabulous gay dad's or dad and those surrogate mothers could use that money they earned to carry a baby to build a new house for her family or pay their kids school fees or save that money so she could use it to pay for her daughter's wedding in the future. It was a win-win situation for everyone. I hope when ever they pass 377 they will change this law to how it use to be. This is very important issue for not only Gay indian's who are living overseas and want to adopt from india but also for "Gora's" if the indian goverment allow single guy to adopt it will be a huge achievement for gay guys who live in india and want to be dad. We need to be more aware about these adoption/surrogacy rules and fight for them if we cant marry our bf atleast we will be able to become single dad by law. </p>
<p>P.S:- There are some video's on youtube regarding surrogacy in india. Search Gay surrogacy in india or surrogacy in india. You will find video's about overseas gay couples who have successfully had babies from india before this law was amended.</p>
<h1>GCI- That does comes as a shock. A brutal shock. What about gay couples or a single gay man who stays in India? Can they adopt or not?</h1>
