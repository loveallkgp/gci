<p>I am appalled at reading confession 2320. People seem to blame girlish guy for the bad image of gay community. even his holiness Dev singh. Guys first get few things straight </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Like you masculine guys are born to be masculine and like guys similarly us "girly" gays were born to be girly and like guys. So by taking account of this analogy no one can understand this better than you </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feminine gays are teased and bullied because their behavior (although perfectly normal) is not what society expects and they cant hide it. And what society expects does not have to be right. 40-50 years ago more than half of america was against interracial marriage or sex. Does that appear right now? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all the feminine guys in this world are eliminated (suppose say) do you really think image of the community will improve? do you really think parliament is gonna be like "oh now being gay is so cool and fashionable . lets make it legal and add some anti discriminatory laws" No this is not gonna happen. Once such situation materialize you "masculine gays" are gonna be targeted too because society will realize that you too like the aforementioned annihilated race of feminine gays do the same thing. You masculine gays too get down on your knees, take a thick cock in your mouth and sometimes take it violently in your ass too!. You too love the smell of a dick and a man's body. This is not how a straight guys behave. so do not call yourself straight acting..EVER </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.We feminine gays do not hurt anyone. We stay in our little world, going about our daily chores. The problem creators are these "straight" people who do not let us live our life the way we are supposed to be. so if you wanna blame someone they are the culprit </p>
<p>5.Finally with us feminine gay guys or without, u too will be persecuted,tortured,raped,bullied killed just like we are because you too are different like us. The only reason it does not happen to you is that you can hide your sexuality. So bear in mind these so called "straights" who are your role models to be, will not spare you on knowing your secret (and it is not because of us mind you) So why create this atmosphere of malice and hatred. why create this sunny-shia like divide( that has ripped the Islamic world apart) based on what is the appropriate behavior .</p>
<p>Appropriate behavior is the one in which both the side do not bothers or troubles the other Live your life and let other live. And have the BALLS TO support the week. Otherwise DO NOT CALL YOURSELF A MAN</p>
