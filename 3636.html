<p>LGBT Siblings!</p>
<p>I came out to my sister last november. I wasnt suprised when she supported me and told me it was ok as I knew already that she was supportive of gay rights and had a very liberal outlook. It felt nice to have a sibling as a support
Last night she kind of came out to me and told me she things she is probably a lesbian and she has never thought about boys in a sexual way. She always fantasizes about girls. And mind you she is 16.5 years old and i am 21.
After this i kind of feel weird! I thought coming out to my parents would be hard , but now what our parents think when they know both of their children turned out to be gay! (I am not against it , i just dont know how to deal with it). Having said that I completely support my sister in whatever orientation she has. </p>
<h1>GCI- That is amazing! :p</h1>
