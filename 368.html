<p>Hi everyone,, I am a student , my age is 23 yrs..
Due to the nature of my dad's job i had been to many places in india.. in the year 2003 we had to shift patna bihar. we all were scared as we were warned abt bihar that its a place of crime. we resided near exhibition road , i moved to a new school st.xaviers .. after migrating frm bengaluru i din imagined that patna wud b so cool.
i started a new tution for my weak chemistry, my tutor was a well known lecturer of a university though he tutored me alongwith his nephew,</p>
<p>his nephew was gud looking, i din noticed his beauty evr .. he was weak in english so he wantd me to figure this out. we started working,roaming together.. i dont kno whn i got attrackted to him ,soon we were talking hours on phone ..</p>
<p>seeing his face daily became my habit and compulsion, my day was incomplete ..finally on 1st of jan 2004 ,he kissed me.. that juicy kiss was more than 15 min long, he proposed me aftrthat we dated and unfortunatlly we had to move kolkata and that transfer broke everything.. and i lost him ..</p>
