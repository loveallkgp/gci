<p>A very close friend of mine likes me. He never said it but its clear he does. He is kinda cute n sweet to me. So I kinda like him too :) Its not that simple tho...here comes the twist!
There is this another very close friend of mine (a girl). She likes me. She is too shy to tell me but Everyone knows that she likes me big since years. She is really nice girl. Guys go head over heels for her. But since I don't ever go for her - people think m an ass. Only if they knew better Lol. So now the guy I talked bout initially likes this girl too. (yes the dude sure seems bisexual) But the thing is the girl won't love him back.
Now things have started to go awkward between. us. We r really close frens and things were cool back then but since mayb we growing up (m 19 BTW) things have started getting complicated. If I try to avoid the girl she goes mad on me. If I do talk the dude gets upset...visibly upset. I once told him to have all of that girls but he replied 'yea only if she'd get over u then only she can b of anyone's" :( I said "Fine. I will talk to her and I will step aside "
He replied "Why will you step aside? Don't bring any girl between our friendship"
n I was like "WTF. Its u who's doing it"
He laughed n said "Tu bahot bhola hai"
I said "Don't talk to me as if m some kid okay. Do this to ur girl"
He said nothing.
Whenever m talking to the girl nowadays he will try to separate us anyhow and starts talking to her. Even while taking a snap he will deliberately draw me away from her n he be with her. Recently I noticed it tho but he's been doing it since long.
I dunno if he wants "laddos' in both hands but m kinda stuck. Its not just him...its all three of us bound by our friendship that is making this even more difficult. Our one other very close friend of the group has even started noticing it. Why do I do? How to get rid off this? I don't want none of them but the fuckers won't lemme out. And the third asshole keeps spreading nonsenses rumors bout we three all the time. Such ass frens I've got -_-
P.S. m not ready to come out
not yet. not even to them</p>
<h1>GCI- Shit, how do you take so much drama? I applaud your patience. If I were you, I would have said them, "Listen up you bitches, I don't want either of you. So pack your emotional asses and bunk them somewhere. I want to just friends and it should come without drama. And to you(the guy), stop getting on my every last nerve. You want her? Get her! Don't drag me with you and then push me away. Let the universe remain in some fucking peace for once."</h1>
