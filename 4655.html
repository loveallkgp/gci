<p>Hay admin....Please post this....</p>
<p>I was in relation with the guy and we broke up..... but after that I started missing him so much.....we did talked over the phone and chat daily but now he is in relation with the other guy which hurts me the most...... I feel so happy for him that he found someone who will care more and love more than me...... but I have started feeling like my journey of life have come to an end.... I don't feel like doing any exciting things.... I don't like to go out and in order to cope with stress I have started smoking..... I know it's not good but I don't know why I am feeling all this... I always remember the way he use to say love you baby... just use to scold me ......
Please admin help me coz I guess m in depression.....
Because of this I got transferred to other department....so please help me out....as how to handle the situation wisely......</p>
<h1>GCI- Remember the reason that why you two broke up. Maybe something was not compatible between the two of you. Things break up in order to make space for new things. Leave him be now. You cannot keep on stalking him and his activities and make yourself miserable. It YOURSELF whom you should focus upon. And quit that smoking. It never helps. It will only take you down.</h1>
