<p>So here goes my story. A guy who is sceptical about everything in life. A complete lunatic who lives in a fantasy world. Now in his life comes a guy who thinks love is only found in nowhere plains.
This cute guy is as cosy as a teddy bear, and as passionate as all the cast of sex in the city put together.
He was the one who showed me the difference between a kiss of love and a kiss of lust.
Everytime i think about our first kiss, a piece of my heart aches.
It reminds me there is no way we can be together. Now who is responsible for this?
The society? they say its against our culture, they say the west is ruining our kids brains. wow, is it columbus who built kajeraho, is it plato who wrote kamasutra??
The government? they talk about swatchh bharat , when their brain itself is as filthy as a muncipal dustbin.They put up with an archiac law which tells US about what we can do with OUR own bodies!!!! bravo!!!
The media? no, it is more interested in zooming into an actresses cleavage. The law? no, they ruin what ever good people try to do with their preposterous PILs.
Every memory of his haunts my heart, breaks a peice of it. I wish karma was true and does the same to evryone who is responsible for it!!</p>
