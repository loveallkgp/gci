<p>Having a bf has been my "dream" since I came out to myself during high school.
I've been wishing to get a matured bf whom is 3-4 years elder than me since then. Having someone whom is a little elder to take care of would be really sweet. Staying together in a small condo would be great.. Waking up by the side of someone you care, sleeping with someone you loved. I would prepare your clothes and breakfast before work, you'd drop me to work before you head off to yours. Going out for dinner or some shopping after work. Sometimes, we could even prepares dinner together, after doing some groceries shopping. After dinner, we could sit down on the couch in front of the TV, lying on your chest, chit chat all night long... Get changed and went to bed. A soft kiss on the forehead. Hugging tightly on each other till we meet again in the dreamland.
Occasionally, we could go travelling together. Sharing the journey with your loved one is really amazing, sightseeing to different part of the world. Holding each other's hand in public in those open minded countries. During the weekends, we can go shopping.. Or visit out parents.. Bring them out for meals, telling them we are doing great...
This has been the dream man I've waited for at least a decade. The one I'm longing to meet in life since I found myself a homo...
*SLAP!!! Nah... It's just a dream...
