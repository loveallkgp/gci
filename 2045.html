<p>I want to confess..a very serious thing of my life... I started my career frm kolkata wit an organization travelled through out the country.. my last assignment was in bhopal..i was workind there till i got a call for lecturer in uttrakhand.. It was really hard to make my family understood though i always wanted to b a lecturer.. I din informed ma family and accepted that offer..i am here for more than a year while my family still thinks m in bhopal. I am living wid this guilt.. Finally i said it smwhr..kindly suggest as m bit afraid of saying it to my dad..</p>
<h1>GCI- You didn't do anything wrong. You just got a job at a different place. A job. I think your family can understand that. Or is there anything like that you were having some other job and then you got a job of a lecturer to which your family would be against?</h1>
