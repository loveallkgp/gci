<h1>GCI- There is no happiness or love when that is built on the ashes of some other person's stake. Dear u can clearly see that u r being the vamp here so y r u being so selfish as to not understand that HUMANITY exists but u r naming it as love.</h1>
<p>If the same would had been done by ur best friend or by a girl would u still had said the same or if any other guy whom u might hated or some family member or any random guy would had done the kind...would u still have had the same thoughts???</p>
<p>STOP saying its love its u and ur long term infatuation which is blind at present and yes CARING for someone DOESN'T mean that u love that person romantically....Grow up! This is life.
PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
