<p>At this juncture i find myself compelled to write these things.In vain have i tried to find a partner through this fake id,i've had talk with people from every class and i have come to conclude that no one is really interested in being friends with anyone here;they are either looking for a chat buddy or a fuck buddy or in worst cases,few are gold diggers as well.As bitter as it may be to write these things i feel all the same, thwarted and nauseated.It may be very hard to imagine two guys living together as couples in this homophobic society of ours yet i had hoped for a glimpse of light in this major sea of darkness.Often people who havent been able to get over someone arent able to accept any other person in their life,may be this is the case with me.Prudent it will appear if i were to get over this guy from my school days but it seems highly unlikely that i would ever be able to sleep without thinking of him.Straight, he is and trust me,lean muscle and masculine attitude is so much in him that his presence alone will gather admirance from any admirer of the male form;he is a born alpha male,who gets whatever he desires,by any means,his present girlfriend being one prime example of his ability to conquer;she is a diva.
                 I must say that i had an incident with him last year that has been haunting me for all these days.I slept with him.Yes,God knows i did.He did me as passionately as zeus would do a mortal woman,then grunted like a lion and went off to sleep assuming his classically sexy pose,on his back with one forearm as pillow thus emmiting the aroma of his masculinity in the whole room,this too naked, with his semi hard phallus still within my field of vision;needless to say sleep eluded me that night.In the morning he was again a brainwashed macho jerk,he had stopped being the greek god he was last night which left me wondering if that incident occured in real.
I donot have hopes to relive that one night for i know that it was all in a moment of heat and never in life,i have decided, shall i have physical intimacy with anyone for one simple reason which is -i dont want to dilute my memory of that night although it has gotten tarnished by my lack of self control in past few days;i slept with a couple of guys.From nowonwards i plan to conserve and direct my sexual energy into achieving something greater with that memory acting as a nidus around which my energy shall accumulate.I have been meditating and i hope to stimulate my chakras and awaken my kundalini.I also live like a hermit and scarcely talk to anyone.I feel like a 90 years old soul trapped in the body of a young man.I hope to be consumed by my desire for him...like mira for lord krishna,like sabri for lord rama.I feel eternally blissful in my longing for him and cherish each second for i know each second i am nearing to death which shall bring me closer to paramatma and in whom i shall be dissolved for eternity;my love for paramatma is now so great because i know the greatness of my love for one single soul of his,which fills me with joy while imagining the pleasure i shall get by reuniting with paramatma in whom are such souls in billions..it is like getting the whole heap of sand for one lost grain.Such is the power of meditation and celibacy...such seems the plan of providence.Bless me Lord and all the mortals..goodnight.</p>
<h1>GCIL- OK ! After a very long time I am impressed by someone's post and trust me I can totally understand u but dude only people like me can understand this monologue of yours. I am not sure others can actually decipher ur words put in such a strong manner or not.</h1>
<p>But here's a thing- Do not allow hidden hypocrisy and hermit cloak to cover u as a person. Trust me, I have been there done that and chances are there that u might become a poisonous obnoxious weed for others &amp; u must be dutiful to every side of ur soul, otherwise the nidus of ur accumulation of spiritual energy will face an ambush attack of ur layered unattended parts of your existence. Goodluck!</p>
