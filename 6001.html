<p>Some months ago, I got in touch with a young teenager online. Initially, we exchanged phone numbers and messaged each other occasionally. As time passed, we got comfortable enough to fix a date to meet each other. We both knew it was only meant to be a hook up and nothing more.</p>
<p>When the day arrived, I reached the place we had decided upon.
Now, prior to this, we had never seen each other in person. We had only exchanged pictures online. So when he finally arrived, I was surprised to see how young he was. He almost looked under aged. He must have lied about his age in order to meet me.</p>
<p>When we arrived at his place, his house was in total darkness. He had switched off all the lights in advance, almost as though he had been expecting me to come. At that point, I realized that he had been preparing himself for this moment. It made me smile.</p>
<p>In no time, we were in his room, kissing and grabbing each other. I undressed him and began to stroke his naked flesh with my warm hands. I could not help but admire his young, supple, soft, hairless body. He was breathing heavily, and I could sense his excitement. He then made me stand up and yanked down my shorts. He grabbed by erect member and began to eagerly suck me off. It felt great... boy was he good!</p>
<p>I didn't want to come too quickly. So I stopped him and made him lie on the bed. I then lifted his legs up in the air and I rimmed the hell out of his tight pink hole. He moaned with so much pleasure. It made me horny as hell.</p>
<p>After some more action between my tongue and his throbbing pink hole, he was ready to be fucked. I oiled him up and began to penetrate him slowly, inch by inch, while listening to his soft moans of pleasure mixed with pain. Once I was fully inside him, I began to thrust in a slow motion. We carried on like this for some time.</p>
<p>After a while, we tried a couple of different positions and found one that we both equally liked. It was then that I began to thrust harder and faster. As I was thrusting away, completely immersed in the pleasurable experience, he suddenly asked me to stop. I didn't understand what was happening. But then, I felt his hole clenching. And before I could say or do anything, he hurriedly got out of bed and ran to the toilet. As I looked down, confused and dazed by what happening, I was horrified to see my dick covered in poop. I was wearing a condom. But still, it was covered in human poop.</p>
<p>I just stood there. I didn't know what to do. One moment, we were both moaning with pleasure. The next moment, I was standing alone, my dick covered in human poop.</p>
<p>I don't remember the complete details of what happened from there on. But I somehow cleaned up myself and reached home without puking my insides out.</p>
<p>The only thing that I remember is taking a long bath before going to bed that night. I promise to God I washed my dick at least ten times that night.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was an unforgettable experience that I would like to actually forget. Sob! Sob! :'( :'( :-D :-D</p>
