<p>Hey 19 gay Mumbai! Well, umm.. I'm a regular reader of this page n knows that ppl who comment here on this page r well educated ,sophisticated n smart too! (Personally a big admirer of the admin n of ahir jay).. hehehe! Well I'm in a dilemma that can I become a straight male.?! Either I wanna become a straight person or to make India a better place for us! Everyone around me seems to b so conservative that I can't even think to come out n say that I'm a gay! For now I wanna complete my engineering n after that will look for a partner, I'm ready to endure anything if I get my desired partner! Seriously! N if we can stand in shoulder to shoulder with straight ppl n mark a mark in the field which we r interested in.! Sorry I just wrote what came in my mind as if I'm high I request u to forgive if I've said anything wrong! Hahahaha! </p>
<h1>GCI- Go for the second option. If changing your sexuality was so easy then,</h1>
<p>Why anyone would choose to be ridiculed and bullied?
Why anyone would be gay despite of living in a highly heterosexual environment?
Why anyone would fight for gay rights?
Why heterosexuals can't get converted to homosexuals?</p>
<p>Change is not possible. Its not a lifestyle one choose. Its not a phase. Its not you will loose overtime. You are here and you belong. Period.</p>
