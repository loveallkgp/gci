<p>Hey i have made this post in other forums as well i want to know others views on it,</p>
<p>Is Monogamous relationship really possible for this generation?</p>
<p>I read one article which said that Monogamous is fading among Millenials (also termed as Gen Y),those born between 1980 and 2000. They are the first generation with constant exposure to Internet, phones and social media.</p>
<p>Basically what article said was Millenials believe more in sexual freedom and there is disassociation of sex with reproduction to more towards "hooking up and friends with benefits".</p>
<p>The most troubling trend of Generation Y is that marriage is no longer viewed as a central organizing principle of society. It is becoming increasingly common for children to be born to couples who are not married. Also there is fear of commitment because of rise in divorce cases which is now more common and socially accepted phenomenon.</p>
<p>Another trend noticed is that in this age of technology and connectivity, people are emotionally disconnected and mistrusting of each other.</p>
<h1>Viv- To some extent that is indeed true. I mean we always end up on our phones either texting or checking out facebook but we forget the real deal of socializing. This is distancing us from the real world out there. Also, people do become paranoid about their partner's activities online. But still, people who want to be married and settled down, they do get settled down. There are always two sides of the same coin.</h1>
