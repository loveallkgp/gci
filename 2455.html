He used to keep very busy dan me n ab to clg bhi shuru ho gya to uske paas bilkul time nhi rehta since morning till he goes off to bed ! N dis is d only thing wich irritates me a lot n isi wajah s kaafi fights hoti hai ....
Pura din clg, classes, family, relativs se hi use fursat nhi milti ! Starting 2 mnths we used to hav late nyt chats evryday dat too till 5 am in da morning n still he used to say ki neend ni aa rhi ... Ab vo 11:30 hi so jata hai qki 5 bje to uthna hota hai use for his classes n all :/ ..... N i knw dis ki vo litrally busy rehta hai n na kisi social netwrkin me invold hai use tym hi kaha milta hai .... -_-
i just need to knw dat wat shud i do in dis situation ? I always shout on him dat u ignore bt he says dat its nothin lyk dat ... N HAMARE baare me to ab kuch baat hi ni ho pati hai... (lyk wen i say didnt u miss me evn once-n he try to turn around d topic) Mai try bhi karta hun to vo ignore karta hai !
Mai gusse me usse boht baar kuch na kuch kaha hai btt vo chup chap sun leta hai n baad me mai hi sorry bolta hun fir knwoing dat he was actually busyy ... Aaj hi baat hui to he said ki he'll try to talk wenevr possible on call n saturday/sundays ko hi mil paenge jo mujhe ni accha lag rha ...
Pehle har alternate day to bhi milte the n ab mujhse ye change kuch digest ni ho rha .....
Am still just going wid d flow !
Huh very complicated .... :( </p>
<h1>GCI- This is the very problem of us people that we don't have patience. We expect too much and when we don't get it, we feel angry. At the same time we can't notice what the other person must be going through. You, confessor are not able to completely understand his condition. You shout over him and then you say sorry. But it happens regularly. Maybe he is not ignoring you at all, he just don't get enough time. He is already burdened enough and then you put on your own drama on him. Keep on doing like that and he will literally go away from you because everyone has a limit. Despite of his busy schedule and you shouting on him he is still saying that he will try to take time to call on weekends. Tell me how is that not good? Also, if you shout on someone how can he reciprocate the love feelings? Damn! Try to step into his shoes once and realize his condition.</h1>
