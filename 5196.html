<p>Hello everyone,
Its not a confession. I just want to share something that happened in my college today.
Today there was a penal discussion on LGBT issues. I came to know about it by yesterday and was excited as hell for it. It was so good. There were 4 penalist. One was our beloved Prof. Two were open Gays and one was from Hijra community. They talked about all the issues related to the LGBT youths, starting from history to the current legal scenario. It felt so good to see such a huge audience and an overwhelming response from them. I know its sunday afternoon and nobody gives a shit, but still people came out of their rooms and participated in it. Some very good questions were raised.
One of the student from audience made a very remarkable statement. He said he is a jain and in Jain community their messenger of God Lord Mahavira was a brahmchari. And if someone is saying that being Homosexual is wrong because homosexuals don't reproduce then being Brahmchari is also not natural because you are refusing to reproduce.
Respect to you buddy.
It was a very sound discussion and people talked about sex and all the issues considered as taboo in our society.
But like every discussion, it was not all rainbows and unicorns. I was disappointed by the response of our faculty adviser on this issue. She didn't considered it as natural and claimed it as mental state and asked students not to indulge in any such activities. She said being in an IIT your main focus should be on studies. I was quite pissed off. But whatever we don't even listen to them while in the lecture let alone this subject. The motive was to spread awareness and get to know the stand of our administration on this issue and I guess it was a huge success.
Last I'll say kudos to NSS IIT ROORKEE team, a job well done.</p>
<h1>RainbowInRoorkee</h1>
<p>PS. They also conducted a survey on some of the issues of LGBT. It was very nice and heart whelming. Thank you.</p>
<h1>GCI- It's great that there are discussions happening. You cannot change the mindset of all. But you can be vocal about what you feel. Do not suppress your voice by thinking "Log kya kahenge". Be it LGBT, be it rape, be it child bullying, be it harassment etc.. just be vocal about all of this and make dialogues.</h1>
