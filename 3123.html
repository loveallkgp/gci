<h1>GCI yesterday, I was reading about serial killers. It happens tht top three of them were all child molesters. Sexually raped, tortured and killed hundereds of little kids. They themselves were also sexually exploited in their childhood. Nothing, no repentance justifies causing harm to a child, no matter what was done to you.</h1>
<p>I was wondering just One such big case in India and we can bury our LGBT Equality dead and cold for decades.
(#side 'fun' fact one of these monsters despite torturing and killing 300 kids has already been released and other one will be too bcs it happens that columbia doesnt have death punishent max 30 years. Avg.3 weeks per child. Makes melife long supporter of capital puishment)</p>
<h1>GCI- You know as they say that "an eye for an eye will just make the whole world blind", that shit is true as gold and people are making it true. I heard about the similar case in Pakistan in which one guy, who was molested in his childhood, used to connect to gay guys through gay dating apps, meet with them and then kill them. He killed around 3 guys including a retired army chief. When police captured him, he was interviewed and he was full hatred. He called gays as "kachra", or garbage. He killed innocents because of his hate, a phenomenon which is not unusual. We hear about it everyday.</h1>
