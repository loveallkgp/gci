<p>I am a normal guy but I think my roommate is gay. he talks like a girl mostly and doesn't drink or watch pondy. how to confirm? Every day I am scared to take of shirt in front of him. I also don't want aids.</p>
<h1>GCIL- First of all...calm down folks...He mustn't be bashed by anyone here( I myself wanna strangle him in my mind but I will choose peace this time).</h1>
<p>Now..here here love! Don't be afraid. Lemme make things clear and easy for u.</p>
<p>1- He is normal too, though of a different kind. He maybe autogynophiliac, gay or simply might be more 'feminine' as per ur descriptions. Nothing to worry about. ( I hope he doesn't see ur tar and soot of ur words of ur soul).</p>
<p>2- Teetotalers exist. Google the term. And watching porn or not is not a parameter of being straight. GET THAT STRAIGHT in ur pea-sized head.( I ignored ur typo here)</p>
<p>3- Take off anything from ur body whenever u want but please remove bigotry, narrow mindedness and ur ignorance too. That needs to be shed asap. U don't have a good body I can bet on that u insecure brat.</p>
<p>4- AIDS..hmmmmm...BIG word...ain't it mate?! 
But u know what..u will get AIDS only after u put ur willy in his ass( which I think must be good which makes it so irresistible i suppose) and spill ur liquid white beans in his back without protection. Rest u know how we contract HIV i think. Ryt!!</p>
<p>P.S- Next time try to read a book on human stupidity and humanity. U need them both urgently.
Happy life love!</p>
