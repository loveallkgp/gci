<p>I am the same confessor who wrote about marrying a woman who's now having sex with a friend of mine... Dear admin you wrote that I might be having an extra marital affair but I don't have the one... I am still virgin and extremely happy about it... Some people advised me to give divorce to my wife but unfortunately I have developed a certain inclination towards her.. Don't know how but I've started liking her..... Wish the same from her side... She still doesn't know about my sexuality.... Is sex only necessary for being in a relation????? </p>
<h1>GCI- NO sex is not the only part to be in a relationship...but lemme put this strt...</h1>
<p>IF U R MARRIED THAT ALSO MEANS TO BE SEXUALLY SATISFIED WITH UR PARTNER... and if you can carry on with this..then good luck with your choice...Hope you don't turn hollow and start man mongering or worst cheat her like Dr. Kamal Vedi and additionally keep ur 'soul' intact and not damage urself mentally(which u will as u shall realize one day)....bcoz GAYS MARRYING A STRT WOMEN IS EQUAL TO A STRT PERSON FORCED TO MARRY A  PERSON OF THE SAME SEX!!!! PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
