1. Your age?
2. From where you belong?
3. Are you open gay . . . I mean your school friends, college friends , family, relative are aware of this?
4.you people's are gay or bisexual??
5. What about your marriage plans . . . .you peoples will marry a girl or boy or no marriage.
6. Do you guys belong to any lgbt NGO or trust??
7. What you think indian supreme court or indian govt<em>bjp, have some positive thinking for lgbt . . .even they consider us??
8.your knowledge regarding </em>lgbt and Hinduism*
That's it . . .\</p>
<h1>GCI- I can only write about me.</h1>
<p>1) and 2) I am 23 and currently I am living in Montreal Originally I am from Amritsar.
3) I don't feel like coming out to anyone. One of my friend knows about me. I told her a year ago. But now it hardly matters. Lagi jaye jisko pata lagna hai. Jisko nai pasand aata, uski problem. Mera kuch nai jata.</p>
<p>4) Shat Pratishat Gay.</p>
<p>5) Hell no to the girl! Only a guy for me.</p>
<p>6) As of now, not at all but I plan to join one.</p>
<p>7) It's not BJP anymore. It is being controlled by RSS. Now I have had many arguments that RSS did good for India in the past but currently their actions are not very good. BJP or Modi can be good for country's economy but I do know it for a fact that they will be a cause of the breakdown of Indian society structure. I really don't have any views about Supreme Court. There were times in which SC gave really great decisions. There were times in which it totally sucked. </p>
<p>8) I can go on about it for hours but it's already 12:35am here and I have to get this report done. Just know that Hinduism never discriminated against any type of sexuality.</p>
