<p>Im not her to confess any thing rather share my feelings being gay :)</p>
<p>So both my parents died 2 years ago in a car accident. After which i had really become a bad person. I started taking bad stuffs and failing in college and so on. At the same time i meet a great guy. He asked me stop such things like harming myself with knife blades and stop taking bad things. I was very reluctant at first but later he showed me what love is, he loved me like his own child took care of me when i messed up. Finally he decided to propose me and i said yes. Now i can say im a changed person; he changed me, he took me in when my other family members have me up. He is 3 years elder to me and is an officer in at a MNC. My natal family is against homos but my parents knew about it and they were cool. So my question goes to all homophobes why the fuck do you mind if we two boys fall in love? And specifically to my soo called 'family' why did you give me up when my parents died? Why weren't you guys there when i needed you the most? 
It is truly said that when someone dies everyone is your court yard but today they will cry mourn and tomorrow they will forget. 
Anyways to all gay hating people i found my love and yes we have an intimate relationship and its you whose mentality should change but not mine. Period 
Plus i love to sleep in his strong arm it makes me feel protected :)</p>

<h1>GCI : hope these are not your delusions .  but anyhow good that you found somebody worthy .. a hero , a savior .</h1>
<p>but i would like to say to others who are going same kind of rough phase in life ..who are sad , who are self harming ..please .please ..please be strong . if you are waiting for someone to save your life take a look in the mirror . only person who can save you is you .... be your own hero. not everybody is lucky to have a partner so good.</p>
