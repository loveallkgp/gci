<p>I was molested by my cousin at age of 6 and it continued .At first I hated then I started liking it.</p>
<p>In short I become gay due to exposure to forced gay sex.</p>
<p>I think most of us share the same story. I want to hear yours. </p>
<h1>GCI :  i have different view  though i used to think the same thought but i changed it .</h1>
<p>i think some people get to know about their sexuality at a very tender age as it was with  me ... i knew it already when i was maybe 6 or 7 . having crush on guy living in adjacent house . then as i grew having crushes on male actors . </p>
<p>but some people are not sexually active at small age and when they hit puberty they figure out their sexuality at puberty age ..but others are even more late ... who find their sexuality at age 20 , 25 or sometimes at 30 . 
so you can't say that something happened in childhood will make you that... it just brings out what you are gonna be . and think again ' is you cousin gay now as he was kid too when he did that to you '' ... ??? a straight person would later in life distant themselves from gay sex after a certain age .  and so many straight guys themselves were once involved in gay sex with cousins or friends as part of fun or exploration ..</p>
