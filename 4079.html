<p>Hi,
I've been dating a guy and we are going out for 9 months now. I'm really scared of anal and I never had one. I'm a virgin and my boyfriend also doesn't force me. Although we tried once but I was too scared. Now my friends say that sex in eternal for love. They say that he would cheat and blah blah. And I'm second guessing myself. Everything was alright until they opened their big mouth. Now I started behave a little cautious. I love him and I don't want to destroy it. Is it necessary that to sustain a relationship we need to have sex? And if yes I would try my level best. Please give me tips to prepare.
Thanks :)
Cheerio</p>

<h1>GCI- Sex is required to make the bond between partners more strong. If he doesn't force you then its his maturity, but it is also a body need. Just prepare yourself for it mentally and before that do make sure that you both want it.</h1>
