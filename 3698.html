<p>Helo pals I am a regular reader of this page but hv nvr posted anythng yet. Today for d frst tym Iam sharing my exprinc.</p>
<p>Iam 21yrs guy frm new delhi. I created my fake id in march of this year and there i got a guy and later we went into relation. Actually, this was his 2nd gay relation but mine was 1st. His 1st BF  stays alone in agra.
I was nt much aware n not evn bothered of the game-plans which evey gay profile do (i'm talking abt politics in gay world).
My bf use to work in some telecomm compny in nehru place n he said that he'll b visiting Agra for nxt 6months for sm training purpose. 
But one week back i came to knw abt d fact dat he was fooling me as he went agra for d life time n will stay there along with his ex in his flat. I dnt knw hw smone can play wid human feelings n emotions.
More shocking to me was when i got an email on 26septmbr on my mail id with the message 'Ur fan frm agra........tujh jesa chutiya nahi dekha' frm an unknwn email id :( :(</p>
<h1>GCI- That is bad. Anyways, what I don't understand is how can people have time to do so much pathetic drama?</h1>
