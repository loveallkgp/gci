<p>i m a 21 y/o. gender fluid trans. today i m going to confess something about my life. at the age of 6 i first realise that my body is wrong i feel suffocated in a male body. but that time i dont knw the terms acctually. 1day i told to a frnd that i feel like a woman i want to sit on the girls' bench in the school. the frnd do not ubderstand me,my feelings he was so harsh n made fun of me infront of other boys n grls. at 8th i was bullyed very much by boys in my class n others too, that bhagwan ne galti kardi ye vo etc.. i just ignored n concentrated on studies. i was a average student. at the age of 19 i question my self that m i a girl or what .. like before i hate my body so much but wen i stepped in puberty that hate some kind of gone away from me. i feel some times like a man some times woman .when i feel like a woman i like to do crossdressing for relaxation and feel myself as a grl . i went frm a psychiatrist but he told me m not transsexual grl n he wont giv me a gid certificate..but still i dnt understand my gender identity as its fluctuates.</p>
<h1>GCI- You got it right that you are gender fluid. Sometimes you feel like a man and sometimes you feel like a woman. And that's not a disorder. Some people may not agree with it but there is a scientific proof of that. Visit this link for more information.</h1>

<p>And honey, if you want to visit a psychiatrist, go to a LGBTQ+ friendly one.</p>
