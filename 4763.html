<p>Hello to all if you and first of all, let me wish you a merry Xmas.
I'm reading this page and those posts since quite a while now, even tho I'm not Indian myself.
I am french.
But my boyfriend is Indian.
We are together since 2 years soon, but currently separated by thousands of kilometers due to my being with family for end of year's celebration.
It is not always easy to date someone from another country and culture, specially when india is so "narrow minded" and closed on the topic of gay.
In my country we can recently marry with same gender.
It's been a long fight.
I wish you same soon.</p>
<p>My boyfriend is waiting for me now. Preparing the flat where we gonna spend together the next year, when I arrive.
Even tho not Indian myself, I know very well of your culture, where I chose to live since the last decade.
I hope all will be fine with my boyfriend, as its first time in all that time I'm dating an Indian guy.</p>
<p>Received today that message (in another app) and wanted to share it with you guys, to let you keep positive and to say that it is possible, even in a closed culture where homosexuality is still taboo, that you may find love.
Not necessarily with a foreigner of course.</p>
<p>All the best to you guys, and enjoy end of 2014 to start happily and smiling 2015</p>
<p>PS : that makes me happy (for you guys) that such pages exist out there on the net and on Facebook.
Do not only read but try to share your experience.
The worst is silence... When you think you are all alone back there, facing what you have to face.
You are not.
Let it know to others as they let it know to you.
Good luck to all.</p>
<h1>GCI- Belated Merry Christmas to you and your boy too! :) Have a good year ahead.</h1>
