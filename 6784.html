<p>I'm Confessor #6770, and I've written a poem through the eyes of a Transwoman (which I am). It's imaginary, so if there's any resemblance that you see, it's a coincidence (and the condition in India).</p>
<p>I was walking into the woods the other day
I could feel the trees moving to show me the way
The birds were chirping and I could feel the cold air in my ears
Suddenly, my eyes got wet and my cheeks were filled with tears</p>
<p>They took him away from me forever
Saying that he'll just break my heart
They didn't realize that what they were doing
Was actually tearing me apart</p>
<p>My heart and soul are of a girl
Sadly, my body is of a boy
"Indian Society" makes fun of me
Like I am some kind of toy</p>
<p>I've lied because I feared them
I would rather die a true death than live a fake lie
I believe the time has come to tell everyone
I don't want to be a husband, I want to be a wife</p>
<p>I don't want to be a boy, I want to be a girl
It doesn't even matter if it twists my world
If I have to cry, I will cry
If it gets me killed, I'm ready to die</p>
<p>I may be manly physically, but at heart I'm a female
People don't go deep in my heart and think I'm a male
I won't give this up easily without a fight
Being the Gender "I" want to be is "MY" birthright</p>
<p>My heart has given up on my body too soon
But my soul doesn't intend to give up on my heart
I have always loved the feminine side of my sexuality
And it hurts to be of the male gender in reality</p>
<p>I have talked to lot of people including my parents but they won't understand
The way it's going I'm not sure if it will be a happy end</p>
<p>Whoever I am I want my parents to accept me that way
Only then, after this ageing darkness, will be a beautiful day
If I don't get accepted by my own, my life will be darker than the darkest night
I don't want to do anything which will make me disappear forever from everyone's sight</p>
<p>I could've used a rope to hang myself by kicking the chair or the stool
Or live my life like a boy repenting that I am the biggest fool
I know it would be hard but whatever I am deep inside I want my parents to accept me that way
If that happens only then, after this killer darkness, will be a shiny and beautiful day.</p>
