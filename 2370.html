<p>Hi....I am 20 years old.I was sexually abused as a kid.even tgh I have strong liking for guys, I sometimes have this wierd feeling that may be my abuse didnt let my sexuality bloom properly n probably since I was introduced to gay sex much before I could explore straight sex, dats d reason why I Like men.sometimes I even wonder dat if I wasnt abused, I would have been living a different life Today. This turmoil of emotions erupt out may times.I feel extremely helpless.....I don't know how far my tghts are valid but cnt help it.....</p>
<h1>GCI- I'm so sorry to hear about the issue.. But the thing that you mentioned is debatable. There will be people who will say you are not made gay and then there will be people who will say that they were made. Like your case. Its all very much confusing to think about everytime. At the end of the day, you are gay. Doesn't matter whether you were made or born. And it is completely okay. From the next time try to keep the child abuse part and being gay part away from each other. You will have a less of turmoil.</h1>
