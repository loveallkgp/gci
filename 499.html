<h1>Viv- Start with the basic rule of knowing him more without making any advanced which can creep him out. When you get comfortable enough with him, then start talking about LGBT stuff and see how he reacts. If he is indifferent about the topic like, "Okay these people should have their rights" he is straight. But if he is too much compassionate about the issue says it fiercely then there is a chance that he might be gay. If positive, then you can profess your love.</h1>
