<h1>Viv- I am so sorry for you! That is pure evil whatever happened with you. I really can't figure out why he did that but human nature is just too much unpredictable. You cannot believe anyone so easily. 2 days are just too less to believe someone. The views of your bf are just too much contradictory. You can think many things but in the end it all comes down to the fact that he is trying to move away from you. Moving on from someone you love is never easy. You have to give your every bit of strength for it. It take months. Personal experience. But once you are over it, it feels good.</h1>
