<p>I am flabbergasted, last night i was chatting with a guy on PR, i dont know when i fell asleep that too without locking my cell or logging out from PR. Now when i log in today i see the last reply, it looks totally not from me. The language used is surely not me. I have a feeling that my roommate replied. But he has idea about my sexuality and he was normal in the morning. Although we went to our offices, and we didnt come home as he went to party. Should i confront him when he comes back? </p>
<h1>GCI- Doesn't your phone has an automatic security key? If he knows about you then you can ask him. If he doesn't then I don't think that you should say anything. If his behavior is normal then let it be. The other case can be that you could have texted like that and you might have forgotten about it. It is a possibility.</h1>
