<p>Hello admin.......its all of a sudden i realised that things have been quite weird ......i am a person believes in both love as well as sex....i dnt find sex as sinful or stuff like that...anyways the prblm is that i used to be this person who always wnted love ...searched for guys ...who wuld love me like anything...unfortunatly after so many terrible relationships i hve had ..i ws never ever able to trust anyone..i am never able to feel anything for anyone ..nd i still wnt love so bad...i wnt smone in my life........my friends do encourge me to go for it.....i do date bt nt so much nd i really feel lazy to date anymore!!! Apart from that i hve even lost intrest in gng on for sex dates as well...i am nt a frequently for sex bt yess we all need sex at a point...i do watch porn ..do my thing nd ofcure satisfied ...bt whn i am with smeone i just stp half the way becuse i dnt feel like havin it....!!!i wnt sex time bt whn i go for a sex date i dnt hve it or i just walk towards my home straight back thinking" wt am i doin ...just becuse i am single doesnt mean i can do watevr i wnt"!!!! I seriously am so confused ...i am always confused ...nd i dnt knw wt to do!!!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Stop being double minded for once, and stop all of your activities for a brief period of time. Think why you feel guilty about having casual sex? It's just sex and sex is a recreational activity that has been embedded in our brain. All the perceptions that sex is bad and you should not have it, has been fed to us by religion, other beliefs and bollywood. If you have sex then that's okay. Let go of the guilt.</h1>
<p>Now to the second issue. Don't chase love. The more you chase it, more depressed you will get. You will be at a stage that if you meet anyone, you will see a potential partner in them and you will be like one of those desperate guys who say "I love you" after a day of texting. That doesn't go well. If you want to think, then think about how you will be dealing with your insecurities and not how to get trapped in your insecurities.</p>
<p>So take a break for a while and spend some time with yourself.</p>
