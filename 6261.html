<p>Hi i am a pure top. I get attracted to handsome men but i m not really homo. My problem is I like a guy and we meet often for sex but he acts like girl sometimes. He want to hug and kiss and do dating. Its dirty for 2 men to do that. I told him we should act like men but he does lot of drama. How to make him understand?</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmm...Dude ur confession is fucked up at so many points that answering u in this single post won't be enough. But still-</h1>
<p>1- U are afraid of ur own acceptance as LGBT!
2- U think U can play safe by tagging urself as 'TOP'..I mean literally dude!? Explain what is 'TOP' to enlighten us please????
3- U think its dirty because U have a narrow space in ur grey matter which is on the verge of extinction.
4- U lack the white matter as well ur cortex is also fucked up, so its better u try to understand urself first and then try to make others understand.</p>
<p>P.S- I agree that U may be androphiliac but ur words are advocating misogyny, discrimination against feminine gays and a shame associated with being LGBT! 
Work on urself and ur thoughts first then take the baton to preach others.PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
