<p>In relationship with this guy since over two years. I never trusted him, he was too flirty and friendly with everyone and hangs out a lot with other people. I was too scared to risk my emotions. But nevertheless he has always been an wonderful bf. I always convinced myself into believing that he is cheating on me. Then one day I somehow found out the pass key to his phone. At night when he was sleeping, I secretly took his phone and started checking all his Facebook and whatsapp chats. As usual I was expecting his messages to be filled with sex chats and all those flirty things. But to my surprise I didn't find a single chat where he was flirting or sex chatting or anything that's out of line. And there is no way he might have deleted anything because he knows very well that I never ever check his phone nor he checks mine. That night I felt really sorry, I judged him too fast. In the last two years of our relationship I have never loved him truly enough and I regret. After that night I promised myself to be more open to him and pour my heart into our relationship. And I admit it all tops are not sex seekers!</p>
<h1>GCI- How dare you!!! Never repeat the same right thing infront of him!!!</h1>
<p>But one thing IF THERE IS NO TRUST THERE IS NO US..BUT IF THERE IS BLIND TRUST THEN THERE IS ONLY U!</p>
