<p>Dear friends,
 Love you all Romeos.....
 Am again here for few stuffs which I would like to share with everyone. Nothing personal my dear friends. Opinions and views are highly appreciated.
 Few confessors here refered heterosexuals as "normal", like normal sex, normal relation, normal partner, etc. etc. Why is this friends? Don't you understand that this automatically refers us as "abnormal"? Guys, pls take it seriously that we all are normal, ALL NORMAL, except people who over act or over react and make fun/fool of themselves/us. Clinically or medically speaking......guys pls consider this seriously and keep deep in your head.....there is no physiological difference between a GAY and a STRAIGHT. If you think that you have 'mans boobs' (gynecomastia) or not big genitals (which may not be actually small, but you think so) which makes you gay, YOU ARE WRONG. Trust me guys, these physiological features does not decide whether you are Gay or Straight. Lot of Straights also do have similar features, BELIEVE ME. Earlier, 'homosexuality' was considered as a mental disorder. Later, not homosexuality but depression which may be caused due to homosexuality was considered as mental disorder. Recently, 'both' are not considered as mental disorder. So, all my sweet hearts, you are PERFECT and NORMAL. Sigmund Freud, renowned psychoanalyst, said that all humans are born bisexual (innate bisexualty) and through psychological development (both internal and external factors) most become monosexual while bisexuality remains in a latent state. He said heterosexuality and homosexuality have both developed from this original bisexual disposition. He called called homosexuality an "inversion", which in his view was distinct from the necessarily pathological perversions. All my sweet hearts, I guess, to a significant extent, I am able to convince that we all are NORMAL and PERFECT.
 Regarding "Coming out".....dear Romeos, why do you think that it is necessary to come out if it is unsafe somewhere? Why do you think that "coming out" is a way of accepting yourself or getting confidence? I feel that, confidence comes (should come) from within, if we depend on something external for happiness or confidience, we become dependent on that external source. This makes our happiness or confidence 'volatile'. We should be independent. Why we have to wait for others to accept us so that we can accept ourselves? Again, acceptance comes from within. Lets be independent, it makes us feel so good. Heterosexuals sometimes have extramarital relation, do they dance around for coming out that they have somebody else in their life other than their life partner (am not saying that extramarital affair is correct)? Everyone has secrets in life (infact, should have) and that should only be disclosed in a safe situation and place (society). Having secrets in life is not a sign of cowardness, and keeping mouth shut (not telling truth) doesnot mean that one is falsifying. Does a straight wake up on one fine morning and say 'mom, I am straight'. He doesnot do so because he knows that he is normal. Then why us? Is it because we are not with social acceptance? Anything that is not acceptable at one society doesnot necessarily make it a crime when acceptable at a different society. What Gandhiji did was against British laws. For British, it was crime. Gandhiji never shouted out alone infront of British administration that we need freedom. Rather he made a movement which includes lot of peoples and each and every one of them had the same interest, "Freedom". That was "Mass" a "Strength". So, correct time and correct place is important. Just coming out somewhere where you are unsafe or where you are unable to count the consequences, is simply an act of stupidity and not bravery (I feel). All social problems related to LGBT(except very few serious issues, no doubt they are really pity) are in our heads. Lets make us understand that we have to make ourselves free from our own self-made barriers. Yes, off course, there are unavoidable issues in our society, but not to that extent as we make a big issue of it. I am just talking of those barriers which are just in our thought process. And guys who are so desperate of coming out, you can always travel to your place of choice. Your wish should make your own choice. Humans can do anything dear. There is always a solution for everything, just we need to make our priorities, and priority can always be one at a time. India is very liberal.......just look at the Muslim countries.....so difficult for LGBT brothers there. I think friends, "coming out" should not be an issue for us.
Finally, lets clean our own door steps and the world will be clean. Lets "make" the "society" and then lets see who is against us in the SOCIETY. Lets stop blaming gradually and lets start taking responsibilities for ourselves first and then our community. Lets develop the power to influence. I am sorry if I am not able to portray my views clearly.
Am 31, still waiting for my better-half to appear. Sometimes I feel that you all are my betterhalves and I dont need a special one.
Love you all MY SWEETHEARTS. I live not only for myself but for my sweethearts too.</p>
