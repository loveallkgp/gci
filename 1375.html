<p>basically,my dad works in indian air force.. so due to his postings to various places.. we get posted to new n different places within every 3-4yrs..
it all started when i was in 8th class.. due to sexual excitations.. me n my frnd started doing gay sex with each other .. it went on.. but sometime i really didnt njoy n he used to simply use me.
..
then we got transfered to punjab.. where i met my first true love.. he was smaller dan me two years.. so i used to consider him as my bro .. but slowly .. i really dont know how .. he started taking up my caring attitude towards him as somthing different... n den gradually i started loving him.. his simplicity .. truthfulness.. etc..
thr i also met raj(not real name) an another frnd who was of my same age.. nd at dat time we were jus accomplices..</p>
<p>den came d time to again leave.. n dis time i had to go to kolkata.. leaving my frst love.. n my best frnd raj... fr d frst time i felt sooo lonely.. coming here in kol..due to d absence of my frst love lot of times i tried to do suicide.. but my best frnd raj who is also gay.. always helped me to console n made me understand dt its futile..</p>
<p>aftr few years my frst love came to kol..we met also.. went fr dinner in a restaurant... though i had nvr had guts to propose him or say abt my feelings neither him.. we somehw loved each other.. i feared dat if i propose him.. i may even lose my current frndshp with him.. aftrsome time i had even told dat i love u .. in a joking manner.. so dat i can express myself also..n he dosent gts hurt too.. aftr few months.. jus dnt know why.. thr ws no more contact between us.. bt i still remembred d last time he said me dat his mom is not dat much modern.. n his eyes were a bit liquidy..
soo my relationdhp ended.. bec dis grt society of india dosent accepts gay relationps..</p>
<p>den bec. of my good looks .. many girls tried to lure me.. n proposed me... but at d end.. i didnt able to jus say dem no widout any xplanation.. again fr d same reason of our unacceptance by indian society.</p>
<p>den at last but not least.. my best frnd raj.. with whom i used to share each n everything of my life.. yestrday said me dat "bye forever".. our gay frndshp can't go forever.. we had to move on.. n accept d reality.</p>
<p>jus dnt know wot to do..</p>
<p>life jus sucks.. kaun sa paap kiya tha..gay bankar .. god nly noes..</p>
<p>because of all these.. lost my best frnd,my lover,ppl abused me and cudnt give others proper xplanation or reason fr refusal.</p>
<h1>Viv- Those people who pay too much emphasis on "Oh! What people surrounding us are gonna say?", can never take a stand for themselves. So, before making things cozy with someone ask him if he is comfortable in living the way he is and can never be subdued by the pressure of the society and family. Gay bankar koi galti nahi ki. Galti bass ye thi ki tumhare known logo ko apne liye stand lena nahi aaya.</h1>
