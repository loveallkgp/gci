<p>This is not really a "gay" confession (but I'm gay), so I don't know if you'll post this -but would be ever grateful if you do...</p>
<p>I'm 22 from Kerala staying with my mom and her parents. My dad passed away when I was a few months old. I don't have any real memories of him- just a few photos and my parents's wedding DVD which I forced my grandfather to convert from the VHS tape. There are no photos or pictures of my dad hanging in my home. I asked my grandparents about this years ago, they said it reminded my mom of my dad, so they don't put up pictures. They told me- he died of a heart attack when he was posted to North India. When I asked to see his grave, they said he'd been buried there itself. I was also told that his relatives kept away from our family after his death. My grandparents and mom ensure that I'm given the best of everything- clothes, books, toys, electronic devices. I used to call my Grandfather as "Daddy" too. I never felt like I had missed out on anything in life.</p>
<p>Then one day when I was about 16-17 years old, I don't remember exactly what happened but I was angry with my mom and said something like "No wonder my father died, he couldn't manage with you like this". She burst out crying and went to her room. My grandfather slapped me and I cried myself to sleep that night. The next morning, everything seemed to be normal- my mom was talking as if nothing happened. After a few days, they told me something that shocked me- my father wasn't dead, they got a divorce. It was an arranged marriage. Apparently my father's family was not as well off as ours and this created a lot of problems right from the beginning.( I don't want to get into details here but he pawned his wedding ring it seems.) They told me I was too small to understand, so they told me he died. I was shocked for a few days but eventually got back to normal. Since I'd already told my friends about my father's death, I still continue the same story. Life went on as usual until last week.</p>
<p>Last week, I got a friend request to my original id- from my father!!! I went in and checked the photos and confirmed it was him. He'd aged quite a bit (I was seeing him after more than 20 years) but it was him. I kept quiet about it and left the request as it is. Then I got a message- "Hi" last night. I finally told my mom about it. She told me- "You are an adult now, do what you think is best. Bear in mind that he hasn't spent a single paisa on your education or anything else. I don't want to have anything to do with him. If you want to leave me and my old parents and go with him, I won't stop you. I heard that he got married after that, so if you go, you'll be like a step son, he'll make you do house work....." From her tone I knew she didn't want me to contact him. Later I caught her in tears, but she said it's nothing.
Now I'm confused, I believe every story has 2 sides- should I accept the request and see what he has to say or block him forever and continue with my life. If I do this, he won't be able to contact me through fb but what if he suddenly lands up at home or my office one day. 
What should I do? I'm really confused and would appreciate all the help I can get.</p>
