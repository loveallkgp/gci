<p>Hello,
I am 30 years old guy, hail from a small village in Punjab. I have been in Canada for the last 7-8 years. My parents are still in India. The thing is that even though I am here from so many years but still people around here won't consider me as one of them. I am always the outsider. They talk, hang around but never let in. I guess it is just 'coz I am an Indian. I am out. Most of my friends, esp. Indians, started avoiding me since then. I am frustrated. To the whites I am an outsider, and to the Indians I am abnormal. So both groups don't want to be with me. I dunno what to do? Do any of you guys feel the same or am I the only one?
Love :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Its not just the case with you. People are shallow. They talk all they want, they have fun whenever they want but they are insecure and scared to let someone cross the emotional boundaries. All of it is because they don't want people to know about their weaknesses. In a matter of 3 months in Canada, I have observed it. I am compassionate when it comes to friendship, but rarely someone here have the correct level of emotions.</h1>
