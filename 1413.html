<p>Hi I am not gay but a transgender woman.I don't want to confess but I want to talk about something. My topic is "TRANSPHOBIA IN LGB COMMUNITY ".I saw your status where you mentioned HIZRA as a word of insult ..It's really hurting for me My own LGBT community is denying transgender..One of your gay members of this page  joined my group ..and said that transgender don't get acceptance in gay community because of over make up..This kind of ignorant I did not accept from my LGBT family .I requested so many gay guys to support our movement but very few joined ..We are all part of big LGBT FAMILY ..We Should respect each other </p>
<p>$ABBY : first of all i thank you that you put your point forward . 
see a trans is not insult , nor is 'hijra' .  society ( straight people ) has been very unacceptable towards hijras . they were and still are taken as funny looking people. the thing is people in india hasn't yet accepted gays and lesbians ... and accepting trans people is way more hard for them . 
again coming to your point that why gay men hate it being called hijra or trans is coz they are not hijras . secondly in society people always used term ' hijra' as abuse or to degrade a man or to insult that's why its offensive . be it in north , or south india hijras are made fun of . they called them ' beech wale' that's gay men find it offensive. </p>
<p>but time has changes as trans people are now declared third gender in india and that now they can get jobs too .. this thing will change the scenerio in india . people took hijras ' only as dancers or as people who just collect money on traffic signals ' . but as now more  and more people will come in contact with hijras things will change . i hope you understanding my point i wanted  say so many things but i can't . but soon we will disscuss about it on our page .</p>
