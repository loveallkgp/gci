<p>Hello..
Been reading so many confessions here and just wanted to share a thing that's been bothering me since forever.
Coming to the issue, not that I'm too effeminate, but I'm little bit graceful. Sometimes, the flames come out strong and many times, I perfectly fit into my pretending-to-be-straight world. Till school days, I somehow managed to escape from the tantrums and the bullies, I eventually started suffering during my college days. Some ppl started making fun of me at times, and I took in a good humor, as I din wanna stretch it into a bigger issue.
But the real problems began, when I started working. Though, I was being very friendly and polite with everyone, I repeat, EVERYONE, some ppl hated me for some of my graceful gestures. They made fun of me on my back and sometimes, in front of me, I just gave them a fake laugh and ignored them. I thought they'd stop it eventually, but it was just getting worse. Majority of my colleagues were nice to me, but the minor no. of ppl troubled me a lot and started making fun of me directly. Once I lost my cool, and I shouted and threw a glass of water on a colleague's face, as he was imitating me like giving a BJ to someone. The issue reached my TL and she was being a sweetheart when I told her what he did and didn't take any action against me. She convinced me that if I had complained to her, instead throwing water at him, she cud've took action against him. But still, some other ppl's actions were bothering me. So, I decided to quit my job to pursue my dream career. I worked doubly hard and made myself a well-qualified candidate for my dream job.
Recently, I attended the interview for that job and I really performed very well. They told me that they'd call me abt my selection. But I kinda had already overheard their decision. Someone made a comment that I'm not manly enough for that job. While someone called it "being graceful", the other one called it "chhakka". I just wanted to jump off that building at that moment. But I just swallowed my gut and met them in their room, said "Thank you" and left the place, asap.
I never felt that something is "abnormal"(?!) abt me and I've always tried to mingle with everyone. Yet, at last, God made me hear those words.
Now am so scared to even attend another interview as I really don't wanna hear such remarks abt me. All of a sudden, I feel my confidence level being shattered into pieces and that all my hard work I'd put in has no meaning.</p>
<h1>GCI- For one, you should never have quit the first job. Go over there and ask for the job again. I am sure the people will understand you. You are not the only one who gets bullied. One thing that you are missing is the guts to stand different. You get bullied because you feel bad about yourself. If you are happy with your behavior, then I don't think that anyone can bully you. You graceful ways are a part of your nature. I don't think you can change it. You are coming out as a looser from the situation. Get your head on the right track please.</h1>
