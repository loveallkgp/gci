<p>hi guys,
i am a delhite, 21years of age.
i started using this account, when i was of 19.
i was not aware of this world. all i know was, i need a satisfaction of urges that are arousing out of me. i used to fantasize hunks romancing girls.
so, wanted to meet guys and romance them. i am strictly not into anals, it disgusts me, i feel satisfied and aroused with soft romance, which includes kissing and cuddling.
i met certain guys, had some intimate moments, but the kind of romance, i was expecting, did not got.
The reason i analyzed was that, there were no feelings involved in it, it was just a thirst quenching act.
Then i thought, i should be in a relationship, so that i can spend some romantic moments, with true feelings.
i started hunting guys, for relationship, and what did i got....betray, stress, doubts, no space.
how can i give a guy 24*7 time, i have my own family, studies, therefore, there was a unbalance between these two world.</p>
<p>now, i am alone in this world, i am not depressed, by this fact, instead, i have a hope, which never let me down, someday i will meet Mr. Perfect Stranger in my life, who may give me what i really deserve.
I am now not in any kinda hunt or race, i have started believing in destiny.</p>
<h1>Viv- Well, when you get in a relation you should learn how to maintain balance in everything in your life along with some personal space. Keep your head up and do what your mind desires.</h1>
