<p>I'm seriously in love wid one of my best friends, I could not keep it to myself and I made a confession that I love him so much and that I will take care of him for my entire life if he likes it. he said that he respects whatever love I have for him but still he doesn't want to c my face again in his life. Everything ws just fine till that day, but nw I m totally broken, no matter whatever I keep telling myself , I still think of committing suicide but scared fr dat too, I thought everything abt my parents and the ones who love me but still I don't want to live. This pain is too much to take, at the end of everyday I think of ways to kill myself..</p>
<h1>GCI- DO NOT EVER THINK ABOUT SUICIDE! You hear me? Its bad enough that you are sad and got heartbroken but say no to suicide. You have other potentials. You have much more than having this unrequited love. You have a bazillion things to do in life which will fill you with great spirit. Never think of suicide. Ever!</h1>
