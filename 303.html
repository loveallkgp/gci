<p>I am seriously in love with my friend cum colleague. he is a twink. very cute. as i am a gay, it s natural to get attracted towards him, we both are of same age. I fantasize him a lot while masturbating and would like to play both roles ( top n bottom) with him. though we are friends, i am not sure about his orientation. he lives in a flat with his friends as he is not from bangalore. he is daily killing me by his looks, smile, behavior. i want to get close to him and know him to the core. As I feel he is straight, i don't have guts to reveal my desires and interest in him even  indirectly. also we not close to each other now. i need him in my life and i want to be in his life, not neccessarily as partners or in relationship, but at least as close friends. need suggestions. thanks in advance. </p>
<h1>Viv- Its not really difficult to befriends with someone. If your thoughts match then you can become his friend very easily.</h1>
