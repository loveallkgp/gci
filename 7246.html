<p>Hello everyone!
I m 23 years old and final semester of Computer science engineering. I just cannot explain the state of mind I m in these days. The problem is that I am homosexual and I am not able to explain this fact to my parents. Once I tried to tell this thing to my mom to which she said," Beta, don't be upset. Things will come back to normal once you will get married. It happens sometimes at this age." You know the same thinking of Indian families. I met a guy over Facebook around 6 months ago. We used to meet and became greats frndz in course of time. Around a fortnight back, he proposed me and now I m living the best days of my life. Now, I m unable to understand how to make my parents understand my feelings and this part of life. I can't live my life happily being separated with them and leaving them disheartened. I always wanted to live a life full of love nd care and now my Angel is here. But I don't know how to handle my parents. They always talk about my marriage as m the eldest child of the family and they want me to get married lil early. 
Please help me.. how to tell my parents that I have already found my soul mate and want to spend my life with him. Dying everyday with these thoughts. Please help!! </p>
<h1>GCI- Just elope away and do not try to explain anything to anybody.....This sounds simple..ryt?</h1>
