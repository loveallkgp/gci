<h1>GCI- He would do the same if you got back together. It's better you stay like this only and do not contact him. No need to listen for those 15 minutes. He clearly does not feel for you the way you feel for him. If he tries to get away from the topic, just say "Come to the point." There is not need to cry for him.Alright?</h1>
