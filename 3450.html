<p>A long But true story..
I am an 18 year old Guy from jaipur..pursuing my b.tech .. I joined here 2 years ago..that time i was intentionless.. I was jus a queer.. a lost 16 year old guy. knowing nothing bout this gay world.. what I knew was jus about the Gay sex.. I never knew if gay relationships existed..
But in june 2012 everything changed.. I came across so many ppl..
Like them.. i too thought of man of my dreams.. then..!! .. startled by looks..mm.. actually i am really into looks thing.. very much and sometimes I hate it..
I chatted to many people.. made friends. I was easily convinced that time by the false stories ppl told.. for sympathy..
In school tat time in my class there was a guy named sagar.. who was a big crush of mine!(biggest though).. n everytime i saw anyone by this name..i jus remmbrd him.. then one day I got connected to this guy by a mutual friend.. actually I liked the way of his replies over comments.. N coincidentally His name was Sagar..
I immediately sent him request.. He accepted.. (to my surprise!) tat very moment.. n then we started chatting.. We chatted a lot.. the whole night..talking on everything.. till morning.. we assumed ourselves falling for each other.. He proposed me at the dusk..to which i easily accepted..
It was a good time going in my life.. it was like butterflies all around...music playinf everytime.. we chatted almost 24 hours .. jus got break when slept or something imp. to be done.. but things changed too fast.. really too much fast.. we had a long distance relation he was from delhi.. (19 years his age now!) but we were in same class(12th) that time.. he too liked someone there(his bestie!) ..I thought as the time will pass he will forget him.. but things didnt changed... My bofy liked his bestie way too much! offcourse i dint like tat..i hated tat guy.. but there was nothing i could do + my bofy ws dominating(i repented on this too late!) .. we started with fights.. more fights by each passing day.. I felt like being side laned..or as mere an option.. though sagar gave me his time.. but there was nothing special feeling.. the love was gone..no more calling shona..baby.. no i love u!.. nothing.. i felt bad.but i kept struggling coz..i started loving him too much + we became addicted to each other..
I then tried to flirt with others.. to make him envy.. but nothing worked.. n finally My limit was reached..I gave up! we broke in 2 months of our relationship..
I knew in heart of hearts..that he loved me too... coz i felt so.. i really felt the love between us..n i knw tat wasnt fake..
I then thought to patch up again as forme it was difficult to live without him.. but then he said me a no.. i was way too sad.. meanwhile..my boards were not tat good.. my examz were all bittered up!!..
N from then.. i believed no one.. I got attached to no one.. even if i tried. nothing happened.. I couldnt fall for anyone.. I tried many relationships.. but nothing worked.. n now ,, I jus feel irritated by me.. what havoc i have created of me..
People fall for me.. but i couldnt. n it feels so bad to say a no even to genuine ppl...:( :( i want some one really for me.. but i am now jus way too much broken.. n afraid.. to sahre myself with anyone else now..:( :(</p>
