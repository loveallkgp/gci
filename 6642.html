<p>Straight guys are far better and sweeter than gays (Sorry fr this) So m 23 a simple next door bubbly and talkative guy And by looks m okay bt bcz of jaundice n tubercluosis last year.I m looking pale now a days i hv turn skinny m still on medications may be i vll be fyn lyk before soon. So after suffering from disease i made acc to remove boredom on fb n decided to befriend some guys..met many make dem feel spl..google things read magazines how to make sm1 feel spl.execute plans properly but all in vain.I nvr try to hv sex or even kiss wd sm1 bcz of my medical condition.I jst wanted a pure friendship but everyone man everyone did same n same i tried wd straights n i gt some really gud frnds n i was thinking straights may find these things odd LOL!! seriously not crying over these things bt we all r sex seekers m asexual so me kahan jau? koi pyaar se sun bhi ni sakta meko?? i dun hv sexy ass i know :D nyways i hv given up lol but ya i hv learn to play guitar just fr a guy to sing happy bdy for him..and funny thing after several meeting just one week b4 from his bdy he said he did nt lyk me he was talking to me just out of courtsey haha.. :) its fyn.. his choice i wont say anything bt atleast jin logo ne first meeting pe bta dia dey were better....mere straights hi sahi hai..m unlucky i born lyk dt ..girls r really sweet i wish i could keep them happy :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Its a sorry state for u not having the fate to meet some really good gay guys from the community but don't jump onto conclusions honey because in reality we all are the same and long for the same thing- to love and to get loved.</h1>
<p>U are asexual as u wrote, well if u really are then there is no point being ashamed of it or hiding it because that is also a truth of the sexual spectrum.
U keeping anyone happy is not dependent on you being gay(if u got it what I mean). U just got to be giving your soul's sprouted emotions into that person; that suffices all.</p>
<p>Always be with those kind of people with whom you grow regardless of their orientation, then you will truly understand that labels doesn't always work as we think they do.
Hugs and cheers sweety!</p>
