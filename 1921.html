<p>I was just thinking..
Darwin always talked about natural selection and said ''the fittest species survives in the end'' where for 'fittest' he meant reproductive health.
So, to survive, our genes changed according to our needs and increased our reproductive ability. We survived. But then we started developing technologies and enhanced science to decrease mortality rate and increase birth rate. And then we started increasing in population which inturn turned into a serious problem.
If we think it this way... Our human species was fighting with itself for the basic needs. Now lets put forth natural selection here. To maintain our population and to survive against our own species nature started selecting people. Genes modified themselves and made people gay, bi, pansexual, asexual etc... So we could survive against ourselves..
In short, it means.. You reading, YOU are SPECIAL, the saviour of humans.. ;)
hehe, these thoughts make my mind giggle and loose it's weights at least for few moments.. :D</p>
<h1>GCI- I think the same that we as gay people have the responsibility to keep the population under control. But anyways, do we need more reasons for our existence? Aren't there already enough?</h1>
