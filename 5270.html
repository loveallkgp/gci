<p>hi admin..</p>
<p>i have a group of 6 friends in my clg.. we are so close to each other.. but I'm not an open gay so even they don't know about it..</p>
<p>but recently through a gay friend i came to know that one of my bestest friend is into men also.. but I'm acting as if i don't know anything .. n my gay friend is telling me to say this things to him.. he(gay frend) said to me to tell that I'm into guys too to him.</p>
<p>I'm feeling so awkward to tell things to a friend whom i know from last 4 years.. suddenly how can i tell him these things! even if i tell him n then if he stops talking to me? if he feels shy to be close like before? urrggg.</p>
<p>what should i do? let it be constant or m i doing wrong even after knowing this?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, if he told you things about your friend, what's the guarantee that your friend does not know things about you?</h1>
<p>The thing that bothered me in your confession is that you think that if you both come out to each other, things will go awkward for you both. Can you tell me how? If any of my friend comes out to me I will be like. "Great! Now we know each other more better", and that would only strengthen the bond of our friendship. Don't just think that gay people cannot be friends. My best friends came out to me and now we are like brothers after 15 years of friendship.</p>
