<p>After having sex,</p>
<p>I feel some attachment with my sex partner. </p>
<p>_i think of him..want him as my love..</p>
<p>&amp; max. Cases, things don't work!
As its just a sex date, all r forget me after sex!
&amp;
I'm the poor one who allow to grow this stupidity_again again!</p>
<h1>GCI : who tells you to be stupid and sleep with everybody . see when you are hungry you go out to search for food but do you just pick any random thing to eat??? no ... what you actually do is ... you know what you like and you will go to that shop or restra to eat ... again you will tell them what you want in it suppose pizza... 'extra cheese ' , no spice and all.</h1>
<p>so when you don't do any compromise on what you eat why you compromise on whom you want ??? to get aright thing on plate you must have patience and dignity . </p>
<p>and there is a rule of dating 6 months or 1 year before jumping into bed with someone ... if a guy can have this much patience means he is looking for relationship and will do anything to work. ( but ofcourse if you often end up in one night stands then darling you need to recalculate your own standards ..don't blame others for using you " :)</p>
