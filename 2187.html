<p>Hi guys, I think this is a confession maybe a cry for help or advice, I don't know you guys decide. I promised myself that I wouldn't get close to someone as I'm gay and I know the reality is that it's something which I will have to hide for the rest of my life. I know what u guys are going to say that it's wrong and in this day and age I shouldn't do that or that I'm a coward. I accept all of the above but the fact still remain as a Muslim it's forbidden and I value the dignity of my parents a great deal so couldn't put them through the pain of it. Beside my father is terminal with cancer and has months with us. Well iv met some he's also a Muslim and in the same sort of predicament as I am in. He's in love with me I think and I know I am most definitely in love with him. We spend a considerable amount of time together. Doing various things not only sex but like going for a bite to eat or watching a movie etc. He's always said to me not to get close to him as hes lived a very normadic lifestyle and he can move on quickly if the situation arises. I don't blame him for that because he came to the UK as a student and many of his friends have left due to visa issues, so I can understand why he doesn't get close to anyone. His present situation is no different he's waiting to see if he get indefinite leave to remain or else he would have to go back to Pakistan. The problem is that I have gotten very close to him. I pine every moment for contact with him, wait for his txt messages or a call. I feel useless because I can't do anything all day and just think about him and watch my mobile. I hate it. I'm very successful in my job but feel that I'm neglecting it and just spend the day thinking is he going to call or txt or why has he not called or txt. It's driving me up the wall. I get jealous when he's with his other mates and spending time with them, despite the fact that he just spent a couple of hours with me. I can't stand it anymore. What should I do</p>
<h1>GCI : see me being a curious guy .. i always read about religions . be it about jews , muslims , hindus , christians or budhism .. and i am myself sikh . 'gay sex' , or 'gay relations' are banned in every other religion . specialy i know that in bible its written . and i know that muslim society and religion is very strict and gay relation is considered ' HARAM'.</h1>
<p>but again we all have parents .. we all have the same fears . we all have fear that our parenst will get into shame .. my parents are old too and i fear that my telling them this on't put them in any health risk .but again ask yourself why you should be ashamed for loving . why you should feel fear when you are not doing anything wrong ? why don't you feel proud of your identity ??? just because people say so ??</p>
<p>on the good side you are in UK . so don't loose hope . i have seen so many women who belong to islam but have decided to break some laws made by society and live their life like they want . why can't you break few .  its about your life . se ammi and abbu one day they will get old and they will leave this world ... then it will be all about you ... would you really spend the rest of life with a girl ?? do you really wanna give preference to people over your happiness . ??</p>
<p>and let me tell you 'god ' will not judge you ... he never will . people forget what 'religious ' books preach . they preach ' acceptance ' , ; love' , humbleness , care.</p>
