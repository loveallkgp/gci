<p>Hi Admin.. Huge Fan.. Wanted to ask something..</p>
<p>I have a friend from college, actually he is junior to me... Wenever we hang out its all fun nd all... I am actually attracted to this guy.... Wen we sleepover at friends place i try to stay close to him nd all.. He sometimes stares at me nd i feel like he gives me signal.. Bt i dnt have the courage to act on it.. I feel scared wat if i am reading the signals wrong.. Yesterday night nly many of our frnds were drinking nd all nd he gt really drunk.. I stayed beside him nd comforted him... nd during dat tym he gave me a all so confusing look.... I also slept beside him bt i did nthng.. I could have done nythng i like coz he was out cold nd was wearing boxers nly bt i controlled myself.... I am really confused... Coz we talk abt girls nd all wen we hang out... Bt i also feel all this signals frm him... Please tell me wat to do....</p>
<h1>GCI- Let him give you signals to make you sure that he is interested in you. Meanwhile if you really think that he gave you a hardcore signal, then jump on him!</h1>
