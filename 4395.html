Its been had 2-3 yrs with the contact with one of my colligue to whom with M just fall for.. I just Love him So much &amp; many a times I way out my feelings in front of him by saying my desires in jokes &amp; of course as always he just talk tangentially as to avoid the thaughts to be entered in mind of ther guys with us always. I personally messaged him about my emotions many a times &amp; he knows well this too. Bt, he had girlfriend at that time &amp; he avoids my messages, may b due to her. Its okay. But, now theres he hd break up with his GF &amp; just single. He trying to deny always to have my touch, bt I had seen his desires about me &amp; also experienced his heavy actions about to overcome me on bed with no sense of desires that like on bef. He alwsys had attraction over me as he always wanders arround me in free times evn in busy times for changeover. But, dont know he always trying to avoid that feelings in actions &amp; as our third friend is always with us &amp; they both are room mates too. He denies about the same in communication also...but, he always burning his desires due to have fear of the image spoilage may be...I thinks so...
So, please tell me guys how do I make him realise about my feeling towards him practically as I tried all things like conveyed my thaughts, helped him much as I can, &amp; also tried to be with one another lonely. Bt, still I couldnt just hugged, kissed or stick him with my sensible emotions that I have towards him.
I really Loves him so much &amp; I wanna to be in his arms. M just dying daily by seeing, talkin, &amp; spending time with him. Please tell me, how do I get him realised all these of my desires..? Please Help Me admin &amp; guys.........!!
