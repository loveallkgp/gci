<p>BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP </p>
<p>When we meet someone, whom we starts feeling close.
We start feeling that person special without knowing what actually is going on in his mind.
Then we starts getting positive vibes from him and we get into something we call as LOVE... &lt;3
And all of the sudden we go to that GUY and tell him that YEAH I LOVE YOU...
And he replies with a very descent face that HE LOVE YOU TOO.... </p>
<p>Things starts to move on very good, We starts building our dreams with that guy... 
Spending your life, you love, your body, your everything on HIM...</p>
<p>However all of the sudden he starts changing, but you trusted him, you trusted his love, you TRUSTED YOUR LOVE, YOU TRUSTED YOUR GOD...
But you never thought what was actually in his mind, You just TRUSTED HIM....</p>
<p>When he did the same thing again, you finally thought to ask him IF EVERYTHING IS GOING FINE...
and Again with his descent face he says YEAH HE LOVE YOU...AND EVERYTHING IS FINE....
But something else was in his mind...</p>
<p>and Finally a day come when you catch him with someone else and you starts thinking of YOUR LOVE, YOUR GOD, HIS LOVE, HIS DESCENT FACE and his words "YEAH I LOVE YOU"....
when today he was just saying "YEAH I USED YOU"....</p>
<p>I know this kind of incidents do happen now a days... 
Is there something we called  LOVE &lt;3 is still left in our COMMUNITY???
Is there something we called RELATIONSHIP &lt;3 is still left in our COMMUNITY???</p>
<p>and If we feel that the answer is NO, Don't we think that we are the only reason behind it???</p>
<p>Its a request to every member of OUR COMMUNITY....
LOVE, RELATIONSHIP- try to understand the meaning of these words and don't hurt anyone cuz the believe in YOUR LOVE, believe in HIS LOVE and believe in GOD is FADING somewhere... </p>
<p>and reason behind this is only we people -  PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY....</p>
<p>So LOVE TRULY, LOVE MADLY...
Cuz LOVE IS DIVINE and LOVE IS RESPECT...</p>
<p>P.S -  I LOVE YOU ALL....</p>
<h1>GCI- I dont agree on ur point of PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY...it is only assholes who must be beaten blue and black like him.....but remember people can be very nice and very destructive for some at the same time without even knowing it or acting mr. right.</h1>
<p>There are some people out there who are good but no goodness can be expected out of their actions...(TRUE HYPOCRITES)</p>
