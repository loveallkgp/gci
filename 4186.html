<p>I grew up in the remotest of places in India. My father was an Administrative Officer, so we moved around quite a lot with him and never had a chance of proper schooling. I used to take private coaching and attend the exams in schools. This arrangement restricted my friend circle. I never had a friend, nor I needed during my childhood. The orderlies and their kids would play with me, but they always kept safe distance. Everything changed when I joined Engineering.</p>
<p>2003, Delhi, India
I was a good student and got into a premier residential institute. I had to leave my home, finally. Initial days were tough, but I got involved in many activities of my interest that kept me busy. May be my personality was grave or I was focussed too much on studies, but no one became my friend, although everyone was nice to me.</p>
<p>In 1st year vacation, I took up an internship for which I stayed in my relatives house in another state. I did not like there, so tried to contact a classmate who was from that city. During the 2 months of vacation we spent a lot of time together watching movies, going to malls, game stations, restaurants etc. On the last day, his family invited me for dinner. The dinner was very nice and his parents were cordial. My uncles vehicle broke-down, so he could not pick me up. And finally it was decided that I would spend the night there.</p>
<p>His house was small, so we had to share his room and bed. We were very tired from roaming the entire day and we slept quickly. In the middle of the night I woke up from the hot blow of his breath on my face. He was hugging me in sleep. It was the first time someone was so close to me physically. I felt very warm. I slid close and gripped him tighter. I don't know when I slept, but it is still an unforgettable moment. The next day was normal and I left for my home.</p>
<p>College started and we got busy in studies. He and I had different branches, so we had separate classes and dorms. For almost an year we did not meet as often, until the next vacation. I had limited knowledge about sexuality then and I always knew hetero-sex was the only way. For me he was kind of brother, so when he planned his internship in my city and I offered him to stay at my house.</p>

I recently came across this community and thought it is a nice opportunity to share my life story. However, this is getting longer. So let me know, if you like and want to hear more.
I am in my late 20's and my story spans over 10 years, so it will require at least two more posts like this. My story doesn't have an end yet, cause we are still alive.</p>
