<p>I'm proudly gay and a big time introvert. I value emotional and metal connection. Physical intimacy comes next. This I what made me different from my peers. I have always been away from hometown for studies. Whenever I visit home, I end up connecting with a great guy and we chat endlessly and I always had to leave even before getting to now about the guy. The emotional bond always keeps us going. We long for each other and wait for the day we could meet but it is not possible for me as I get drowned in my schedule. We remain faithful to each other. I do suggest an open relationship till we meet because I feel guilty for holding up the other guy. Once it so happened that we had a fight and broke up. The next time I visited, I made friends with another great guy and we are in a long distance relationship now. The guy with whom I broke up and my present boy friend have a common friend and the three keep discussing about me. My boy friend keeps asking me questions about the " news" he got from the common friend about my previous relationship and I don't know how to respond to it. I would like to be private but all this exchange of information is rubbing me on the wrong side.</p>
<h1>GCI- Rubbing you on the wrong side, huh... That sounds something funny. They sounds like a typical queens. But before everyone jump on my nerves, I used to do the same. I was once a gossip queen.</h1>
<p>If you don't like the things they are saying about you, stay away from people like that. Or you can do something better! Say things about the other person! That's always better! :*</p>
