<p>I had a huge crush on of my friends who doesn't give a fuck abt my feelings. He hurted me in many ways and humiliated me whenever I expresd my love on him. so I decided to give up on him, but dis tym im damn serious. I always wanted to show him dat I'm not a person to be looked down and I'm not a weakling just becoz I loved him, so I did sumthing bad to prove it but still I'm proud of it. I recently came to know that he is seeing someone, a girl who happend to be in my unit at work, so I made friendship with her, impressed her in many ways and guess what, she proposed to me dis evng and she said she had crush on me ryt from the beginning. somehow she made my day, I'm feeling so confident nw, though I couldn't say yes to the girl  I'm so excited wat wd my prince charming do once he knows abt dis..</p>
<h1>gci- And what about the girl? You used her as a tool for your revenge. You could have said everything on his face.</h1>
