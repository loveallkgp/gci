<p>Dear Admin, atleast there is a page to share this,</p>
<p>He is straight and all this straight gay nonsnese I didnt know back in my college when i was 21. He is going to get married to a girl in few days. He is from Indian Navy. I somehow wished that I will get him in my life. The world will vanish in a flash, if I happened to see him. Omg, his light blue shirt and purple shirt, still in my mind :)</p>
<p>Such a wonderful man he is, but i coudnt join hands with him because I am a guy, but my love on him is true and divine.</p>
<p>Every single day in the college, I used to go to his block in the name of drinking tea, just to see him, What a man, he is. An angel sent from heaven. I still remember his last bye and farewell notes. He mentioned me as " caring fellow" :)</p>
<p>He knows me very well, told him "love you" many a time.. May be he might have taken in brotherly sense. He is truly a hero and use to call him that way. I was his junior in college and i somehow imagined that I would catch his hands one day. Got literally shocked to see his wedding invitation in fb.</p>
<p>What lese I can do, rather than just hiding my feelnigs for him :)
No admin, certain things cannot be forgotten in life. He is a fairytale, that part of my life was a one long beautiful dream.</p>
<p>I wanna wish him all the very best to his new life and wife. It seems she is his love. I want her to take care of him just like how would I take care of him</p>
<p>Because I loved you, I started to love my country. Thanks for that sweetheart. lets both serve the nation in different ways. if you happened to read this by chance, please know that, i love you will all my heart, my man, my love on you is as big as this universe.</p>
<p>Love you Hero, with all my heart ! :) &lt;3 Its an ever lasting fairy tale, my man. will always be loving you. missing you with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>No console, no "its fate yaar", no "are leave it" will not work. this cannot be cannot be cannot be compensated. know i can come out of it, but it takes time and its such a sweet thing ocured in my life. I am fortunate and happy for that. Thanks for posting. </p>
<h1>GCI- Every fairy tale has an ending after which you have to close that book and start with a new one. So when you open a new one, make sure that it ends happily for you. :)</h1>
