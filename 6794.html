<p>Hii everyone ! I feels today to share my feelings with you all! Guys I don't know why? But I had been with 5 months with him and feeling now like yes I m in love with him. But this only one sided love Don't know he loves me or not? Actually he calls me sometime for no reason and when I call back again him he sd "nahi bas aise hi" ..I think it means a lot. This is the first guy whim I had called in love . He had a classes of own in which we all teaches and slowly I had called in live with him Yesterday to touch him I sd him give your forehead I will massgae it ...he sd OK and then he fell asleep on my stomach and then I massaged him ...I told him do the same with me....it was an awesome feeling like bf and gf....what should I do....? I cannot live without him ....</p>
<h1>GCI- Wait what?! GF BF thingy in ur life and u have started to swoon and drool just because u r having something romantic with a guy who hasn't confirmed anything???Talk to him one fine day about it, express and see whether he is ready to invest the same kind and amount of emotions and please for god's sake stop following Katy Perry's Teenage dreams so much, u will land up to Taylor Swift's We are never ever gonna be back together very soon if you keep on practicing teeny twee feelings in love. Love is a very broad term, remember this.</h1>
