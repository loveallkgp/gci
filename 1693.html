<p>Hello all,
I am in a long distance relationship and we are together for about 5 years. I am bisexual and my bf is gay. Last time we met, I was casually looking at some girls. I work in customer services and we have to wear a smile on our face all the time. That's part of the job. I have been in this job for more than
4 years. So I do pass smile whenever someone is looking at me irrespective of someone's gender or age. My bf thinks that I was hitting on those girls by passing a smile. He is accusing me of this. It's not something that I do on purpose. It happens and I don't realize that I am doing it. Until he make me realize it. I love him very much and don't want to upset him. Can you guys guys suggest what should I do.
Thanks
Regards</p>
<h1>Viv- Uhhh you tried talking to him about the reason? If not, then do so fast! Otherwise if he gets angry just kiss him to show him your affection. A kiss can do a lot. ;)</h1>
