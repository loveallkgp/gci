<p>Hello. I'm 17 years old. I am gay. Or so I thought. I was convinced I was gay. I even came out as gay to my friends. I always thought I'd date guys and eventually settle down and have a family with a guy. I want to date a guy who's nice and smart. So, I don't have any form of guilt over my orientation. But talking to a female friend of mine, all I could think about was kissing and undressing her. She was talking about something. Sounding really smart. I'm a sapiosexual(attracted to smart people). So may be being attracted to her was my subconscious trying to make me believe I'm straight or at least attracted to girls. I've never been very sexually attracted to girls. I get easily turned on by guys but I sometimes fancy girls. I mean, I'm gay but once in a while I fantasize about being with a girl. I've never had sex, so I don't know what I actually like sexually. I've been romantically interested in girls but never with a guy. I'd date a guy, fall in love with him, but I've never just fallen for a guy, gay or straight.  I do get crushes on girls. It's all so confusing. I like a new girl. She incredibly smart and we could talk for hours. When we're close, I feel like kissing her and undressing her and I just can't stop thinking about it. Sometimes I wonder if I just like smart girls 'cause I'd like a smart partner to have a financially luxurious life as we'll both earn. Or just because being with a girl would mean a stable, straight, "normal" relationship. As I'm just 17, an adolescent, it could all be an overload of hormones confusing me. I've heard people being confused over being gay or straight or bi. And most would tell to try and find out for myself. Y'know, explore my sexuality. But for me, sex is not an experiment. It's sacred. And I can't imagine sex out of a relationship, with a guy or a girl. My question is to the gay/bi guys. Did you ever experience anything of this sort? Did you date/sleep with a girl and liked it? Is being bisexual this confusing? I'm completely out of answers. I like guys, I think I'm gay. I also sort of like girls, I think I'm bisexual. I know sexuality is ambivalent. But I don't want this ambiguity. </p>
