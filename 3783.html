<p>Today while watching dare2dance, discussion started why dancers acts this way, talk this way, dress up, etc. here came sushant's topic. then started topic of homosexuality. Being related to medical, i completely explained parents starting from gene to whatever i can blabber about cause if homosexuality. From inside i was shouting 'm gay too'. But always have stopped that coming out of mouth. God knows why. Atleast i could make then understand. May be fear. M damn sure they have a doubt regarding me. Mum even asked me many times when i postpone my marriage-issue 'do u even like girls?' At those time my words got stuck somewhere not coming out of mouth. Dad have had always been silent in topic of postponing my marriage. Well, he must have noticed from childhood i was always different. Sister &amp; even brother-in-law knows &amp; have said let this go for now &amp; do call us when this topic gets in discussion in parents regarding my homosexuality. Many such multiple chances,l i got,  but words cant get out of my mouth 'm gay too, m gay so m postponing marriage'. God knows why, words fail to come out. Going with the flow. Lets see whats thr next &amp; when could i utter simple words then starts discussion &amp; sister, brother-in-law n me could get them convinced for what i m. I was born this way. Btw, m 27</p>
