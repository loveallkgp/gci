<p>22, Delhi
i have been living with my boyfriend since past few months . we are from same college but my college is over now and i ll be leaving the city soon.its sad to even think about how am gonna survive without him and shit . anyways i wanted to ask something here . few days back we were at this gay party , dancing and enjoying but i felt he was checking out other guys way too much like m not there at all . which led to an arguement there cause we have been to parties before but he never acted like this . when we were arguying i gave him an example of his brothers relationship like would your brother be okay with his girlfriend checking out other guys like he is not there at all . so in his defense his last statement was ' we are guys ' , we are not like those couples . I was furious after that , it could have been easy to over look this thing but the statement , i mean seriously is it ok to think like that??
i truly love this guy and he has been always faithful to me , we are in love truly and i know he is the one. so i would want to talk to him about this but not sure how to without loosing my composure . and m not overthinking right ?? what he said is wrong ?</p>
<h1>GCI- He was indeed wrong for saying that. In a way he implied that feelings between two guys can never equal those which are between a guy and a girl. You boyfriend is still not okay with the idea of being in a relationship. Somewhere in his head he feels low for being gay. You have to root it out and that's where awareness should come in. Being in a relation is fine, you guys are doing a great job. You both should also know what efforts our fellow LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters did decades ago, so that we could have our freedom of action and awareness.</h1>
<p>I know it may sound absurd right now, but I think knowing about history is an important factor if you want to live together with pride. Otherwise the thoughts of being low, as fed to us by society and orthodox people all around, will take a toll on you.</p>
