Hi admin,
Today i am going to share something which hurt the most to me.You know,i wish i was never born in earth.i was chatting with one of the guy in fb and when he heard me in call,he said"You don't sound heavy,you sound soft",and immediately after that i stopped talking.you know,i wish ki meri voice bhi other guys ki tarah heavy hoti.i know,i am never gonna find any boyfriend,coz i sound soft.when i used to work in one of the office,one of the voice and accent female trainer said,"why i act so sophisticated like a girl,when i am about to speak something?she said this infront of all trainees and i felt so embarrassed,that i was literally looking down with tears in my eyes.after sometime,i went to the washroom and cried.i don't feel confident,the way i sound.i wish,i would have been born with a 100 percent quality of a guy.i feel god ne hi discriminate kiya hain,toh log toh karenge hi.kaash mera bhi voice heavy hota toh itna embarrasment nahi jhelna padta.</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe it's time you make peace way with it? It's not God who is discriminating. It's you who are discriminating against yourself. You are making yourself weak. And that is all a result of patriarchy in the system. People think that females are weak and all and if you are feminine or have a soft voice you are give a synonym of a lesser identity. Rather than your voice which should hardly be a concern for you, focus on your accomplishments. Next time if anyone says anything to you just reply, "Thanks for the compliment. I love my sophisticated attitude. Wish some people over here had it too." Na kisi ka face bana ya log sharminde hue to mera naam badal dena.</h1>
