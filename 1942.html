<p>Hi admin,
My friend is in love with a guy who lives abroad. They are in on and off realtionship for last 4 years or so. That guy has cheated on my friend a lot of times. Everytime he has been hurt but eventually my friend returns back to him. I fear that one day he will leave my friend for a girl since he is bisexual. He will call him once in a while and never calls back for some days. I find it very hard that he even loves my friend. Recently they have patched together. I fear that my friend is again going to get hurt by him. He just tried to came out to his family but was unsuccessful. My friend considers this as a big deal and trusts him a lot. I tried to warn everytime we meet but my friend says that his lover is changed. I find it very hard to believe. Their history makes me doubt. Coz when my friend is hurt, he is bitter and alone. I can't see him again like that. Guys please advice how can I help him?
PS: Both my friend and his partner are here on GCI. I want the best for my friend.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, confessor's friend, if you are in a toxic relationship you must surely get out of it. And if the guy is constantly cheating on you then sure as hell you have to leave him. Who is to say that he won't do again? Love is blind I know but you don't have to leave your sense in a mud pool and be a dumb person to not see what is going on around you. Be NOT a blind fool. To the confessor, its only he who can help himself. You can make efforts to make him understand but at the end its his decision that counts,</h1>
