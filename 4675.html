<p>This may sound funny but I just want to share something about myself. I am 24 now. 5-6 years back I realised that I am bisexual (at present I am at a stage where I am 99% gay as I get attracted to guys the most). There was a time when I used to be very flirty and flamboyant (till the age of 22). But over the last two years I have become a bit introverted. I hardly feel like dating anyone or even chatting with strangers. I have always craved for a stable life for the last two years. Like having a sweet guy as my life partner who will be my world. I met a guy 8 months back with whom I'm having a relationship. But we are having a lot of problems 'cause he is still a kid (he is just 19). He is very flamboyant. He loves making a lot of gay friends and spending time with them. And most of those guys try to pamper him; they are well aware that he is already having a boy friend, still they ask him out and flirt with him. Is this really normal or am I just getting over-possessive about him ? Just share your views.</p>
<h1>GCI- Do you both have mutual trust? If yes then there is nothing to feel over possessive about. It is natural to get insecure. But at the end of the day give him time to get mature. It will take some time but he will reach there just like you did.</h1>
