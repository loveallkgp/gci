<p>Hey I am 22 guy from Delhi... This is my 2nd confession here so far... Ill start with as it was holi today so wish u all Happy Holi... smile emoticon</p>
<p>I had fever since the morning so didnt wanted to play holi... but some of my friend came... took me out... we went to 1 of my friend's society as it had a holi party organised... loud music... dance... all age people... enjoying the celebration.</p>
<p>And then there I saw this gym friend of mine who lives in the same society which i didnt knew earlier... he is really hot... stud guy... his dad is my mom's office colleague... our family know each other very well... but i meet him 1st in d the gym only... as he was in abroad most of the time... n just settled down with his family now... his has been to my house many a times... So we started playing holi all together... it was a wonderful time having to be with all my old friends... even i forgot my fever for a while tongue emoticon</p>
<p>Then at a moment I got a call n went in the side to attend so... n in the middle of my call this guy came to me n asked me to come with him to get some colors... so i went to his house... n saw no1 was there... as all of his family was out in the society park... n we started searching colors in his room... n then all go a sudden he grabed me... n kissed... i didnt had even a sec to think... i know even i liked it... as i didnt resisted.. but somehow got to know that he was drunk... i was pushed him n asked about the drink... n he said yes i am drunk... so what... i straight away went out... n luckily my friends were just about to leave... so we left while he came back with the colors... then i didnt at all looked back at him.</p>
<p>The problem is i think that he was drunk... thats why he did so... n i just got to know he has a gf too... he just did that all out of his lust... n i coz of my liking... I dont want to repeat that again... even dont want to see that shit head ever... i m not running for sex... but long for a genuine n good person to be with... I just want to know your views... was all I did was right or not ?_?</p>
