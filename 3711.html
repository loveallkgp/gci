<p>DISCLAIMER: This is a weird and sick post. Please read it at ur own risk.</p>
<p>Its not a confession, but something weird and sick that I discovered last night while on PR. I came across this profile of a person who claimed to be a submissive bottom slave. Well, people are different. So, that's okay. I was going through my search but there was something about this profile pic that I felt like checking the profile and see the pic. Creepy it was!! The profile content mentioned that this person wanted his partner to piss and shit in his mouth. GROSS. SICK. YUCKY.</p>
<p>It was none of my business but I cudn't hold back, and I wrote to him, and asked to him to seek professional help if needed. Crazy! He showed his shitty attitude and blocked my profile.</p>
<p>WOYAAKKK.</p>
