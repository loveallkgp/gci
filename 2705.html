<p>Well i dnt knw anyone gonna read it or not but i just want a clear a answer from admin. So here it goes cant take it any more.
Well everyone loves there family same does i.They love me same. No one want there parents to go against them or they go against parents..So almost every guy dnt wanna comeout to them.. And admin said it right that no need to comeout till u got ur mate who will hold ur hand. Bt do you this is that much easy? Finding a guy who will really be with u and not cheat you.. Where peoples requirments are like m hot hunk need top/bot,i dnt have place call me if u have,soft bottoms,hot tops,tyt ass,thick cock,muscular body ,feminine body, below 30 above 40 etc etc where homosexual hate each other no girly guy,no chubby guy no thin guy hairless guy etc etc etc(neva ending requirments) going in the typical areas and do whatever,in toilets.people use pr for other local area guys how many have find a guy who wants a reltn frm pr may be 1 from 100 i gues PR the wrost site ever.Findng love between cheaters,sluts,whores.  when usa accepted homosexualty My mom was like people r finding their own destruction. i find it better option nt to tell her about me. Well how many moms wil be its ok and accept it well there is difference between love and acceptence. even how many of us dnt think why m diffrnt or why m homesexual.?. people r like wait for ryt tym?when wil the bulshit ryt tym wil arrive? trunning into 60s? relatnshps are like joke now a days..<br>
maybe admin ur like concentrate ur study jobs work bt these frustratn and deppresns r just broking me. do u really have answer of all these?</p>
<p>GCI : why i say to concentrate on your studies and jobs is because its my personal thinking that's when you are independent financially .
its clear not all parents will accept you being gay . parents don't accept us when we marry a girl or guy from different religion , so bringing another man is a like throwing grenade at them . 
but one day you have to come out and if you have job and career , in case if your family creates a big issue or throws you out or threat to kill you then you can easily live on your own . nobody will be able to force you .</p>
<p>and next thing is , yes so many people on pr asking for all such things rich guys , muscular men , handsome men ..and they all are living in fantasy . ( let me tell you they all end up getting into bed with regular men and next day they will start finding for another end up into same) . and don't forget there are people who want a normal guy and a love and marriage . so don't stress yourself as you will find somebody someday and  guys on pr will be still there asking for fantasy men and end up single.</p>
