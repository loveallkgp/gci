<p>I was 12 years old, skinny, with bones hanging from every core of my body. I was in the 8th grade. He was 33 years old, dark skin, very handsome, with a muscled body a so called 12 year or even a teen would die for. We were neighbors at that time! He would work out, gyming at home then. Somewhere one day I happen to look to his window, what I saw was something any right guy would feel at that moment. He was working out, sweating hard right before my eyes! I didn't think about erection or being attracted to guys at 12 years old. But here, before my eyes stood his smiling-at-me 33 handsome muscled sweating man, I felt my cock grew quickly hard standing erect to my skinny stomach! I was attracted to him, I felt in love with him instantly!
What followed me next, I can't remember, but I knew I called him to my place, when I was alone, some days after I first laid my eyes on him. He came after sweating out, sweating profusely. I remember touching his sweaty chests and biceps, abs and even his getting-hard-at-my-touch cock.
That night he called to his place, despite his folks were at him. I enter unnoticed into his toilet, we kisses, we touched, then came the big one ... sucking each other and fucking each other.
I never felt great like that, knowing he was mine and I was his! It was the first a 12 year old got fucked a 33 year old with a massive thick cock, I was in heaven! He allowed to fuck him to, showed how to enter his love hole! We spent about 1 hour the first time.
It started some things, I would never forget, for as long I may live. We shared a mutual trust and love for each other after our first time! We used no condoms as we do now! We shared love, sex and feeling for each other, in my home or in his home. We didn't care a damn if our family's were at home or not. We entered each house, went into our bedrooms. locked the door, and until were satisfied with one and another, we withdrew.
This cared on for 2 years and maybe about 8 or 9 months plus! I was in 11th grade at that time. He was my boyfriend, my lover, my whole life was in his hands, He taught me how to gym, how to make love to another man. He was 101% gay, I knew that I was born to be gay, just like him!
He left one day, going back to his native place, near Bangalore. I have never ever seen him again. I miss him so much, as I write these words, to whoever reads them, I wish one day he would walk into my waiting arms to hug him, to kiss him, to make love to him, like we did for the very first time!
I've moved on, had thousands of sex partner, thousands of lovers, thousands of boyfriends. You name them, I've had them all! I'm currently living, engaged to the man of my life! I love him with heart, soul and body!
But if Creole comes back, it's goodbye to Noah, whether we get married or not!
Come back My Creole! I'm crying I want let go of you, forever.
I'm 37 today, he is 60!
I Love him, I Want him, I Need him!</p>
<h1>GCI- Thousands? -_- That's more grasping than the news of pig's 30 min long orgasm.</h1>
