<p>Hello criminals!!!!
well I dont know what I really want to confess. But I will just go with the flow. By the way I am a punjabi gay guy. Life has been pretty good till now. There has been many ups and downs but overall life is beautiful. I have good friends with whom I share everything but no such friend to whom I can tell about my homosexuality. I am good in academics and a well known guy in the college, and I suck in sports :p Sitting here in front of the computer at the cyber cafe I am unable to figure out whether if I really have any problems in life or not. And the answer is a NO!!! I dont think I have any such thing in life about which I should feel sad. I think I will get a nice job in future. My parents provide whatever I "require" in my life. The best thing I like about myself is i cant remain sad for a long time. I mean I dont think much about the downs of my life.
I like watching movies, going out with friends, doing very crazy stupid things and blah blah.
The first physical xperience I had in my life was at the young age of about 13. It was with a friend. Not sex, we just had mutual bjs and nothing has ever happened in my life after that awesome experience :p ;) I had been in a LDR with a guy. We had never met each other. It lasted for about a month. It was one of the best part of my life.
I havent met many guys from fb. Just 3 guys. I am not very fond of meeting people without knowing them properly first.
The one of the best things I have done in my life is creating this ID. I have come across people from different backgrounds. Making this ID has made me a better person . I have realized people are not perfect. NO ONE IS. Everyone has flaws. I have become more accepting. I have realized that I cry about silly problems of my life and there are people who have been sexually abused,raped,who are orphan,poor but are still strong. People have come and gone from my life but this journey will go on forever. I am happy that I am gay bcos it has taught me a lot, that everyone is unique!! One thing I would like to tell you guys is that if you want others to accept you than learn accepting others too. Moving to the topic of " coming out" , I am waiting for the right age. I dont want to marry a girl. I dont know how will I be able to come out but why should I think about it so much now? I want to enjoy my present.</p>
<p>I need a guy in my life but I am not in a hurry. I have been rejected and have rejected others too. Jab pyar hona hoga ho jeaga. Pehle khud se toh pyar krlu. &lt;3. LOVE TO EVERYONE . SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE.</p>
