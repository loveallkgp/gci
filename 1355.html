<p>Hai....
am in relationship wid a guy frm last six months.....n at da Middle around 2 months back he was bit busy wid some work n he din gave time fa me.....n i thought he was ignoring..,n i never understood him......n i decided my self to come out off him.....to do that ,,for a fist time i created PR account n even i uploaded ma original face pics.....,,there i hv got many proposals n even i dated wid one guy,,,,but the fact is that i am not abled to see someone in his plc then i realized that how much am lovin him!!!!!!...n i understood ma mistake,,decided to be wid him forever.....everything happened well....n i ignored ma PR id......
but now ma boyfriend's frind saw me on PR n told him that am usin PR.....
my guy felt very bad,,,even he cried n asked me wtz da problem? Y u searchin someone else.?n etc etc....but am speechless..,i din opened ma lips...
then he was pretty annoyed for two days n after that he nly came hugged me to forgive everything n asked me to not to repeat this again.......but am feelin too guilty for wt i did...and am not abled to speak wid him properly ..,n even am not abled to look at his eyes.....
this is killin me every second......but i love him,,i can't live wid out him......
how to become normal wid him.......???????</p>
<h1>Viv- Have a talk with him about all of this. Speak your heart while you spend a day with him. Tell him that you love him and you mean it. Things will definitely fall into place. Talking helps, trust me.</h1>
