<p>Its truely said dat, ku6 bhi ho sakta he...
M 23 from Bangalore...
Due to busy job life, few days back i oredered underwears from flipkart which were to be delivered today. In evening, as usual i returned from office to my room. My others mate had not came yet. I came to room, got fresh and was wearing vest and short. After 20 minutes door bell rang. I opened the door &amp; there was a deliery boy at door step. An average looking, tall, fair boy with nice smile wss front to me.I called him inside n offered water. Then he handed over me my parcel and signature slip. I was checking shipment bill n signatures, suddenly he asked, what you have oredered. I said, its underwears. He mischeviously said, why dnt yoy try it and check fittings and size. I got his point. I said ok just wait 2 minutes. I went inside and came out wearing my new park avenue underwear with my jard tool trying to peep out of it. I went to him and asked hows it. What could he say, I just grabbed him into my arms and a just kissed him. Thats what he wanted. I took him to my bedroom. We both are top bt just had a quality time. Soulful sex after a long working day is just awesome.. Very soon he left and now m panicing with his memories. Kyu koi achanak dil ke pass aakar chala jata he. I have his number. Very much positive for our next meeting very soon.</p>
