<p>continuation of confession #3148
i dont want anyone else's love. we hav had such a great time togedr(though for a very short period of time) that its now impossible for me to forget those things...u only think can u evr forget sumone who had shed tears for u, took u home safely when u were drunk and completely sloshed, called u everynight just to ask ur well being when u were in the hospital fighting death..but then all the things he did were just becoz he cared for me as a frn nd i fell in love. i know he might have his own reasons for not having "love" wali feelings for me but i have now ruined everythng by telling him the truth. and now the daily bases conversation over phone has curtailed to once in months. sumtime i feel i hav a lost a very good frn by overwhelming myself wid stupid feelings which in real world have no significance, all these things can happen only in movies..am trying again to move to different country where i can be much more occupied to not to think about him but evrytime i think of him now and then about we r gonna be so far just kills me from inside,.</p>
