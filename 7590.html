<p>Post 1:</p>
<p>I love my country I really do and so I don't wanna leave it and get a better life abroad (that's what my parents want) but the kind of life i want will never be available in my country because of some handful of politicians and lawmakers who belong to a prehistoric time, who will never let us live free.</p>
<p>I am a BJP supporter every one in my family is and I love and respect our Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi for the efforts he is making to take our country in a forward direction but I am saddened by him not paying attention to us or our problems. He goes to US and addresses the US Congress by saying that both India and US are great friend coz both the country believes in the fact that ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL and that both the countries gives LIBERTY TO EVERYONE but where is the Liberty of LGBT people. Most people in our Country got free on 15th August 1947 but we are still not free and this ain't right. :|</p>

<h1>GCI- The worst thing that is happening right now in India is that the society has divided. Earlier, we used to focus on the rape issues, black money, uplifting of the poor and the scams were coming out. Now, the entire political air, and the people's attention has shifted to petty issues. For example, beef issue. I believe that some people in the ministry are shifting the focus on the useless issues so that the dumb public, that makes around 70% of the population of the country is easily swayed by make-beliefs.</h1>
