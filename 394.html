<p>18 m</p>
<p>i hav a Facebook friend , he is very good friend of mine and he is good to me also, but he stays at another end of India... i hav proposed him 2times he said he doesn't want relationship with me coz we stay in two different state. he said he will remain as a very good friend for ever.. but i hav felt for him very deeply, whenever he doesn't reply i feel sad n i msg him angry with long texts... and last he replies and make me out...
now days he chats nicely but only 10-15 min a day that even after 12am, he doesn't reply at day time he says he stays busy at day time thats why, but wo pehle kavi busy nhi hota tha! jo v ho if i get angry wo mujhe manata he but after 12am only..</p>
<p>now tell.. did he started to ignore me? is he not interested on me anymore?? these two question always spins on my mind when ge doesn't reply.. plz suggest me good solution what to do!!</p>
<h1>Viv- He is, in a way correct. LDR will be very difficult to maintain. If he puts up a situation try to step into his shoes and understand. Maybe then you will not be pampering him. LOL. If he is your friend then he is bound to make his own decision. Be flexible yaar. If you really want a relation then do find someone who can actually meet you. So do move on from this one.</h1>
