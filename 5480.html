<p>Alert: Sorry this maybe fucking Big ...
As i was standing waiting for my Bus ...there was this usual crowd neither too much nor too less...
and as i looking past the traffic for any sign of bus...suddenly i felt it...actually it took some time to realize but it was him brushing past me slightly touching my crotch...at first i didnt pay much attention then i remembered that face...i dunno wat happen but inside i could feel my breath getting faster...i could literally feel u gazing X-Ray ing me...am not that most handsome guy of sort :p still .... 3rd time "Again him " (1st in train 2nd at platform) I freaked out by his acts...i stepped back...he came near again i stepped to side...i just froze...again he came close i heard him murmur something i acted straight and asked wat...he just kept quite luckily a bus came and then i saw no sign of him again...
He seems pretty educated so i assume he must be here too...See i dont want to insult someone for acting gay in public But wat u have been doing is sometimes creepy...Am not rude not sex seeker too but U can talk to me next time and actual talk plz nor murmuring....
And a question to member is this how a gay finds another one in public? ofcourse his catch was right ;) but do ppl hve to indulge in this acts just to find others orientation :/ Can there be some better way ?</p>
<h1>GCI- I never find a gay person like this, nor do I want to be founded out like this, like ever. That's sexual assault.</h1>
