<p>20, goa
i had a crush on my uncle's youngest son..he is
6years elder then me. tht tym i was around 13
when i saw my 1st porn movie. i was alone
watching until thn he came in suddenly n i was so
a shamed n shy infront of him. i was so scared to
death thinking he might tel my parents.. bt he didn.
the same night he, his elder bro n me ver sleeping
in our hall.i was sleeping in the middle of both
brothers. suddenly i woke up n found myself
sleeping very close to this guy(i seriously have no
idea how i went there) thn i pretended as if i m in
deep sleep n kept my hand on his ribbed abs
(chest).. wow i was in heaven..
n then many things happened except anal n we slept
hugging each other... THE FUNNY PART WAS NEXT
DAY, WE PRETENDED AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT.. :-! i wanna confess that this was
continuing every after 3months each tym he visited
my house.. until last year. now 1year passed he
didn come to my house.. i tried calling him but hez
not recieving my cal</p>
<p>plz help me guys... i turned a straight guy into
bisexual so i cant risk to loose him... i need to knw
how to get him back...
p.s:- i have heard that he is now a police head
constable.. !!!!</p>
<h1>Viv- There is a guilt factor in some "straight" guys who do things with guys. Maybe his moral sense finally kicked in and that's why he is not in your contact anymore. Either way he is not gonna come. I cannot give you false hopes for you to be a doey eyed guy who awaits his long lost love. Better get your hear right and be practical.</h1>
