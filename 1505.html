.
.
.
untill april...i went home for a week ......he came to meet me ..as usual he was fit bright smily...bt I wasn't attracted to him at all..even during the kiss and *** there wasn't that ...that passion....i don't know wats wrong with me ...i mean i read guys crying about being single or not having the perfect bf.....but i have ...a perfect guy..in ever sense...bt this time when i met him there wasn't that "SPARK" 
abby Viv .....he is great guy and if i tell him this he will take on him ...i don't wanna losse my pucchu.......i am going back home for vocation on 15th any suggestions how to reignite the passion the "SPARK"???</p>
<p>$ ABBY : first of all i had to re write so many words as they were written in short form that to in wrong way . !!</p>
<p>plus.. darling its relationship not some investment that when you feel ignited and happy you have it and when u don't feel happy you cut it off . stick to him . i am not coming with ' matchstick and petrol' to ignite fire between you two. well nobody can .</p>
