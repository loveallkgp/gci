<p>5 month passed and nothing change I am still suffering with that pain. Life get fuckd lost all my friends, Career ki maa bhen ho gayi and best thing ki no one care for me.. 
1 year and 2 months ago I meet him
Soon we become friends..he was my roommate. Pata nh kaise bt we get physical to each other. And we start liking each other. (We both are bisexual bt phele kabhi kisike ldke ke sath koi scene nh tha.. 
Haan we hv girlfriends..)
Starting me we were like ki chalo jaisa chl rha h.. Chlne do 1 saal bd sb khatam ho jaiga.. Bt dhere dhere I fell in love with him..  I always need him, Hum humesha sath rhete the.. He is like a small family for me bt unfortunately uska college over and he hd to go back to his home town.. And I can't even stop him. Mujhe pta tha ki its difficult to live without him.. Bt itna difficult hoga ye kabhi nh socha tha... Means I dead from past 5 months and the worst part is that ki he don't even know ki what I am suffering from ki uske bina mera kya haal h and I want him back at anycost.. 
We are just good friends now.. He says ki wo sb aisa nh h.. BTW I don't hv any sexual feeling to him Bt emotional feeling I love him and I can do anything for him..
Bt I need to face the reality ki we never get our second chance.. I wish I could reverse my life and stay forever with him...  He was the best part of my life. Mujhe uski har cheez se pyar h.. The way he talk, The way we walk, The way he look at me... Actually uski buri bate b mujhe ache lagti thi.. All I need to hug him forever.. 
Today m continually crying for last 3 hrs and no one care's for me( ek wo time tha jb ek anshu b nh niklne data tha ).
He left me and I left everyone else... 
At last still I want him back into my life nomatter ki what I have to pay for it.  Love U a lot :*</p>
