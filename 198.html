<p>hi Admin M 24 yrs,
when i was in school, i had some body sex nd all with few of my frnds many times, that time i not even know the word gay or bisexual, but as the time passes i came into college... my access to internet and other thing moves on, i started watching gay porn along with str8t one... then i moved to clg, in 1st year i made a frnd. we became room mates, as i have already done lots of body fun with other guys, i found him quite attractive nd very good by heart also, by second yr we slowly slowly started have having fun with each other, We have never discussed about this in every next morning, every morning we become normal as frnd, but during thoes night we had lots of fun... but no anal till now, we both have girlfrnds, i have done sex with my gf, nd he might have also..... now frequency of fun with my frnd cum rm mate is reduced very much... but when ever we do it.. we enjoy it.... what ever it is... plzzz let me know , what i m....??? soon i will confess one more part of my life... but after solution this one..... thnxx admin for posting me.</p>
<h1>Viv- Well for one thing I don't know why is it so hard for people to remain loyal to their partners. Either stick to the guy or stick to your GF(which should be your priority). And dear man, you are a bisexual. You can have fun both sides but don't you feel bad when you cheat on your girlfriend, who is perhaps sticking out for you? Moreover, if by any means your playing is discovered, then you will prove the assumption about gay community that gays always look for sex and there is no loyalty among them.</h1>
