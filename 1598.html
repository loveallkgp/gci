<p>You guys may not like my confession its not an exct confession but i just wanna share something i just discovered of myself..
Well i mark 20"live in india since my 9 grade i always loved and fell great about my parents love towards me..i get what i want..goes wherever i want..and do things that i desire.. I even got my first car when i was just 8..m thankfull..But last december i found out myslf that i ws adopted.. I was an original mexican...with all those guilt feelings within i was on for walk (19 dec.2013) i saw a men he was just young yap he was handsome ..lol. He was alone nd u knw he was kinda boring and some tension was within his mind..so i sat near him and ask him whats wrong ..upto my suprise he told me evrithng (thou i was just a stranger )about his tension.. so i decided to share my problem too.. We becme gud frnz..we were both straight but i dont know we had sex ..we often kiss and now we are dating ..he is more perfect then i could ever imagine. He got no family..his parents died on a car accident..he got a bro who take drugs so this is the reason why he was being rejected by all the girls..so i told my parents and now he is with me living in my house .. But i have a question.. Am i doing the right  things.???? Being gay is not a crime i knw that but since its my first time i fell kinda reluctant to take my further step.....and i fell so unlucky and even fell shy to step infront of people after i discovered that i was adopted..am i lucky guys.. :,(</p>
<p>$ABBY :being adopted doesn't change anything . think if they didn't adopted you you might be living in orphanage or maybe in streets .parenting means caring , feeding , giving good education , giving somebody shelter , love and affection .and you got everything as u mentioned . </p>
<p>and you said you are straight ( but i won't stereotype ) but as you have fell in love for a man who also consider himself straight ...  it might be called a relationship made out of sympathy .</p>
