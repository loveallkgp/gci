<p>hey guys
i am 20 roorkee
i m doing my btech 2nd year,i m in love with my friend,but he is not gay.one day unexpectedly we supposed to sleep in one bed.then i couldnt resist he being with me under one blanket.so,i seduced him and he also liked me doing all crazy stuff.we then had loads of fun after that incident,he has been a lovely friend to me.i loved him alot,that i could do whatever he asked me to do.but suddenly one day when i went to his room ,he said that "dont u fucking care to enter my room ", i got hurt .and now he stopped talking to me.he is avoiding me.he is treating me as if i have done everything wrong to him.he is not even talking to me.i dont know what to do.still i love him so much.he dont give a fuck to my feelings.oh my god its hell thinking about him,and the days we spent together and now nothing is same .everything is gone.he doesnt even wants to see me.</p>
<h1>Viv- He treats you like shit and you are still in love with him? Well, here is a thing for you.. why don't you confront him and say, "dude, you were equally involved in all of it..so do not put your effing shit on me.." and then change your room. Don't see him after that.</h1>
