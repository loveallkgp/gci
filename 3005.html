<h1>GCI- Gee, why don't guys like you are in abundance? What a positive human being you are! Though your confession was a bit on the negative side but I am refreshed! Living doesn't necessarily means taking your kin forward. The minute you let that thought out of your head, you will be able to concentrate more on better things. Now, your parents seem to be quite understanding. They are disappointed because you tell them that you won't be married and they have a thing in mind that you will live alone. No parents want their kid to live alone after they are gone. You have to tell them how you would be happy and whom you would have as your life partner. I am pretty much sure that your parents will stand by you. Don't just give up one dream. Make a million more.</h1>
