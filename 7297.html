<p>Hello friends,
Its not a confession but need suggestions.  Completed ma study n now earning well, so i feels its tym of life where I need someone who can b with me for rest of my life. Before also I was too attached with one of my friend met through FB, but now v r not together. I tried many times to get someone but every time I compares them with my x and then things goes wrong. I don't know y I got people who all r just interested in only one thing. Tired now in waiting of Mr. Perfect. So I want to know from you guys is there anyother way to get someone of same interest instead of FB , PR and Grinder. Is there any matrimonial site in India that can help ?? Thank you.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm...5 things for u!</h1>
<p>1- We all have benchmarks. With every new person create a new one..do NOT follow the old ones.</p>
<p>2- Never compare ruby with emerald, u will end up losing both.</p>
<p>3- There is no Mr. perfect in life...WAKE UP KID.....be the so called mr. perfect and life will stop giving u lemons.</p>
<p>4- STOP being an over-expecting bitch, that will screw ur life forever.</p>
<p>5- If u think that u can be with someone in this country then start to develop a ''don't give a damn'' attitude, have a very sensible maturity where u can stand for urself with or without someone.</p>
<p>P.S- Do not try to be a snob, instead build an empire with someone who will tick ur heart with the ryt touch, but do not forget to work on urself at all the levels beforehand too!</p>
<p>Goodluck!</p>
