<p>F 14
I was 13 when I realized that I wasn't straight. There were many girls who actually helped me in realizing that I was into girls. Then one day I saw a girl and she was magically beautiful. She had something special that I couldn't got my eyes off her. I also realized that I had never felt this way for any boy. I am pretty much a lesbian (It takes time to figure out the true sexual orientation, I might confirm it in the future.)</p>
<p>Being not straight is literally a struggle in India, most of all you can't tell anyone because most of them are ignorant. The family to which I belong isn't actually open minded so yes, The Gay word doesn't even exist in their life! For them marriage is not even about love, it's about "To fit in society" so forget about same gender marriage, you can't even think about opposite gender love marriage! One day they will surely be horrified when I will come out to them. Talking about friends, I am still confused that I should call them friends. I mean they are my friends now but once I tell them about my sexual orientation, they will start avoiding me, specially girls. I once played a prank on my female friend that I am a lesbian and she was like "don't touch me! Bitch you stay away ewwww" . But I was like "Bitch please, I have a standard. I don't hit on dumb girls"</p>
<p>I am tomboyish too and never got bullied but there was always a fear of getting bullied, and still there is. But a part of me says "Come out to everyone, it's not a thing to hide. Just love yourself" and other part says "Don't tell anybody, they'll make fun of you".</p>
<p>But I am less worried about this and more loving myself today is because of one guy and that's my elder brother. I came out to him (And started crying, I never used to cry.) He accepted it without a shock and told me that it's perfectly normal. He also said that there was nothing to hide but people are foolish and Bhais ke a aage been bajake kya fayda. He loves me and has been the biggest support of my life! Then I Also came out to my elder cousin sister and her reaction was same. Then I also came out to another cousin sister but her reaction was homophobic at first but eventually understood. (wise and sensible people).
Now my secret was known to these few people who taught me to love myself and accept it.</p>
<p>May be after realizing it, I have started avoiding people.
I like staying alone. Have reduced the no. of friends.
Hate social gathering and PARTIES.
I am still going with that phase of suicidal thoughts but we all need to fight and survive.
One day I will no more be hiding my sexual preference but today I am not ready but that one day will surely come.
Literally afraid of "What if someone found out that I am gay" And dying to tell everybody that how beautiful it is to be gay.</p>
<p>Because I have tasted the rainbow and I am never gonna be monochrome again! :')</p>

<h1>GCI- Damn! You made my night! Yes its midnight here.</h1>
<p>You have a lot to see and a lot to experience in the world in coming years. Just keep on loving yourself and do not back off when something hits you hard. There is always a family away from our original family. That's how we queer people survive in the hard circumstances. So don't shun people away, you might need them in future. :)</p>
