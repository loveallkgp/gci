<p>related to confession #2621</p>
<p>those who commented on my confession that i shouldn't shout on my mom whenever she starts irritating marriage talk, i must tell you that there is a limit of endurance, i can't endure that irritating discussion on marriage talk because it had been going on and on for a long time, at firstly i politely told my mom to change the subject but she didn't consider my opinion, to stop her perseverance i had no option except shouting, i llike to start my day with a newspaper, not with a irritating conversation which is expecting a impossible event in future, if you were in my shoes , you would've realised how irritating everything was!  </p>
<h1>GCI : see you mother is mature and you are mature . why don't you got and talk to her and tell that ' mother please don't talk to me about marriage yet or ever mention it . when i am ready i will talk myself .just don't talk about my marriage infront of me '</h1>
<p>and one thing you shall try to learn your mom's mentality too. she is a lady who has a grown up guy . when she sit in her own age women , where all of them are talking about their married sons and married daughters or engaged daughters or sons or their grand kids ... it might makes her want to feel the same feeling and talk about her family . so let her do what she does .. if it makes her happy . </p>
<p>can't you just have fun with your mom . i mean i always joke around and make my mother smile when my marriage is mentioned .</p>
