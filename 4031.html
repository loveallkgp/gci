<p>This is the first time that i am writing on this page at midnight and that too on midnight of Diwali....don't know what overtook me....but i felt the urge to write at this stroke of the hour..On this day the real meaning of family is known..but the underpinnings of a family and our unflinching attachment gives rise to some utilitarian aspects which are used against all different orientation people and is put as sacrilegious as well as salacious...(lustful)....what we all desire is some support and understanding from our parents..but mostly we get suppression as well as indifference...the episode of 'Satyameva Jayate' did exemplify explicitly our community and i saw parents of adults spreading the message of true meaning of family..but i felt the episode to be incomplete in terms of SEXUALITY strictly speaking..nevertheless it was an applauded endeavour....and the missing BISEXUAL part doesn't make sense if we can understand as to why there was no open bisexual..there was no need of it at all !!!!..coming back to the parents part i felt was that an utopia which i saw on that episode or is this the way families must function???...however i saw some parents accepting the fact that their child is gay in my real life and some just plainly ignoring and blaming aamir for his STUPID ,UNNECESSARY theme..here we can say EDUCATION must be the tool of enlightenment but mind you those who are sitting with their back against the LIGHT shall not see it..no matter how hard they try....and for us to make them understand we must know ourselves first..if we cant generate our identity from our understanding nothing is really going to change...because our family wants our best but that doesnt mean they have turned GOD ..they are our physical gods and not our spiritual gods..that means we should treat them as humans first and mother father later on..it sounds very difficult but once put in practice it will bear fruits...even ROME WAS NOT built in a day....we all are equal as souls..but as humans we are made to believe in INEQUALITY and maintain the status quo..and this is where we are made to breed and fed on hypocrisy and occlude our thinking process which gives rise to onerous duties of life as a son ..a husband and a father later on and vice-versa.....but here LGBT people face ineluctable series of events which are responsible for no long term gay relationships and even the dour base of crimes..my questions therefore are 1- Is there a way to stop feeding on perpetual hypocrisy??/2- How much are we responsible for our misery?? 3- What are the areas that need a complete overhaul in terms of our understanding and pseudo intellect of the society?? 4- How to combat familial blackmail and to stay firm regarding our sexuality??? 5- What are the things that need our attention before we make ourselves strong and after we come out to establish ourselves as EQUALS in our fucking double standard era to put an egalitarian view of ourselves too???</p>
