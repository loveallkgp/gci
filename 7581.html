<p>Well it's been long after the story of my love was published..DIGNITY.... He is happily married now...I danced in his wedding till my shoes were literally fall apart....we are still friends and the best part is that he loves to help me out in every possible way. I am glad that he never ditched me and being a straight he never made fuse or made fun out of me even after knowing my sexuality and love for him. He was content and always stood by his word that he is straight and loves me the way a brother does for other.
Now I have another lover... I met him in Delhi, my old institute, and know what? He heard my name from our faculty and he was eagerly waiting for my presentation. I often visit my old institute to give career related presentation for my juniors. It was not a love at first site, although he is smart,intellectual, and very good looking fella. He connected me through my real fb account after a good long year and started chatting with me. I ignored him initially thinking he is too one of the freshers who are always longing for a good guide to start a easy career. one fine day and he just asked me wether he can visit me as there was long weekend lying ahead and he has nothing special to do. Lonely me had no option but to happily agree. He stayed for a week with me and he turned out to be a simpleton and an ideally generous guy, I started liking him. Well needed a shoulder to lean upon. But the biggest dilemma was He was straight and my junior from the same Institude, from the same filed where I have earned right amount of respect all over the India. But to my surprise he just asked me whether he can shift in with me so that he can learn about our filed in detail. I said nothing for a while but after giving a long and deep thought I said yes.. Well it did take long 4 months to take the final decision but worth it. Left everything in Delhi and Came to stay with me, job, gym, friend etc. he is kind of guy who loves gymming, talking for hours, reading and quite adventurous, to my surprise he share common hobbies. Like gymming, swimming and fishing .. So we started spending lots of time together. He love sleeping hugging me tight, make quite Funny faces, and he is blessed with killing smile and idiot knows it well. Slowly started falling deeply in love with him, he too started liking me, I guess because there were hints, he was never easy to be left alone in my free time. sala Chipka rehta hai. out of blue he suddenly asked me wether I am in relation with any girl? and poor me had no guts to lie but indulge the truth . One fine Sunday he randomly slept beside and started talking bullshits...straight talk, I pretended as I am interested but certainly I was not. After a few moments I asked him to go away and let me sleep for a while, he said nothing but rolled his arm all around my head, looked at my eyes for about a minut and suddenly kissed ( just a pad) on my lips and said" I started liking you, but I know it's wrong but Bhai Tum bahut achche Ho"... My love story started taking wing from that point , it's been 6 month now...
but recently I came to know that He hide lot of stuffs from me and it was all spilled by his brother when I was in his hometown for 7 long day. He wanted me meet to his family... I was taken aback by their hospitality and simplicity. They knew about me more than anyone else ... And the fact was they were meeting me for the first time. My love spread everything positive about me... I was overwhelmed by their love. But the moment I realised what his past was and present is, I started shawing a very nasty side of mine. It's been week we are back in town. I asked him not to return to me, instead to continue with his life which he is trying to hide but he was not ready to ...he said " sale office Jane ke liye tujhe Kuan jagayega?" And packed his bag and came with me. The situation also dint allow me to creat any scene as I deeply care about him and the family which gave me the respect and love. It is an accident happened yesterday. 11 in the night after coming Back from gym. I asked him to clear each and everything and asked him to leave me alone and go back to Delhi. He has a girl friend who is not ready to leave him at any cost, he told me this for the 1st time, he still talks to her but never initiate from his side, the call comes from other end. He explained everything and said" Mein tujhe dukhi nahi dekhna chahata tha,past ko bhulna chahata Hun aur present ko Sambhalna chahata Hun, Mein bahut Paresan Hun, tum samaj nahi paoge ", I said nothing, felt really bad, I know I am the culprit, asked him to leave but the what he said totally left me falling in love with him again, he said " Tu chahata hai toh chala jaunga lekin marunga yahi ake tere pass,"...I think i am really loving this moment.
Now tell me Guys should I remain with him? a love story of so called straight and gay guy is possible? Tell me guys... I am totally confused...I trust him but still don't want to spoil his lovely life. He sees a wonderful life with me ahead. He dreams for it I know. Because he had tears in his eye when he was talking to me yesterday. I have seen love in his eyes.</p>
<p>His past was gf, and I thought they are not together anymore and they still are...but as I told you he never calls her but she does..he wants to get away from her but she is not ready and warned him of her life. I acted nasty as he told me nothing about this. He never had sex with anyone as he claims and was a Virgin when we met.. As he is Muslim and the gf too from the same community and of very young age so sex was never possible. His brother told me he wants to get away from the mess and they had a talk about this.</p>
<p>About marriage, he does not want to do so. Ask me   To do the same since he wants to spend rest of his life.
For gay part, he has no idea about gay life and has no friend
He loves kissing my lips</p>
<h1>GCI- Have you ever had a conversation about homosexuality ever? Maybe he doesn't understand the phenomenon, and when people do not understand the science, the reality and the history behind it, they often make mistakes. Mistakes so bad, they sometimes many lives are left ruined.</h1>
<p>Try to talk about what is there between the two of you. Is it just a fling or you have something serious. If it is something serious, do you both have the guts to stick to it or not? If not, then there is no use of investing so much into something that will not be profitable in the long run.</p>
