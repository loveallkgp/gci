<p>yesterday my boyfriend kissed me for first time. from the past three months (since the beginning) our relationship was in worst state. He continously ignored me and I did the same. He told me he wanted to meet me so I met him at CCD.  he didn't say anything so I told him that our relationship is not working. It's time to leave each other and he agreed. Outside the cafe, he told me that he wanted to drop me near to mtro station. As we were walking, I didn't realise but we had already entered in an isolated and dim-ly lighted street. He then held my hand and pushed me to wall and kissed me. He took mine lips into his. Then he held my face and kissed me deeper. He held me tightly, neither could I protest nor could I stop him. His deepnkiss weakened me, he kept on kissing me and finally in the end, he told me that he loves me too much and he won't let me go. Finally, I abondoned my ego and confessed that I too love him a lot. we kissed for some time. 
when I reached home, he had already sent me messages that he can't stop missing me. He can't live without me. Today , I again met him, he held my hand and we went to his house and spent some time together, he kissed me a lot. Around 50 times in one hour. he didn't stop and I wanted him to do more.</p>
