<p>hi.. i am in a relation with a guy.. we both love each other n everything's good..
But there's a problem.. whenever we are making out(i m a bottom), i dont get a hard on.. even if i do, it doesnt last long... though i m extremely turned on by him n i love him a lot.. he feels that he doesnt turn me or or that i dont love him to the extent he loves me... though it';s not true... i love him a lot.. i just dont know why i dont get a hard on while getting fucked! earlier also when i used to make out with other guys, i never got a hard on.. but before that when i was with girls... there was no problem.. i fucked them hard n satisfied them to the fullest.. is it a sign that i must not move forward with this gay relationship n go back to my previous straight life??? or should i try topping with my bf??? but he's a top..i m nit sure whether it will work out or not..plz help</p>
<h1>GCI- So you have had sex with girls in the past and now you have a bf. Its more of a mental problem rather than a physical issue. You have to leave all the insecurities and then proceed further. Maybe you don't have a fixed mind for it from within.</h1>
