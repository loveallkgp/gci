<p>Hello GCI, I'm here again after a long gap. I feel like I've done a terrible mistake and wanted to confess to someone. I've been in love with my best friend for 5yrs now. Hez also so affectionate with me and loves me a lot as a friend. Friday nyt we are so drunk and slept in our room. I've taken a little extra may be I totally lost control and in the middle of the night I started kissing him and licking him all over the body, he got a big boner and I sucked it till hez out.. I thought hez totally asleep and thought he didn't notice what I ws doing, a minute later I stripped his shorts and clicked his nude pics with my fone. Then he woke up switched on lights and told me to delete those pics. He looked so shocked and angry, he said he valued me so much and that I shocked him with this behaviour. he said he didn't stop me before coz he thought we'll forget all this in the mng but clicking pics is too much. Then I told him that I'm sorry and I wasn't under control. I confessed that I secretly fancied him since the Time we met and I explained about my sexuality. He left the room and the nxt day he txtd me that we shd forget everything what happened that night and we can be back to usual but he didn't want to respond in any way about my sexuality and my love to him, he told me not to raise that topic again between us. I said ok, but he stopped being so close to me like before, he doesn't hold me on my bike or sleep beside me now. But he talks and does things with me like nothing ever happened. I understand he responded in the way he thinks most decent but I'm dying with this guilty feeling and the feeling that I can't hug him or even hold him anymore. I miss my friend I shouldn't have drunk that much..</p>
