<p>Hey #GCI, I am a new reader of this page and I find it interesting, how you (admin) try to give advice for situations, so for this a big thanks from my side. As usual I got something to share here, so that you and friends can suggest me what I should do with my current situation. So here it goes...
I came back to my city after five years. I was looking for a sophisticated and sensible guy for fun. I am generally free before I join my graduate school, so I thought to explore this world and made a fake fb profile. I am amaze to see that most of the people here asking for sex directly, I don't know why this is like that. I always knew that I was gay and I love my skin, but i never tried to found sex over cyber. Although I was in a one sided relationship for a long time. When we broke up I found out that I was the one who thought it was more than sex, he wasn't in the relationship. Although we didn't have any bottom lines, when we started this thing. Whatever,after a long time I was chatting a guy over few weeks, we talked about everything and we finally decided to meet. He is really great and I like him. We met and everything was fine, but  something happen few days ago and i don't know why I call him at midnight and told him that I like him a lot. I was drunk and I just blew it off. I am really sorry for it and I don't know how to fix it. We may have end up in a good terms but i didn't handle the situation properly. I understand that i was too fast to express myself, just after one date but is there any way to fix this so that i can start it from the beginning. </p>
<h1>GCI- Just call him and explain him the stuff and then apologize. Next time you meet him, be mature and don't drink. It makes you do terrible things. Terrible-Things. <em>remembers past and shudders</em></h1>
