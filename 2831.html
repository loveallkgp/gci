<p>Are gays and lesbians napusak ling as defined in ancient scriptures or does napusak mean a bisexual. Bisexuals are half male half female? Why do bisexuals beg in a train. I feel sorry for them. Every one on this page calls bisexual a cheater. What is the cause of people being born bisexuals or gays is it because of a sin or is it a psychological disorder </p>
<h1>GCI- Ugh.. let the lecture begin. Gay and lesbians have fully functional genitals because they are males and females respectively. Human infertility is irrespective of the sexual orientation. Now those who can't reproduce are the eunuchs or hermaphrodites who are gender neutral and they fall in one of the many categories of an umbrella term called "Transgender". Eunuchs are castrated males and hermaphrodites, in the common and disrespectful term are called as shemales(not to be used). They beg because they were not given equal status by the government of india until recently. There were no job options for them earlier but now the scenario is changing.</h1>
<p>Bisexuals are those who are attracted to both male and female sexes. And its not because of being bi that they cheat. Many people irrespective of their sexual orientation cheat in their relationship.</p>
<p>Lastly, being born as a bi or gay is not a sin or a mental disorder or any other blabbity-fucking-bleh. Its as normal as being a heterosexual.</p>
