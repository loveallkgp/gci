<p>hi,
Why is it so hard to be who you are? Why can't everyone let you to be who you are? It is so damn frustrating. I knew there was something different about me since I was a kid. I never acknowledged my attraction towards guys till I was in college. 
I was/am the ideal son that every parent wants. Good grades, no drugs, no fooling around with girls, no complaints of any misdemeanor from anyone. So I was liked by most people and my parents were very proud of that. 
I wanted to come out to my family and was looking forward for an opportunity to do it. My parents are very traditional. They are also open minded about a lot of things. So I was very confused if coming out is a good idea. But I have kept my sexuality a secret long enough and wasn't able to contain it anymore. It's like trying to control a volcano from erupting or trying to contain an ocean in a bottle. Literally not possible and so are human emotions.
My father was watching the news and news about Gay Pride Parade were on. He switched the channel but most channels were covering it so he had not choice but either to watch it or turn it off. He kept watching. I found my opportunity and started talking about the Gays. He listened may be absent minded and kept nodding his head. I blurted out the words, " Dad, I am Gay". This caught his attention and he asked me again. I repeated myself. He walked out of the room. I started crying. He talked to my mom and my mom came in. I was crying and on seeing her my crying got louder. She never saw me like that. So she hugged me and said it is okay. I kept saying sorry and she said there is nothing to be sorry about. My dad left before I could explain him anything. He started avoiding me and my mom told me to give him some time. It's a big shock for him and is very hard for him understand it. After a week, my dad asked me to get ready. I asked why? Where are we going? And he answered don't ask questions.  He took me to a psychiatrist. He talked to me alone and then to my dad alone. My dad didn't said a word on our way back. The doctor told me that it is okay to be gay but he asked me one thing, how can I be sure that I am guy if I never have been with a girl? I am known for my witty humors even in the worst situations. I turned the tables and asked him if he  is straight? He said yes. Then I asked the same question to him that how can he be sure if he's never been with a guy? He smiled and pretty much got the answer he was looking for. He gave me advice to stay the same regarding the attitude. 
My dad is still not on good terms with me. He does understands that it's not my fault to be this way. But he can get his head around having a gay son. I tried committing suicide 3 times and every time I failed. Bad luck may be but am not going to waste this life just to get his approval. 
My cousins and many relatives also are homophones and they make fun of me every chance they can get. After my graduation, I moved to Delhi. I talk to my mom and no one else. If I am dead to them then they are also dead to me. Family is there to help you no matter what. I don't need a family that loves me when I do what they ask and hate me when I don't. 
I am happy to be with my bf. But I have to go through a lot to get here. I wish there was no bigotry and hypocrisy regarding this. 
Do you think I should talk to my dad? I really miss him. He was always there for me when I needed him except this one time. He hasn't beaten me up, cursed me or offered any treatment whatsoever. What should I do?</p>
