<p>Hello friends.
R we really friends ?
Do u know that when baby boy in foetus, his testis are in abdomen UpTo 7thmonth.  From 7th month, they start to move from abdomen to scrotum. This process is happen with each boy baby before birth. . . But unfortunately its not happen with 1-2% in world called as " undescended testicles",  those people r unlucky.</p>
<p>And unfortunately I m from one of those unlucky. Undescended testicles hv only one option to move testicles from abdomen to scrotum By surgery UpTo 1 year age of baby. After 1 year of age, their is risk of cancer for undescended testicles even after they moved to scrotum By surgery.
I m 16 year old , before some day suddenly paining started in my abdomen. After diagnosis doctor told to remove both testicles.
Testicles are important body part, other than sperm creation they does Harmon creation, puberty, burds, men body muscle chest. 
Without testicles person will become like No Body, no energy
Do u know Why testicles are outside of body in scrotum? Because they require low temperature than body otherwise they will pain n swollen, can't grow.
If I remove testicles , their is no life for me. What should I do?? I can't share my problem to any one bcoz it's shameful.</p>
<h1>GCIL- There there love....don't panic and be sure of having a safe surgery and yes the points which u stated here are true about testicles and their functioning and formation at pre-natal stage.</h1>
<p>Be sure of one thing that life is possible in many ways..with testicles and without testicles....when u will understand this then u may come to tell us about ur journey again on the page.</p>
<p>Love and hugs from our side.</p>
