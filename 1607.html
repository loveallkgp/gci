<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    hey everyone
    its not a confession but its something which has happened with me twice. once it happened in my graduation time and now its happening again.
    i am 23 years old engineering graduate and it all started in my 3 year 2011 (during jan-feb). there was one guy (i cnt disclose his name here) u can call him rahul for now. i somehow got this vibe for the very first semester that he is gay but i never got intersted in hum and we both had different groups in college. we only interacted during labs or tutorials . i must tell u we both were super involved in extracurricular e\activities where we organised various annual cultural festivals. it all started from there only and yea he was after one cute girl though bitch and u can call her avantika in 2010 sept-oct rahul gets chance to organize technical festival for our collge and he recommended me to assist him to our teachers. everythng was goin fine untill he said &quot; yaar meri ladai ho gai avantika se&quot; i said &quot;why , kya hua&quot; . he said &quot;usne mere love bites dekh liye&quot; meine kaha &quot; kisne diye, avantika ne&quot; kahta &quot; nai, usne diye hote to vo gussa kyu hoti&quot; . i siad&quot; mujhe bhi dekhne hai&quot; usne kaha &quot; haa dekh liyo, neeche chal ke dikhata hu&quot; after we went downsatirs he actually showed me his love bited on his chest which he got from his &quot;durr ki sister&quot; (he said he doent care about dur ki sister as he is Punjabi by nature) in one the weddings he attended recently.
    then i said &quot; koi ni , go and kiss her or whatever she will be ok&quot; . after that incident we became good friends and we go hell lot of adult talks which is usall part of guys personality. but after some time i fall for him and i decided to send him friend request from my fake gay account, an i did. surprisingly he accpted and messaged me &quot; who is this? do i know u? &quot; i said &quot; no i dont, i was browsing various profiles and i got urs and i thought ur cute so i send frn request to u...do u mind talking to a guy&quot; . next day he replied &quot; i dnt have nay problem in talking to guys and yar ur profile is vary horny so i cnt add u here. tell me who ur and i will give you surprise&quot; . i was shocked...i said &quot;what surprise?....i knew tht u like guys . do u like to sleep with guys. r u top or bttm&quot; ??? i was so into him i cant wait to have sex with him but he took almost 2 days to reply &quot; bro who said ia m gay, and why did u sent me frn request this cant be funny&quot; then i said so many things to make him realize tht i am not fake and i am seriously like him. i asked&quot; r u top or bottom&quot;. he said&quot; i am versatile and he did had orals with his colony frnds&quot; i was shocked literally bcz what i was thinking was totally write. then he said he would like to be fucked by me and he actaually invited me to his house bcz he parents were off to shimla ot manali that time. he acatllu said&quot; yaar meri gaand kab marega&quot;
    then i thought if he gay an di should tell him the truth about myself.....nad i did....and oppsote to what i thought he flipped 180 degrees and siad &quot; saaale tuuuu......mein to bakchodi kr rha tha...mein t straight hu saale,....mein to dekhna chata tha tu kon hai...&quot; FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKK I WAS soooo pisssed off....but i fell in love with him during that session and continued till 2012 may be till now.......after that we had so many horny conversations and so many arguments which i cant write here...actually i want to write but i am vet bad at writing....wish i can record all those things and posted here.....
    i felt cheated, rejected and somehow lonely during that time....i actually cried so many time while listing any romantic song( total stupid i was) but i never had any kinda anger in him ...whyyy???
    i want to beat him and tell hum dude ur gay juss accept it and have sex with me....u cant deny it.......i felt less in fornt of him

    i am not good with words but i think you all can understand wht i wanted to express here.....i juss wanted to tell me am i overreacting or he is PIG??? whatever he did to me was justified???
</pre></div>


<h1>Viv- Another case in denial. People are comfortable with strangers but not with the ones they know. I mean how is that really justified? And yes you were stupid for falling for him. And really how could fall in love with someone over a conversation? Does real time meeting and knowing each other count for nothing? Tell me one thing though, you said you want to beat him and have want to have sex with him. Are you sad because you couldn't get a piece of him? Clarify yourself whether it is love or what?</h1>
<p>PS- His distant girl cousin is definitely a guy. Also, if the history is repeating itself you should exercise your experience and stay the hell away from this bullshit.</p>
