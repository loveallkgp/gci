<p>i dont know if u will reply me, but i want to ask this because an another guy asked me!! and I want a really snappy reply...plzzzzz</p>
<p>okay, I m open to a few of my friends and another guy I know here is also, I dont know, maybe gay (i think he is confused himself ) okay here is wat he said wen I said gays cant be happy wen they marry a girl --- " No marrying is a must every man should marry a girl.. but after marriage he had to stop having gay relation... We should enjoy gay relation till getting married , then after marriage start loving their wife and act normal to avoid problem. "</p>
<p>I asked " how can I love a girl ?"</p>
<p>he teased me for that telling that " stop being emotional and just marry a girl, life is a complete problem anyway... Act as if u do !! Just ogle hot boys, if they come by and tats it.. , because we shouldnt cheat her "</p>
<p>I totally disagreed to that nonsense.</p>
<p>I mean y is he like this ? and he is a doctor !! Dont post this crap admin!! I know he is stupid... But I want a snappy reply to tell him plzzz....</p>
<h1>GCI- Lift your head up and say to him, "Come to me when you will loose control over your emotions. I will say told ya on your face and enjoy the burn that you will have. Tsssssss."</h1>
