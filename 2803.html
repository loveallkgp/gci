<p>I stay in hostel with a friend,the very first day i saw him i fell in love with him! i was very hungry for him! i always thought of expressing my feelings for him but couldn't due to his childish attitude,i had a fear that he might tell my other friends if i told him what i felt! So,i used to touch him and feel the pleasure! it was a night,at around 11pm he was in deep sleep and i had got up from bed to go pee,i saw him sleeping in his white baniyan,that instantly turned me on! he was sleeping side-ways on his bed...it had a little more space left,i slowly slept beside him,and put my hands on him...i removed my pants and started rubbing my dick over his ass...and that's it! he felt the thing at his asshole and got up quickly and found me naked sleeping beside him!! he kicked me off his bed and started dialing my other friends,as it was already 11:30 almost everyone was asleep! i begged him not to tell anyone about this,he hit me,shouted at me and cursed me! i was literally in tears! Then i somehow convinced him not to reveal this matter,then the next day he changed room! Now he is not talking to me at all...no body knows this,but still im feeling for him! i don't know but still i want him! i can't control myself! </p>
<h1>GCI- Better to control your activities and your feelings for him or you will go through even worse. There is something called playing smart for your better future. Now if you want your college life to go smoothly you will put your pants back on and keep your feelings inside them hidden.</h1>
