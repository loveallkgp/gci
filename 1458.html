<p>confessor #1441 here
Let me explain myself a bit. I was born a female but I never felt like one. Everything about my body was WRONG. I thought of myself as a boy while growing up. At the same time, I didnt like girls, but was only attracted to guys. I first came across gay porn when I was 11 and that was the exact moment I realized that I am actually a gay man in the body of a girl. I am 22 right now and am slowly transitioning to male. I have had top surgery (removal of breasts) and will start taking testosterone soon. I am short and thin and a fairly cute looking twink ;)
I didnt mean any offense to bisexual guy! What I meant is that the one kind of men who want a relationship with me are creepy straight men (who call themselves "bi" to get into my pants) and basically treat me like the girl I AM NOT. I want a partner who treats me like a guy and genuinely loves me for who I am. I may lack a dick but I pass off as male otherwise pretty well (with a bonus hole, of course :D )</p>
<p>$ABBY : i know i got you and ididn't said you being judgemental about any type of person . to be frank i think you shall give time a time untill you totally convert into a man . otherwise people gonna keep on treating you like  a woman . people judge by outer looks . finding love isn't easy ... its written and happens only when right time comes . </p>
<p>and don't let anybody use you for sex ... first keep them hanged in a relationship for atleast 1 or 2 year befor making any physical relation with them  . best of luck from our side :D</p>
