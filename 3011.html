<p>I come with a sad story of my life. I knew I was gay since I was 8 years old. Of Course I didn't know the term but I knew I was in boys. I lost my mother when I was 5 to cancer and my father raised me. Since I was the only child my father and I used to live alone. He was a drunk and many times he used to beat me up. One day I was going through the stuff of my mom like clothes, photographs and I saw dad was standing beside me. I looked in his eyes and they were red maybe because he was drunk. Suddenly he put his hands on me and started pressing my body. He threw me on his bed tore open my clothes and fucked me the whole night. I was crying and begging him to stop but he never did. It became a routine for him. Till the time I grew to be 14 he used to rape me. I had this hatred inside of me growing for him because of what he made me. A soul less sex slave. I never confessed it to anyone in my immediate family. I even tried to suicide because my life was literally becoming hell by his presence. He did provide for me but I had to pay for it. After that it all stopped because one day he suddenly died in an accident while coming home. I went numb and feeling less human.</p>
<p>My mom's sister was the one who really loved me and after that incident she adopted me. They had one girl but still they looked after me. They loved me like I was their own son. Meanwhile I concentrated hard on my studies and got into a very nice university. It was my third year that I got a boy in my very class and we started dating. We went into a relationship and it was amazing. I was happy that my life took a turn away from what I suffered. Later I got placed in a company with a good salary package. Right now I am working in Australia with my boyfriend doing his masters in the same city as I am. All I want is the acceptance of my masi for who I am. Life gets better indeed.</p>
<p>Message to everyone out here- Don't ever give up in your life. You say that your life was never good enough then look at those who have so much trouble to face just to eat 2 meals in a day. Your troubles will look like they don't even exist. You only have one life, make it worth living.</p>
<h1>GCi- Damn! You really got my heart beating fast. I am so sorry that you had to go through child abuse and that too from your father. you are like an inspiration of falling and then started walking with your head held high. You really got an awesome life ahead of you. God bless you with every happiness buddy!</h1>
