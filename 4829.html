<p>2014 had not been that good .... first 6 months were ok ok kind and last 6 months changed my life completely . No matter what it had been like . My past had made me a better man in my personal life . We always blame our luck and fortune for our miseries ... but the time we start accepting our present and start working to improve our future . I swear nothing can beat us down ... I have made a hell of mistakes in my past and now it's a new year a , new life .to work and improve my self. .. I don't wanna hate or write shit about those who had made me feel bad and hurt and had left me alone when I needed the most . But I wanna thank them for hurting me , and leaving me alone and I thank them for making me feel bad . Because their criticisms and these heart breaks had definitely hurt me .but it had also thought me a lesson and made me a better human being ... thank god 2014 is over .... the worst year of my life ... I thank u all ...for ur criticisms because all ur hard bitter words had made me a better human soul .... load of love ... from Dev singh ...</p>
