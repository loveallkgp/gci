<p>Dear friends, i dont know if this will even get posted .. but i just feel like writing this... We all, atleast most of us do believe in God! Do you think God can make mistakes?? A real believer will say 'No' .. Obvious reasons are: He is GOD and He is not an ordinary human like me and you to make mistakes! I have read many posts saying ' I am born gay '. Well if u have seen the movie pk i say its a 'wrong number' in our head ! It keeps ringing to the same number evrytime we think about it.. Guys we are not dumb bunnies .. We are not some default pieces created by God.. when a person says ' i am born gay' it definitely make a person sound like a default piece( I hope i didnt hurt anyone saying that) .so as i was saying we are not default pieces and let no one ring this wrong number in your head.God made Man and woman.. thats all and he did it perfectly.. he didnt create any default pieces! And he cannot because he is perfect.. You must be thinking .. if this guy is talking too much against what i think is right.. why is he even posting on this page or have an accout like this.. ??! Well your answer is .. stop evading what i said.. your mind is very blant that you just want to revolt rather than thinking about what i said.. and who am i?? I am also and ordinary person who is struggling with my best ability to come out of this disease.. which you people think it is not.. but i want you to think about it.. i was sexually abused when i was a kid and later on it just became a fun factor in my life .. which never got out of me.. but when you realise that there is a greater power that loves you so much .. you just want to keep trying even if you fall.. And in that very love im standing now and telling my dear friend who are reading this.. ! I have posted here before telling that this group is a very nice one.. yeah sure it is.. but then the whole base must change.. rather than compelling a person to accept being gay.. give that person help rather to come out of it.. i see that the admins have a great nack of convincing people.. maybe you can use it for helping them .. i know this wont get posted cus it might not be following the protocol.. but i hope the admins read this and think about it.. maybe someone can be helped. Start loving God and you will be directed in the right path.. but be humble enough.. dont go with a proud heart thinking what can he do.. but real life experience he can do miracles! God bless you! Thank you for reading i know i am a bad writer but hope it helped atleast one of you! </p>
