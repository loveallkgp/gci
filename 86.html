<p>24 mumbai (sorry its a bit long bt dil se kikha hai.) It was summer afternoon. My roommate came wit a new guy (his fren from computer class). I didn't gav much much attention although he was a bit sweet looking and muscular guy. Later that evening this new guy came again and my roomie introduced me to this guy. They were planning for lonavala the next day. Group of college friends along with this guy we went to lonavala and had loads of fun. This guy apparently started visiting us and since we guys frequently had house party we invited this guy quiet often. Mere se zyaada he banni lagi thi iski.... fir feelings toh aani he thi. Mujhe ye ye banda aur zyaada he accha lagne laga tha.... Cute sa toh tha he.. Ab ye mere sapno main v aane laga. Whenever we met... Felt very happy... kaafi miss karta tha usse And depression waali v feelings aane lagti thi kavi kavi Coz wo doosri cheezon main busy ho jaata and can't meet him for weeks.. (i had went crazy for him pyaar ho gaya tha us se). Main God ko.kaafi maanta hu... Maine kaafi pray kari... " I dnt know wats going on in my life God help me I need this person in my life" fir days went on... We became best of friends... Shared everything. He called me everytime whenever he had sum plans and vice versa, Went for movies, bar, night out. Did crazy things... After getting drunk sumtimes kavi maine usse samhala kavi usne mujhe kavi kavi after getting high, he kissed me maine v kia. We slept together.. (not sex). He got his job. Bt fir v hafte main ek baar milte zaroor hai. For me he is nicest person in my life now. This deewali while we were partying he told me, " bhai ye 4th year hai I'm celebrating deewali with you." it was Wow moment for me. </p>
<p>Hamara 4 saal kaisa guzra pata he nahi chala. While in trouble he cared for me, maine v kia. Maximum shopping maine uske saath. Maximum movies ussi ke saath. Maximum outing ussi ke saath. Altogether my prayer was answered. He has completed his education and now living wit his family in Mumbai itself. This is last semester of my postgraduation course. maybe Soon i've to leave Mumbai for job and all. But.. I have had my share of love  . will always cherish these moments and zindagi kaafi lambi hai will always be best of friends. will love him forever.</p>
