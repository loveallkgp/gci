<p>i can't understand why bottoms (probably tops too) get this feeling of being a sexual slave, like getting beaten and raped, i once met a friend who was a bottom too and he told me that he wishes that a handsome cop would come and rape him, he (cop) will beat him with a stick and then he will rape him, then i interviewed some other bottoms too , one person said that he wants edward cullen (robert pattinson) comes and does sex with him so passionately which breaks that bed and his whole body get bruised and every other's bottoms thoughts had some similar elements, i think sex should not be painful but enjoyable , just giving pleasure to each other...</p>
<h1>GCI- That is a generalized view. Infact I know some guy who prefer being passive and they are quite dominating! Yes sex should be enjoyable and that happens only when you have a right partner irrespective of being in a relationship or a one hook up. But at the end some people find pleasure through pain while some do through passion and love. Personal choice.</h1>
