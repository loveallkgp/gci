<p>This is regarding  confession 5926 and  many other posts lined up regarding family pressure of marriage and then the  admins reply that recent Priya Vedi story should be a lesson for all of them. But do you really think it will stop the pressure from family? from society? All we can do is blame the society rules and their denial to accept homosexuality. Homosexuality is banned in many countries today. We all are hoping for a change but it has a long way to go.It needs everyone's support but will everyone support? NOOOO !! And why? Cause again no one wants to come out of the closet.It will never be easy for millions of people with their families around or for any other reason. So I don't think that staying away from marriage is going to help people(NOT ALL PEOPLE as some are better off alone). I am sorry admin but I don't think that you read the story fully. The girl had accepted her husband even after knowing the truth cause she LOVED him.She even wrote that on her letter. It was the repeated torture he did,repeated criticizing of her family and dowry demands which led her to suicide.I am not saying the husband did good by hiding it from her. The point I am trying to make is it would have been a successful marriage if the guy was gentle and loving enough. Not all gay marriages fail, not all wives with impotent straight husbands leave them. Sometimes love is more important to people than  sex. And I know the gay-straight marriage won't stop happening either cause everyone will want to cover up. So I urge every married gay person to be very humble ,caring,loving to their wives. Love and respect them so much that they never regret to have married you. For the ones under family pressure, it really depends from person to person and family to family and your surroundings. Look up what's easy for you(Only for the people who can imagine themselves with girls and are being forced into it) and what's really going to make you happy.Sleep with a slut ,see your potentials before accepting marriage proposals. All I know is no relationship will end disastrously if their is genuine care,respect and love between them. A wife well loved won't go out and tell people about her husband's impotency and him being bisexual. Sometimes these people are infact able to have a successful coitus with their wives This post is for 70% of gays who coverup(according to stats),but I don't think it's a really good idea to blame them for lying and stuff cause at many places in India it's impossible to stay single as  they don't have any other option. Being alone would lead them to depression and many a times coming out of the closet also lead to unfortunate brutal events.So be happy be loving. To the 30% of open gays ,you are doing a great job and maybe cause of you people the 70:30 ratio will come down someday. And to the admins of this page , I am really grateful for this page,it's a boon to our society.</p>
