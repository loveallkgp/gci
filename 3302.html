<p>Before confession , let me clear that m a hetrosexual guy with a gf .I am 21 n half yrs old .Recently, my elder brother got engaged . i was really happy as i love my gf a lot and thought after his marriage i will tell my parents abt her . but then , one week after the engagement , he came to me and said he is not happy and he didnt wanna get married and told me that he is gay. I was stunned. I felt like slapping him. But he busted into tears and said that he is already married to his boyfriend and that he want my help to let everybody(family) know abt this. He told me about his boyfriend and i know this guy as his(my brother's) best friend. They studied in same school,graduated from same college. He confessed they r in relationship since 7 years . i got scared. I thought my bro is mentally ill and thats y he is gay. I then decided to explore Gayism. Watched video involving gay men in love , gay porns and a lot of article as to y people r gay. And i got my answer that i was wrong . i came to know its not illness.Thru facebook , i came across this page. Read Almost 1500 confessions here and then again my perception towards Gayism changed . out of 1500 i found 1300 confession abt sex sex and sex .Meanwhile , i saw my brother crying on phn while talking to someone (his bf , i guess ) . his love for that guy is immense ..Now i am really confused . His marriage is in december. And i feel thats the best for. He is 26 , settled and i feel its the right age to get married. But he says he will run away before marriage and that scares shit out of me.Kehta hai suicide kr lega but shadi nahi karega. He says they both love each other like hell. My mind has stopped working guys .i want to see him married to a girl .itne sapne dekhe h hum sab ne .My moms like , 9 lakha haar pehnungi iski shaadi me .maine socha tha ye pehnunga iski shadi me , ye dance karunga .but my all khusi , all excitement gone now ..All these 26 years, he never ever gave us any chance to suspect him as Gay.That Guy (his bf) used to come to our house since they were in higher secondary . he used to stay in our house for whole night and vice versa . But i never thought that way.. And he suddenly comes up after his engagement abt his gayness. I dont know what to guys. I dont know mai kiska side lu. Wo shadi nahi krna chahta , aise me shadi kar b liya to i m damn sure this marriage wont last long. Mai apni studies thik se nahi kr paa raha hu.Dinbhar dimag me yahi ghumta rehta hai. I just cant imagine how two males can fall in love with each other. Kabhi kabhi to lagta hai wo impotent hai isliye gay hai. But i know impotency has nothing to with gaynes. I am sorry , but i didnt mean to offend u guys . I respect everyone here.But dimag kuch b sochta rehta hai .M following this page and few others since july and reading articles on net to know more n understand abt gayism but still i cant understand n imagine two men loving each other. His marriage is in december. And i dont know what to do.</p>
<p>Kya apne parents ko bta du ?? Ya phir Bhabhi ko bata du so that she can withdraw from marriage. Or i m thinking to take my brother to a psychiatrics .i just dont know what to do. Can somebody tell me how to convenience him for marriage.Somebody pls help. I dont want him my bro and his bastard bf to b together anymore.</p>
<p>And one advice to u guys too .. Stop it all my brothers . Hetrosexual relationships r beautiful. Feel the beauty abt girls. It feels awesome to b in love with a girl. All i have found through ur page is gayness is just abt sex.Rise above Lust. Maybe , ur parents will accept u.har bar , bar chiz ko accept karte hi hai wo,just coz they r u parents .but think abt the pain they wud have till their last breath. All parents wants their son to get married to a gal and have kids and have a happy life.</p>
<p>And i apologize if i have offended any one of u here. I dont have any ill feeling for u all. Infact , i wud love to have admins of this page as my friends.I wud have sent a frnd request to some of the guys (wud not.name them) if ur profile wud hv been CLEAN, but nhi kr skta kyu ki meri gf mere profile ki har ek chiz baht kareeb se check karti hai and all u guys here ,members n admins r beautiful. Just rise above gayness and Lust. God bless u all. Sorry if something is offensive here.</p>
<h1>GCI- See buddy, you have too many wrong notions about homosexuality. You might have read many things but from the inside you haven't accepted the very idea of it. It is indeed a shock for you to digest this early and I don't blame you for it. It will take time and slowly and slowly you will be comfortable with the idea.</h1>
<p>Now coming to your brother and his case. You say that your family has too many expectations. Tum ye kapde pehnoge uski shaadi mein aur tumhari maa 9 lakha haar pehnegi. Aur bhi kaafi kuch soch rakha hai, haina? Par kabhi ye socha hai ki usse kaisa feel hota hoga? He might have been putting up his brave face in all of this but I know how he must have been feeling inside. he is broken. We always talk about supporting family but when it comes to gay son asking acceptance, suddenly he is targeted as selfish. Why? When you can't be understandable why put the blame on him? He is born that way and he cannot change his life just for the pressure from the society and the small mindedness of people which has kept the whole world in the dark. Getting him married to the girl will only trouble him even more. The life of the girl will be destroyed because he won't love her at all. The life of your brother will be destroyed. And god forbid if anything happens, the happiness of your entire family and his bf will be destroyed. </p>
<p>Love can happen between anybody. It is not bound between heteros. Two guys can indeed love and there have been examples of gay couples having a happy life throughout the world. You have to be more acceptable towards the idea of two men falling in love. If you can't doesn't mean nobody can. For me, the idea of heterosexual love is weird. </p>
<p>Now don't term heterosexuality as the lusty affair. Rapes happen in hetero society, there are redlight areas having prostitutes where men visit, hetero people do extra marital affairs, hetero people also do friends with benefits things etc etc. There is page on fb called "adult confessions india". Now if I read confessions on it should I think that heterosexuality is all about lust? You read some confessions and your attention was more on lusty ones so you came up with a conclusion that being gay is only about having sex with a guy. It is not always so. Straights are not saint either.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say that if you really love your brother, you should support him. A 7 year long relation is something that should be treasured by the family. All we need in this present world of hate is love. Nothing will cure him as he doesn't have the disease. Its you who has to accept him and trust be it is the right thing to do because its not a selfish thing from his side. It is a human thing. Hope I have cleared your thoughts.</p>
<p>PS- Confessor, you don't know what type of emotional turmoil gay people go through their entire life. The realization of being different. Then comes the realization of the society stigma, the fear, the heartbreaks, the bad experiences which a person cannot discuss with anyone, the acceptance. A gay person go through so much at his entire walk of life. Do increase your boundaries and know more. We did post the stuff regarding this also. You might have skipped it. But nevertheless you have to read about it also. </p>
<p>PPS- Read the link in the comments.</p>
