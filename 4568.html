<p>I just want to share how it feels to be in LGBT community, specifically in India. I'm an engineering aspirant residing in G.noida.</p>
<p>In short, It doesn't feel good to be different in such orthodox society. Where being yourself is a crime. Freedom is just an illusion here.</p>
<p>Gay word is used in bullying here, like its an abuse. I have to constantly hide my sexuality and pretend that I'm straight, Which is big deal.
I hail from a small village of UP. I've known my sexuality when I was in 12th. I never discussed it with anyone. Though having sex with boys or fucking boys is an act in which many guys are involved in India. But loving them is a different case here.
That's what I happen to do. I used to fall for boys.</p>
<p>There are three things which matters when you're diferent:
1. Your loved ones. In india people dont even know homosexuality exists so telling them you're homosexual is beyond imagination.
2. Law. Which criminalize the homosexuals in India.
3. Society. Of india? enough said.
So, you can imagine how does a homosexual feel here.</p>
<p>Now, I'm in an engg college, pretty fucked up with all the gay dating and relationship stuff, dreaming of moving out of India who denies to accept me. Life sucks for us...!!</p>
