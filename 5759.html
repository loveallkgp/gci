<p>Hi everyone god bless ull this is vishal from Mumbai 19 a girlish type typical gay . I am proud to be a gay no issue what people think on it i work inane a bpo coz of some financial probs let it be lets come to the topic last week since the financial year ended everyone knows work is nil for atlas 10th days of April so v jus have fun talks singing sleeping etc.. Last week i cameout by my truth as a gay by my two colleague friends by both i shared my life sorrows 1st's reaction was its k n being a str8 guy he started thinking deeply on it n he said uske apne gf ki bat pe gaur kaye bina baat karta raha where as the 2nd one said such people like u no need in society ye uske fake words the i guess it by his jestures bt when some tears rolled down my eyes listening it he was uncomfortable n he apologized me for his words so i think coming or to this world is not that difficult is it ri8?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well honey just come out when u are comfortable and accepting to urself first...and coming out is not a big deal....the only parameter is that ur security, peace of mind and ur integrity must not get harmed by any moron or a shit pit!</h1>
<p>Rest our page members will elaborate it for u!</p>
