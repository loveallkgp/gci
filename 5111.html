<p>i don't want to start my married life on the basis of lies.. please help </p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, you cheating is not the only thing that is complicated between the two of you. How can he be straight if he says that he loves you? And honestly, you do know the reason why you were committing mistake. Everyone knows that. Don't try to be innocent here. You both have to come clean out of the closets to each other here.</h1>
