<p>Hellus.
I've been having a good tough time in this relationship. It's the longest I've ever been committed (just completed a year). I see so many couples who've been together for far longer and they're inseparable. I wanna lose my virginity to him but he won't go all the way. I find myself taking all the initiative in texting, making plans and almost everything else. I've been through clinical depression, and intimacy and companionship are what I need right now. But I can't leave coz I love my guy to bits. Whatever small time we've spent together this past year, it has been such a happy blur. And I'm bright and sprightly like a kid for days after. Is it bad that I'm relying too much on the physical presence and other physicality of the relationship than resting assured that the guy is with me?
He also has another person he loves, and that upsets me too, even though I would never confess this face to face</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe not on the physicality of the relation, you are relying too much on the expectations. He is not the one standing on those expectations. It sounds like you are doing all the work to keep it together and he doesn't even feel like the same as you do for this relationship. And he has another person that he loves? Have you two actually talked about it? Relationships are not the master-slave condition. You both are equal so behave like one!</h1>
