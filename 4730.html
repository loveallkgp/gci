<p>There's a guy in our institute in 11th class ........ I saw him many times ....... He is effeminate ........ And he is infact proud of it ! .........but damn people ......... Here the environment is so homophobic that even the teachers do crack homophobic jokes ! ...........and so ..... I saw this guy surrounded by a "mob" in the campus during the breaktime ...... He was weeping .......... Coz the guys were making fun of his dress .... Hairstyle ! About who he is ! ........ They were abusing him ! Saying really bad words ...... And the girls ......... I never thought girls cud be so homophobic ! ...... They were smiling and laughing at those jokes and comments !</p>
<p>Its not only dis much ! ........... I am very sure that there are more than a thousand in our campus going through the same struggles ! Daily !</p>

<h1>GCI- If you want to have some positive environment in the place where you are studying and you want to take a stand about it, then go to the head, tell him all the condition and ask him/her to have a group where a bunch of people can work for awareness inside the school premises. It is a good effort that you are doing and a courageous one also. Keep it up.</h1>
