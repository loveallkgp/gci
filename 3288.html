<p>I am following this page since last few months and observed majority of confessions came here contains pain, sorrow and negativity Although Kudos to Admin, who is blessed with a rare trait "Sarcasm" This is not confession,but i would like to share it with you all- Yes i am a gay man in late twenties. Beside all myths keep coming, i never been raped or molested, my sexuality was completely my choice. I enjoy playing cricket and hate window shopping like most of the guys of my age. I am in a relationship from last 4 years, we do have differences but our love is far bigger than those fights we usually take up. I took the time in coming out, and finally told my family , friends and co-workers last year. And to my surprise most of the reactions were better thn i expected. Feeling Blessed </p>
<h1>GCI- Ahhhhhhhh-mazing! God bless you honey! :)</h1>
