<p>"I am gay."
"Hey, I am gay and I am proud of it."
"I am a proud gay."
"Being gay is awesome."

But, alas, this acceptance by me of what I am is not helping me at all. I may shout aloud the fact of me being gay, and pretend to be cool and happy with it, or claim that I want to live as I am, with my head held high. But, do I have the courage to do the same in reality rather than this virtual world. Do I take a stand on issues which relates to the LGBT's against the odds. The answer which I get from inside is a clear "NO". This is what the reality is.
I ask my God, to imbibe courage into me to overcome these. I want to live a 'real' me. Real in reality. I want to be gay and proud.

"I am a gay, and proud of it."
"Being gay is being you."

<h1>GCI- Not everyone has the courage to be a fighter or to take the stand, and that's okay. If you want to do something then work for it. Don't feel bad about not taking a stand as of now. But at the same time, don't give others a message that they can say whatever homophobic stuff that they can. My stand taking came in me when I started arguing with that homophobe Harit Kumar on facebook.</h1>
