<h1>Viv- Feeling guilty? You guys are done! Its over! Curtains! Poof! May be he's still stuck on you thats why hes feeling jealous. Step into his shoes for a moment. How would you feel if he tells you the size of his butthole after his numerous sex dates? Would you feel jealous? If yes, you are also stuck on him. If not, you must not feel guilty in the scenario you described. Tell him its your life and his j-factor must not affect you.</h1>
