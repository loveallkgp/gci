<p>LOVE WHO U LOVE be it gay or straight!!its all the same at the ends.true love always hurt!!</p>
<p>FYI:for the GCI ADMIN.your nagativity towards about a gay loving straight is a lil undigestible though you are definitely great in others aspect.maybe u lack experience in this regards.TRUE LOVE CAN CONQURE EVERYTHING ITS JUST NEED PATIENCE AND OFCOURSE A REAL LOVE!!!!</p>
<p>gays dreamt of marriage to there lovers that hinders when it comes to mingling with straight.as for me being with someone whom we love matter the most. marriage is not the ultimate ends!! Love that binds is what matter most.</p>
<p>LOVING A STRAIGHT GUY AND RECIEVING LOVE BY THEM IS DEFINITELY POSSIBLE!!!ONCE GETTING THERE LOVE IT REMAINS DEEP DOWN INTO THERE HEART THOUGH MARRIED TO A GIRL THEY STILL LOVE US THAT MEANS A WHOLE MORE LOTS!!</p>
<p>MARRIAGE IS NOT THE ULTIMATE ENDS STAGE OF LOVE!!</p>
<p>GAY LOVE OR STRAIGHT LOVE ITS ALL MORE OR LESS THE SAME.
Its all personal choices and I hate the fact that you discourage and feeds with negativity when confessing love towards straight.</p>
<p>HOPE U KNOW NOW TRUE LOVE CAN CONQUERED EVERYTHING AND NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IF ONE KEEP ON BELIVING AND TRYING!!!</p>
<h1>gci- Its all very good to read when you said it all. But you have to be practical in life in times like there. If you think that being in love with a straight is okay then people also think that being in love with someone who is in a relationship is okay. Its true that you don't have a control over your feelings but you should also know that which situation will lead you where. True love can conquer everything, yes but not at the cost of your happiness. Sacrifice isn't an answer everytime, is it?</h1>
