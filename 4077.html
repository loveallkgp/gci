<p>You're walking on the street and suddenly catch a damn pretty and amazingly cute guy looking at you while coming towards you from the opposite direction. You're like 'Man, He's Hot'.
He looks at you n then on the ground. He again looks at you and then somewhere else and then again at you with a nervous expression masking his face, and then again away. You know right then that the dude's into you.
And there you are on inside jumping like a 14 year old girl and shouting inside of you 'Yes! Yes Hottie m gay as well....don't be scared...I just appear straight but m totally, totally gay! You so can approach me'. and woooshhh...the boy passes by you and all you could do was walk away as well like 'Damn!'
You just want to go back and grab him, kiss him there and embrace as tightly as you could coz you soo know he wants it too! but you r mad at him as well for not approaching you...
but right then you think 'even the story from his side might be the SAME! who knows? ;)
You just walk away with a faint smile on my face remembering what just happened in 4 seconds n thinking about the fate of we gays in this society. <em>sigh</em> never mind. but the boy was too cute...n being gay (definitely) made him cuter. Gay guys r pretty btw, no? :D</p>
