<p>Hii.
In school days, I got to know that I'm gay. I would get uncomfortable with guys (who r presumably straights)-my classmates because of my being gay. Sometimes also because I would be asked questions whose only justified answer is : Bcoz I'm gay.
So, slowly slowly I made myself alienated from them. I had no friendships.</p>
<p>Now I'm in 4th year of my college. I live in a boy's hostel. And the same thing continued here.</p>
<p>In first year, I was questioned so heavily about love life, friends, interests,  sex life etc. That I got withdrawn again.</p>
<p>Since I'm uncomfortable with guys therefore it's not possible for me to be relaxed when I'm in a group of boys, or if I talk to a bunch of semi-nude boys in my hostel or when 5 guys are there on 2 beds etc.</p>
<p>Lots of people want to talk to me and befriend me. But I get nervous and feel uncomfortable after a while. And since I live in a boy's hostel I slightly fear also that someday something unfortunate could happen. That's why I avoid interactions with people. And it has always been the case.</p>
<p>I never made good friends and avoided to make any. I avoid people before they are so comfortable to ask me about my love/sex life.</p>
<p>Because of all this, my life has become very loenly. There are times when I don't talk to even a single person from day to evening. </p>
<p>Being a closeted guy in a boy's hostel is preventing me from making friends.</p>
<p>Even people ask me, why don't you come and get along with us? Why don't you sit and talk with us?</p>
<p>And some feel I'm arrogant too.</p>
<p>Judging doesn't hurt as much as my loneliness does. </p>
<h1>GCI- There is no one to whom you could be yourself? Don't look for romance right now. You need a platonic friendship with someone who knows your reality and is okay with it. You need to be okay with yourself and you need to learn to not give a damn. It took me a long while to reach there.</h1>
