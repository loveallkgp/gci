<p>My parents still love me the same even after knowing that I'm gay. I have a younger brother who is such a bringer of joy to me. He is like my baby. Most of my straight friends know that I'm gay but they are cool with that. Still there's an emptiness in my life which seems to last forever. I still see dreams about getting someone special in my life. I want to marry him and be with him till my last breath. But I have given up on love. Most of the gay people in my city, kolkata, indulge in mindless fornication. I've been the meal to few of them. They made promises, showed me dreams, then had a taste of my body and dumped me like a garbage. Sometimes I feel so frustrated. As I'm good-looking, I get lots of offers. But they dump me once they are done. Is it really that hard to love someone truly without treating him as a meal to quench your carnal desire ?</p>
<h1>GCI- Sometimes you just have to stop expecting and start living your life and start loving yourself first. You can't love another person if you can't love yourself.</h1>
