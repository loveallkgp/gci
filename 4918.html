<p>Heyyy everyone :)
M 17
i was a confused guy few months back...i knew i was attracted towards boys more but i took it in brotherly way...but later on i came to know about this fake world...fir i made a fake id...slowly i began to know my interests and about my orientation...i am a regular reader of this page ...i read this page to get deeper understanding of love..emotions...and other issues
...so finally i ended up as bisexual which i am happy to accept ...but moreover i m gay and yeah now i am happy about it...actually i feel very special...i researched a lot about sexuality and now i can freely explain people what i am
although i m closeted but i have told about my boyfriend to my chotku bhai who is also my bestest friend who is 1 year younger to me
and i feel so relaxed
.
i wanna thank this page for helping me know more about myself...giving me the courage to accept myself...and loving myself even more...i also got my soulmate whom i will marry...
.
i know we talk about acceptance but once u accept yourself u will find some way for people to accept u...n yeah logo ka kam hai kehna :D i m gonna smash their face...be bold...be proud..be brave...be successful...those who love u will always b with u :D
i have not opened up but still i beleive that everyone who loves me will b with me ... i know they are narrow minded but its because they are unaware and ignorant about alternate sexuality...simple..i don't blame them...the homophobes should be blamed
.
admin i na i m superfan of u guys...soon this page will have 10000 likes ^<em>^ its like party time honey
and yeah after my board exams i m going to start awareness in my city about sexuality conduct seminars in schools and colleges...i m so yoing and if i can do it u all must also create awareness to make things positive
.
god has gifted me with talent of being a good orator...although confession thik se ni type kia coz m sleepy now....to i request u all create awareness...even the institute were i study everyone respects lgbt coz of my work
.
abhi jol ki ninni aa rai ab kisi or din confess karunga
:D stay blessed stay happy
we are all so special :* mhhuuuaaa to me n my hubby ^</em>^
.
plz spread awareness</p>
<h1>GCI- That's one great initiative from your side! Glad that we were of help! :) Have a good life ahead, boo!</h1>
