because i dont want to die all alone in my life</p>
<h1>GCI- Who says that you have to die and then have to reborn to have the new energy? You are suffering through this because you are being too much vary of your actions and your behavior in the public. Also, you have not accepted yourself. Its all okay buddy. Don't let other's judgments take you down. The fault is not in you. It is in others that they judge everyone around them. We all judge as humans but some of them just cross the line.</h1>
