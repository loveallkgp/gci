<h2>so here is my story plz post it before next year.</h2>
<p>Hey,Salam,Namastay
Here i am to share the story of my life. This is not an erotic confession let me clear this.
Life begins when a son is born to a semi rich family already abundant with daughters. It was a ray of hope that he will inherit the family name onto his generations and will keep them alive ages after ages.
After the seventh day of birth according to religious aspect is a better time to name the baby. So i was named ___ aka Waleed.
"Such a cute baby bro ", said one of sister.
In the past their elder brother had died so this boy was a silver lining for them.</p>
<p>Loved by everyone i was sent to school. It was a lovely thing to be with lovely friends.
I was bred in a village, every weekend we ,cousins, used to go to the fields and farm. I being the youngest was taken special care. We used to bath there.
One day after when returning to home , i remembered my toy cars are left in the canal bed. I couldnt resisit to forget them. My cousins told me it is a time to leave and we wont come along. i said it was ok. I rushed back and picked them up</p>
<p>When i was on my way near an orange field. The keeper we used to call him "Maali". He asked me what happened. He inquired if others have left. Then he asked me to come and eat some fresh oranges. I agreed because he was offering for free and i was feeling hungry. He plucked a few oranges, peeled them. He said the ground is wet. Come sit over my lap. I affirmed and went over to him. He adjusted himself and placed myself in sitting position. by the time he was giving me oranges, i felt something hard underneath. I didnt pay much attention but he was placing it here and there and smiling . I also smiled in response. After a couple of minutes he let me go.
I was only 6!!!</p>
<p>When i reached home i told my older cousin that he grasped me tightly and i felt something was wrong .He said Men do that when they meet and it is fine.</p>
<p>I had 3 cousins, one named ahmed, waqas and hamza.
Waqas and Hamza were brothers.
One day we were searching the house to find some movies to watch, suddenly we found a movie in which a girl was undressing. My cousin laughed and said, "watch everybody. Such a whore. **** yeah"
I asked what is this all about?
Waqas said you will find it when you grow up.
I suspiciously thought about it all the time either it was school or home or anywhere.
Now i guess it was untimely and i regrett it (sad feeling)</p>
<p>3 years passed and i used to listen my young classmates gossiping about love making etc and i used to say "Gandi baatain" or "Foul Discourse"</p>
<p>So they started calling me "Shareef bacha" or a Naive kid.
Even in class they opened their fly and popped out peeing organ to measure it (phewwww)
I turned my eyes but at the last bench.
(sex education is considered bad but the people dont know how the consequences of getting such education from bad guys would result into)</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, sex is like literally everywhere in India and I can't even begin to understand that why it is a taboo thing. People say that talking about sex and all is not our culture and any movie with sexual content is protested against. Even people who kiss openly are frowned upon. It's just a kiss. And then people say, "You guys are making kissing on the streets okay, next thing we know you people will have sex on streets." Umm, no one is that foolish. Sex is comfortable when done on bed and not on streets.</h1>
<p>Anyway, sex education is really required in our country not only to have awareness about sex related issued but also about self protection. I don't think that it can have a bad effect. If anything, it would make the generation smarter and more open about it.</p>
