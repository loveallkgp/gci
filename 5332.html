<p>Hi all beautiful people,
I just finished watching the latest episode of Glee ( an American teen musical comedy series). I felt overwhelmed at seeing them get married.( Don't want to add any spoiler just in case anyone is following it). I want to get married to a guy but the right guy has never shown up at my doorstep. It so lonely and frustrating tbh at this stage of life ( I am almost 32). All the good ones are either straight or engaged and who cares to be with a promiscuous bitch. In the due course of life, I have met so many guys, but no one was the Mr. Right. I am still waiting and the peak years of beauty and awesomeness are gone. I am not able to figure out what am I doing wrong? What is missing? I couldn't find an answer. May be you guys can help. Or maybe my expectations are too high. I don't know. I want honesty, reliability, loyalty, emotional bonding and upfront. All I find are sex starved slaves.
I want to give guys an advice to go for the right man if you are lucky enough to find one. If not, keep trying and have realistic expectations.
Thanks</p>
