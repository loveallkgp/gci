<p>Around 1.5 year ago I meet guy..
Soon He became a important part of
my life.. Actually he becum my life.. We were roommates and live like
(Friends with benefit) for 9 months and then we separated due to ur colg
was over..
I fell in love with him but soon he gt move on from me..
He
starts ingnoring me and some other silly things due to whc I suffer a
lot.... Waise b he left me alone nd uper se ignorance. I cried I lot nd
face many other prblm....
But some how I manage things and make everything normal..
Now everything is normal between us.. And we are planning to shift together again some Whr..
But I hv a doudt as we both are straight acting guy.. ( we both r bi and hv interest in girls also)
If
I again shift with him.. He definatly leave me after 2 - 3 years means
we gt seprated again.. As he don't want to knw any1 abut ur relation..
According to him its shameful...
Nd he don't want to hurt his parents also...
Now
I confused what to do?? I don't want to face the same situation again.
Bt I love him I don't want to miss a chance to stay with him.. No matter
for how long..!!!
Oohh.. God its complicated.. </p>
<h1>GCI- Then why are you taking the step if you already know the consequences. I really wonder how can people objectify themselves when they expect respect and equal status from others. Where is your self respect? If you want to make it just friends with benefits, then let it be like that. Just fuck and forget.</h1>
