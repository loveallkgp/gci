<p>Have observed that too many people have turned vitriolic towards the learned defence counsel in the Nirbhaya case for his misogynistic remarks. One must understand that he was a deface counsel as every lawyer is bound by duty and obliged by the virtue of his profession to think, speak and act in the best interest of his client. It would be absurd and undesirable to chasten an advocate for what he says in defence of his client even if he says something otherwise unacceptable.
My second area of concern is that governments are disproportionately inflicting prejudice on men under the pretext of women's safety, welfare and rights. This is something that works at cross purposes with gender equality and promotes the ideas of female supremacy. Most Indian women in the 21st century is highly delusional individuals who think all men are waiting and wanting to ravish them. There have been a large number of rape cases with weak prosecutions that stem from misdirected malice and male fide intentions. Although one is innocent until proven guilty in the eyes of law, society bears a presumption of guilt against the accused and ruins his entire life. The sexual offences laws in most common law jurisdictions fail to offer enough protection to men who are victims of sexual abuse perpetrated by women.</p>
