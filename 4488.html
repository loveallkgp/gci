<p>This is my first time making any confession, but I really need to get this out of my heart.</p>
<p>I am 19, gay, college student and totally comfortable with my sexuality. I was in a long, fulfilling relationship with another boy since my high school days. I broke up with him when I realised that we really did not have a lot of chemistry with each other and now that we were grown up, we should explore what we really wanted in life.</p>
<p>After that, I did try dating a few guys in my city, but somehow I could not connect with anyone romantically. I know I am completely over my ex boyfriend. It is just that whenever I meet guys, I cannot imagine myself being in a relationship. I am not asexual. But somehow, a-romantic (if that's a word). It wasn't a problem to me till now. I had accepted the fact that it was hard (if not impossible) for me to fall in love or be romantic to someone. So I stopped dating altogether. I was happy the way things were going. I was happy to be alone and independent too.</p>
<p>But I have few gay friends who are so optimistic about love and life and talk about relationships in such passionate way that it makes me wonder if I am loosing out a lot in my life.</p>
<p>This is very confusing. On one hand, I know that I do not want a physical/romantic relationship with anyone. On the other, a part of me wonders what life would be now to be in a committed romantic relationship, to feel helplessly drawn to another person - something I have never felt in life. </p>
<h1>GCI- Don't force yourself in a relationship if you don't want to be in one. It will not be good for you and the guy you will be with. If you want a break then have it! Go for it when ever you get the inner feeling to be with someone.</h1>
