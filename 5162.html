<p>Hello Admin, I had come out to my brother - he says I couldn't be gay, in fact he believes that I'm not.
After which I've been told by him that, because I associate with such people, I chose to become one. What are the good ways to prove your sexuality to someone who doesn't believe..? I was told that I need a doctor n I'm mentally ill.. Felt bad for awhile, gotten over it.. Pl tell me whatta do</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, don't pay attention to him. His words should not define you at all. You know what you are, you considered him worthy of telling and you did. Next step is upon him to accept you. Moreover give him some time to digest the fact as for many Indians this is a whole new concept. If he still doesn't accept you, then honestly, don't put too much effort in it.</h1>
