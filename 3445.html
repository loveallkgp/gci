<p>I am 36, gay single and virgin. I have never met any gay guy in person. Its mainly bcoz im very shy and get scared of meeting people. I get panic attacks in large groups. Cud be bcoz i was bullied or maybe my strict parents. I dont know whats wrong. I tried talking to a doctor and priest and all they said was im lucky i never had gay sex. I shud get married and all my fear will go away. But i cudnt just risk spoiling some girls life. Some say I look good and am funny and caring. Some Guys and girls stare at me in my office and one guy keeps trying to get close. But i avoid them as i dont find the courage. There might be noone like me in the world. I feel so ashamed that while chatting i lie that i have had sex. Some complain that being gay is tough..try living my life.</p>
<h1>GCI- Seriously not even a blowjob? Honey, you got to take a leap of faith some day. You have to live the life. You just can't sit back and cower everyday in your bed. You have to get out of the shell. Date someone and get into a relationship and forget the past of strict parents and the priests.</h1>
