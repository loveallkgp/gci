<p>It's a fact that I was dumped many times reason being refusing to dish sex.do I regret that? not even a bit! I never will comprise my dignity to keep any monkey in the zoo! I don't get down with kids or people who aren't men enough! you think you'll speak with your little finger in the air then top me? squeezing ur voice like celine Dion then top me? walk like naomi Campbell then top me? too many words like Isha mashauzi then top me? snap out of that wet dream n get dry to go home. You must be a man enough for this man to bend it like Beckham for you! hahahaha if u don't like what I say you just have to keep the silence since Facebook never provided a place for dislike.It's only comment n like!</p>
<h1>GCI : me as a person will never say 'sex seekers ' are bad . if somebody is seeking sex and they are true onto your face about what they want then there is nothing wrong with 'demanding what you want'/. ( only if they aren't tricking you into having sex ).</h1>
<p>secondly dear please stay in peace . how can somebody dump you when you ask them clearly what they want and tell them clearly what you want ? 
if somebody says they want relation and next day they ask you for sex , just leave them . when you are true person , you sump the people not ' people dump you' .</p>
<p>its not that i am defending somebody or taking sides .. i am just putting the facts right . why do you connect with such people. and if you are dating or meeting through any dating site like PR the my suggestion would be leave it and try to start connecting through fb with people . just when you are sure about the needs of person then only meet them . and still keep a ' 6 month' test . don't sleep with anybody withing six months after you start dating somebody .</p>
