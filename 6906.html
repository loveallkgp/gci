<p>Hi Admin &amp; to all who read my share story ,actually am from PHILIPPINES &amp; pure FILIPINO :D I'm 23y/o friendly and cool guy , 3yrs ago i've been experienced relationship with my same sex, He is my friend of mine i never expect he would admit to me that he is a bisexual i never shocked coz i felt that way already, he is genius, nice and most heartthrob to the campus coz he is good looking guy, we become more closed to each other &amp; everyday we updated of what we do &amp; what i do ,one day he ask me to come with him in one event so, i go &amp; it's been 2am was done the event, he said i'm goin to sleep w/ him coz so very dangerous at that moment if i go home,and while i'm lying in his bed he suddenly kissed to my lips when i open my eyes he say i love you, i cant imagine i never refused him in that moment &amp; you know what happen next &amp; then he say he loved me but 1 week later his gone,he going to the other city for work,he blocked me in his fb &amp; no communication, why he say i love you to me but his gone??i cant forget my friend.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well our phillipino friend do consider the facts of bisexuality first, then the social position of gays in your country. The amount of sincerity of a guy depends on what kind of mental baggage he carries and then act accordingly because there are many people in our life who will say these three beautiful words but only a handful of them will actually mean it!</h1>
<p>P.S- Your friend may have been confused about himself or about relationship or simply phobic to commitments and might not had included u in any way in his future plans, its that plain honey!</p>
