<h1>GCI- First of all, your friend did a big mistake while having a two relations at the same time. And now his ex is posing a problem for him which is a nice lesson for your friend for messing up. But as the family thing is involved, your friend can also tell him that the ex's family will be informed about his orientation as well so both of them can reach an agreement to stay away from each other. Talking between them is out of the question I guess.</h1>
