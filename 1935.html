<p>Not a confession just general.
I see so many people complaining about there penis size. Let me tell you something, my first time with my bf is very bad. His asset was very big when i first saw, it was like a big anaconda coming towards me and since it was my first time i started crying because i could not bear the excruciating pain and started bleeding. Since then im really scared to have sex with him but still we both are going strong without sex for more than 1 year. Seriously i prefer sizes between 5 or 6 inch. Something beyond that is very difficult to control for any bottom. So if there is any top who have small penis, be happy sometimes we like small things also ;)</p>
<h1>19 #del</h1>
<h1>GCI- That reminds me of a shakira's song</h1>
<p>Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible
But you gotta know small things also count
You better put your feet on the ground</p>
<p>Seems legit.</p>
