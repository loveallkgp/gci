<p>Here is a guy from delhi university.. problem is i'm a gay in closet and one of the junior girl has crush on me.. First it spread as a rumour i thought it is hoax but then one day she confronted me in the lawn and confessed her love/lust. I didnt answer anything.. And i thought ignoring her would make her to forget me so i didn't talk to her and cut off all the means of communication but me n her but little did I know about the seriousness of her feelings and to my surprise even after ignoring her in every possible way for atleast a year now she still hasn't changed abit.. Everyday she sees me she cries and people come to me making me realise how badly she wants me. But what the hell i'm gonna tell them. I pull up useless excuse to evade it but day by day no. Of her sympathizers are increasing and collectively torture me. I'm so trapped in a maze what should I do..</p>
<p>P.S. I can't admit my queerty infront of her or anybody else. So give me some cool suggestions..</p>
<h1>Viv-She needs a reality check to not be brokenhearted princess thingy. Or if you really want to say something to her then say that your parents had already decided a girl for you ever since you were 5. And you really can't disappoint your parents.</h1>
