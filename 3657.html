<p>Hi all,
Good to find this page here where we could vent out our feelings openly.
I m 32 yrs married business man. I m bi sexual. I fell in love with one of my male employees. He is 26 yrs unmarried and handsome. His physique is almost same as mine. He is straight as he has a GF from my staff only. Also could not get into sex with him due to social establishment. So i found a way! I slowly slowly made him a close friend. Now we are very close friends. Best friends of each other actually. I also help him to date his GF. I also took him to a prostitute so that i could see him nude. ...! We talk all dirty jokes etc. This is a way by which I could spend maximum time with him. I m very possessive about him. We both love each other now, but in a platonic way. Also rest of the staff know snow that we both care for each other, but we are not gay in their thoughts. Why we should be? We had not had sex, and dont hope to have in future! Hope I m not wrong? What u say guys?</p>
<h1>GCI- I'd rather complete my assignment now, I guess.</h1>
