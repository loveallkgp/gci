<p>Hello, not a confession, i just came across a newspaper article, i think admins may like reading it..
So you know it's about a man who lived alone with 3 cats and he had a habbit of locking door everytime, finally his heart stops working and he gets unconcious and there was no one to help him and same with cats. After he died, these cats were confused, they needed food and they tried to wake their owner but nothing happened, neither they could open refrigerator nor they could go outside, so they started devouring their owner, hunger forced them to eat their owner's flesh . Finally 3 days after police force got the door opened and discovered dead devoured body and they didn't do anything with cats, they just understood this situation and let them go. I always wanted a cat, but after reading this news article...</p>
<h1>GCI- Is that a puzzle to judge the reading and observation ability? Cuz honey, who told the police that his heart stopped and the cats tried to wake him up but then end up eating the master?</h1>
