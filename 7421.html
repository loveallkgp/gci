<p>Hi.Namaste.</p>
<p>I have this confession ....</p>
<p>I came to know about this sexual category ...what we say as gay. N to accept it ...I took almost 4 years.</p>
<p>I searched, read a lot about this. In accepting my sexuality, this page also helped me a lot. Thanks to all of u.</p>
<p>I believe I have enough knowledge about "gay" concept.
But my friends "straight".... Have a totally different definition to "gay" concept.
They say none of the religion have ever teaches about homosex.</p>
<p>According to them gay is some one who is against the nature..
Being gay means an abnormality of mind. Those who need sex n can't get it easily by a women they get attracted to boys to satisfy their desires. None of my friend even like to see a gay. N for them gay means a boy wearing girls costume....(hijada).</p>
<p>I spend most of the time with my friends ...n I silently listen these all stupid things they discuss..Once I had tried to tell them what actually a gay is....but they just laughed n told me to grove up.</p>
<p>I searched in Hindu religious books..I found few...very few glimps about homosexuality....</p>
<p>In Islam I nowhere found even a single line saying homosexuality is creation of god.</p>
<p>Niethr I found anything in Christianity....</p>
<p>So m again confused...if god don't want his creation to be a gay..y he created us like this.?</p>
<p>N some of my lecturers argue that this homosexuality is creation of modern society..Advt making n all. It's not our culture its adopted from  other countries....</p>
<p>First of all I m confused about my sexuality...n now confused about do I need any treatment...?...
M so alone n different here in my city....</p>
<p>Fed up with asking myself "Gay.....!!!!! Y god y u did this to me..???"</p>
<p>Sorry for any grammatical mistakes...hope my feelings can reach u...</p>
<h1>GCIL- TBH...Monoethiestic faiths have no room for alternate sexualities and only 25 muslim countries acknowledge same sex relations and the world is moving on with religions controlling their existence and sexuality, albeit slowly but yes it is moving away from the grip of religion. Mkae sure u land on the side of no-clutches-of-religion.</h1>
<p>Goodluck.</p>
<p>P.S- There are people of the very same faiths practising religion yet being totally okay with their sexualities...get inspired from them if u can...coz they know how to live peacefully in the real sense.</p>
