<p>I dont know why i am confessing this, i was just sitting idle and numerous thoughts were entangling me while surfing facebook and GCI took my attention where i can share my thoughts....
So i am 20 yrs old guy ! Being the only child of my parents they (especially dad) want me to get settled in my life not just proffessionally but also in a family... Once i think that i cant spoil my n HER life getting married to a girl and the other time i get disturb when i think that i wanna get settle but with a GUY.... I cant marry a girl ! How will i tell them that am a gay n i cant marry a girl... I also dont wanna hurt them because its the wish of every parent that they wanna see their child getting married ! I dont know how am gonna face that situation... Abhi toh am just 20 and abhi se shaadi k baatein..... :(
parents ko na hurt karun toh apne aap ki life kharab kar baithunga aur apni khushi ke saath jaun toh mujhe shayad unhe khona pade...
Well thanks for reading also give your opinion ! </p>
<h1>GCI- Listen darling, everyone goes through such turmoil. It all depends upon how wisely you take your stand and present your reality to your parents. Wait till the time you get a stable relationship and then shower the truth upon your parents like some awesome glitters. Your parents have lived most of their life and provided for you just to make you independent and let you be happy in your own way. They only want to see you happy and can never be angry with you if they think about their child first and not of the society. Be optimistic.</h1>
