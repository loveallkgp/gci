<p>It is something i always want to post or say it at a platform,where my voice can reach to farthest..
M a 22 yr old straight person,i remember wen i was 6-7 yr old i was sexually abused by one of our family friend for 2-3 times(which i later know he was gay,but i dont have grudges ne against lgbt community),dat incident still haunts me. Somewhere it had me a inconfident person.&amp;,Sometimes wen i travel by metro or local train,i feel there is hand always trying to touch my crotch,rubbing his butt-cheeks on my dick,..such incident reminds of those incident.
So,I really want to ask if a persons callhimself proud gay..than y doing such thing which makes others less comfortable.i know many of u will abuse me..but wat i hav seen dis at first i couldn't blieve my eyes..
Gays (particularly from w.b.) are indulge in sexual activity at public place like theater,@ toilet at imprtnt plces like howrah/sealdah railway station,
esplanade public toilet..sp dis is really something to be proud of??</p>
<h1>GCI- I hear you. And I am sorry for whatever went with you. Always know that there are always the other side of a situation which you ignored. Yes, incidents like this do happen when men try to molest other men in crowded places and it is not sexuality specific. Girls also go through the same and it is bad for everyone. I am gay and if someone tries to touch me at a public spot I will feel ashamed and angry. I also agree that there is a lot of improvement required in the mindset of the gay people throughout the country but also know this that it is a combined effort of everyone to make every individual around them comfortable with what they are.</h1>
