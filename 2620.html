<p>Dear #GCI I have heard in morning Radio PRAVACHAN that in Sri Krishna Puraan theres one chapter that "Sri Krishna was so much Infatuated by his own good looking and handsome personality that he could not controll him self to LOVE and Do Romance with own Personality and that is why he CREATED "RADHA" and played Love and Romance." now the question is that though the Gay feeling and same sex love feeling was exsisting that time too, BUT it was NOT Accepted and that is why Sri Krishna has to CREATE FEMALE CHARACTER OF HIMSELF and then played Love and Romance infront of the Society... Another chapter from RAMAAYAN that " when Sri Raam and Laxman went to Janakpur for Sita SWAYAMBAR.. The whole citizen of Janakpur got so much INFATUATED by Sri Rams Handsome Personality that they all want to be his Lovers.. Not only females but even MALES were thinking the same and having Love feelings towards Sri Ram.. But it was not possible for Sri Ram to fulfil their Dreams, SO he PROMISED to all the DEVOTIES including MALES too that in his Next INCARNATION he will take Avataar as KRISHNA and all the DEVOTIES will born as FEMALES as GOPIES and then Krishna will play Romance LEELA with them and fulfil their Dreams." So here also we can see that Gay and same sex feeling was exsisting BUT again to fulfil those feelings the MALE DEVOTIES has to take BIRTH as FEMALEs GOPIES to play Romance with KRISHNA.. So again it Shows Clearly that Gay, same Sex feeling was PROHIBITED .. To fulfil these feelings one should have to MALE and FEMALE </p>
<h1>GCI- But I though Radha was an partial incarnation of Lord Shiv. Anyways, the same history says that Lord Aiyappa was born by the union of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiv. History is always conflicting if it is more than 2000 years old because many views can be written down and many verses of books can be translated into a million more meaning over the ages by people who decipher them according to their own views. Better not be saddened by the negative. Instead believe in what you want unless it don't harm others.</h1>
