<p>one night with a gay -
i really wanted to go outside after 12AM and it feels good. at that time there was a hindu festival which was going on , so shops didn't close even after 12, the place where i went that day was isolated and police rarely patrolled there. i went to a noodle shop and was having my noodles deliciously. a guy came and he too ordered noodles and he asked me 'may i sit with you?'. i said it's okay. there was no customers at noodle shop except us and we ate our noodles. when i went out of that shop to walk on streets, he asked me to hang out with him. we started chatting and exchanged general details and then he asked me to go to park with him. we were at park and thick trees surrounded us and he asked me that do i have a girlfriend?. i said no and then he told about himself that he was a gay. i was not shocked and i listened to him, he started telling about his personal life but i asked him not to do so because we had just met but he continued. he told me that he was gay and his parents got winds of this secret and they kicked him out of house and then he couldn't go to school after he was 17, he took a job in cafe and it turned out that the boss of cafe was a gay too, so he had sex with boss few times in a month and this gained him more money and personal space to sleep and then his boss was impressed by him and he introduced him to manager of a gay love hotel and my new friend had to have sex with manager to show how hot and wet he made someone whoever had sex with him and manager gave him a job and when he was 18 he became a gay prostitute. i was shocked because i was spending my time with a prostitute but he just looked damn attractive, he had manly body, fairer face and he was a total sex devil who could attract you like magnet attracts metal. he told me that now he is 19 and soon he will become gay porn star and he had already sent his application to porn companies. he had already collected enough money to go to usa. this may all seem a built up story but it's actually not. he asked me whether i want to have sex with him and i agreed and we went to his small apartment. he removed my all clothes and started kissing me and he knew every kind of kiss-french, spanish, dutch etc. i gave him a blowjob and he had anal sex with him. it was such a wonderful experience and we were hugging each other and kissing . he told me that i was so good at giving blowjobs and kissing. we bathed together and he was tired and sleepy. i prepared breakfast and left . </p>
