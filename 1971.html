<p>Hi Abby and Viv and all my lovely guys, don't hate me and I am not peverted. I am 30 bi , settled in IT, i have feelings towards girls and boys. Had sex with both but more with guys. Never fallen in true love and hopeless guy. I didn't marry a girl yet due to my siblings responsibilities and all family shit. Not getting a girl with my family background. My parents want to marry girl from my community.. Andhra Chowdary. Either I can't clean my family shit nor get a Bette girl. It's a dead lock I live in USA and I feel alone after coming home or on weekends... When my straight friends who has families are busy with their stuff.,. Even they invite I feel like empty as I am single and odd man out in front of all other couples. This pokes me to have a guy in my life. Not to fill the gap till marriage , I just want to experience guys love Atleast once in life. I dated a guy who consider himself as bi, long distance, he is good but coward being gay and he is unhappy with himself. He stopped relation and we r just friends. After that a local guy who is bi acted smart and lied to me that he loves me blah blah. He is a phd student and hard worker. I always think high of scientist as they are ambitious and genuine. This guy said " I have life in me and sweetest guy". I don't know that time he wants to enjoy me few times for sex and leave me. We were good for a month and he complained I am too much into him. I swear I never disturbed him with phone calls or in any way. Infact I encourage him to study. Anyways I didn't like his response and I now decided to move on .... Even my siblings never care me as a brother and always abuse me verbally both my bro and sis. I am the youngest. I am going crazy these days... My casual friend got married last year. I have fallen for her and I can't stop looking at her.. Thinking about her..She is my type and I wish I could get a girl like her. I had many opportunities to have sex and she is waiting for me to make a move. She is very close to me and I never tried to move as it will affect both lives. I feel like hell as I have love and lust on my friends wife. I tried to keep my self busy... I am building body and doing part time radio jockey to keep myself busy... But still always in the corner I am empty and alone. I tried to attempt suicide but I don't want to leave my parents in grief in this old age and they r only asset for me in this world Guys please pray for me to give some luck.</p>
