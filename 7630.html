<p>I'm 27 year old gay guy from a small town, quite comfortable with my sexuality. I havent come out to anyone yet, and dont see any necessity to do so, as of now. I have already decided never to marry a girl, and luckily, my parents never pressurize us on marriage. If I come out to them, I'm sure they'll ultimately come to terms with it, but I dont wanna subject them to that pain, especially in our homophobic society. I want them to think that I want to remain single. Now the issue is, recently I confirmed that my elder brother(my only sibling) is gay as well! I have been suspecting this since many years, but now I'm sure. The first thought that came to my mind is, how terrible this is to my parents! Kinda double whammy! But what to do? Thats how it is. My bro dont know that I know about this. I myself am not yet comfortable coming out to him. And my personal view is, I shouldnt confront him with this and let him decide whether to, when to open up. On other hand, I suspect he is struggling a lot internally, since being the elder son, he is be under more pressure than me. So should I confront him? Or should I let this status quo continue until I decide to come out first?  I hope you understand my dilemma. Let me know what you guys think.</p>
<h1>GCI- I think that as siblings it's your responsibility to support each other. If you know for sure that your brother is gay, maybe the initial step for you is to come out to each other and support each other. That's what I would do.</h1>
