<p>Hi admin ..need a piece of advice from you ... M in relationship with this guy since last month ....he loves me a lot ....he cares for me .....he,s possessive too ......but the thing is I dont have feelings for him ......i just accepted his proposal just to forget the person I love .....so everyday I hurt my bf with my words ,...i dont do it intentionally but I just cant have control over it,..... I still cant forget the person I love....he rejected me actually ...n that hurts ...,should I just keep going with my bf or should I leave him instead of hurting him....i dont feel like leaving him too he,s way too sweet ...but I cant forget the person I love......its killing me everyday ...</p>
<h1>GCI- This is the mistake that most of the people do that after break up they don't give themselves ample time and go for a rebound relation to forget the past. The guy gets hurt in the process as well. You should have given yourself some alone time to get you head back on track. If you go through same love feelings again when you haven't moved on, you are bound to get bitter. Take a break from this relation by telling this new guy everything. There can be two possibilities here. First, that he himself backs off to give you some space. Second, he can himself try to comfort you. But in all of this just try not to hurt him much.</h1>
