<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    In case you are entrapped in a situation like mine,here is a tip:
    Today,I met one of the hottest guy on this planet;Suave,handsome,witty.He is a scientist actually.
    So he was horny in the morning and I was having place.He pinged me a message and I told him to come.So the moment we got in my room,he grabbed me,stuffs started and it was such an awesome experience of having him with me.

    But!shit happened.I don&#39;t know from where my mom entered my room and bang!she found us naked lying over each other naked.I immediately rushed towards the other room,we dressed up quickly and he escaped from other side of the room.

    After he went,I told my mom that I was suffering from some skin disease and he was a guy that doctor recommended me to treat my body through massage.She agreed.Thank god!it did not turned out to be a mess.

    Now,We both will be having sex again but at his place.He and I so want it again and even after this serious drama we were laughing at the situation.

    He just got an amazing smile and huge d**k.My lips are now burning becoz of intense smooching and still I want more.Soon we will finish what we couldn&#39;t complete today.

<h1>Viv- And your mother bought that? She never asked that why the doctor had to be naked to massage you?</h1>
