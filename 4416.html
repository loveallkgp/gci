<p>Did you watch the weekend 22 nov episode of bigg boss. There is some argument and Dimpy calls Ali gay to insult him. Everyone else was laughing at it. There was lot of angry shouting how dare she call me gay and all that. He says if i am gay shes a bitch.
It was all so bad to use gay to mock someone and he feeling insulted </p>
<h1>GCI- Damn he was downright insecure by the word. Dimpy never used it as an insult. She just said that if he were gay and then he started ranting again after that which was completely pointless. I'd give him to that that he was already agitated but being insecure just because of a word when Sushant used to call him Kanta, is just plain stupid.</h1>
