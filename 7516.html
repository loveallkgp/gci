<p>Hello admin. This is my first post on this page and the one I am sharing is my first sex(apart orals :P ) experience as well which happened a week before on 17th june. I felt like sharing and getting advised.
My age is 20 and I have just given my 2nd year exams(pursuing B.tech from a very good Delhi College) and at present I am enjoying vacations in my hometown Meerut. As I am free these days so I go for evening walk in the area/road around my colony(actually on a road to nearby villages which is nearby as my newly developed colony is on the outskirts of city ). I enjoy green fields, cool breeze on the way. I also enjoy handsome boys bathing in the tube-well pools in their fields and a few peeing on the roadside. This happens around 16th of june that a man working in his field with a plough caught my attention. He was around 40 years of age tall may be 6 feet average color very hairy with mustache and beards, muscular build and sweating. He caught my attention because he was just wearing his underwear while working otherwise I really don't haunt for 30+ uncles. He also noticed me and possibly understood that I am gazing him. I passed across his field multiple times out of my desire to see him again and again, after 2-3 walks across his plot he stopped working and used a towel to clean himself but almost ignoring me. That day I went back home to reach home just before dusk. Whole night I was just thinking about him his body his muscles ...The next I got up early in the morning I planned for a morning walk in the hope of catching him. It was around 5:30 a.m. in the morning but can't find him in his plot....returned ...regretted my decision of morning walk.... and started planning for the evening walk.</p>
<h1>GCI- Boner killer. Just curious, you need advise for what? To get down on him? I ain't got one honey. Sorry.</h1>
