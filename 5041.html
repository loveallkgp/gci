<p>Hello all.. This confession is to sensitize the gay community of the prevalent predators in the society, trying to trap us and misuse our sexuality.</p>
<p>I am from Chennai. 32 years old. Last year, one day when I was alone at home, was searching to invite guys home. It was so coincidental that I got a call from a guy, who identified himself as a friend's friend, said he had deleted his profile on PR, but he was ready to meet me. Without even realizing I had never known him, I called him home.</p>
<p>He came around 3 pm, we chatted a lot. Then he said he has drinks. I used to be such a careful person not taking strangers home, not drinking from strangers etc. But that day, I was blinded to all these instincts, called a stranger home and drank with him from the drinks he had brought. I had two glasses of whatever he gave me.. Then the next thing I know is when my parents knocking the door NEXT DAY evening. For about 24+ hours, I was un-conscious and lying on my bed. He looted many valuables from our home and left, not sure when he left.. :(..</p>
<p>We did complain to police and they also tried their best. Police were in fact were co-operative and asking me sensitive questions, not trying to threaten me etc. But the investigation went nowhere due to lot of loopholes. The positive aspect of this incident was, my parents came to know about my sexuality and accepted me, but that came with a high price..</p>
<p>So guys, be very careful about whom you meet and whom you take home. There could be a lurking thief or a psycho waiting to harm you. I came out physically unhurt from this incident. Thankfully I never had sex too, else I don't know what bugs he could have given me. I got myself tested and cleared my mind.</p>
<p>Be careful about whom you take home or meet! First meet in public, have trust then proceed.. </p>
<h1>GCI- I am so sorry for you. Mistakes make you learn lessons.</h1>
