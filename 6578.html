<p>Hey, everyone! </p>
<p>Okay, there we go.
My boyfriend has just moved to Canada.
Thousands of miles!
I miss him and wish to be with him.
I'm trying to follow him but there's a thing that's putting me in distress.
He has a friend who'll be living with him there in Canada.
I kinda feel jealous. He's from New York.  He's rich. Actually, a star kid.
And, he just proposed my love.</p>
<p>I know I'm truly loved by my boyfriend and I can't talk to him about it.
Also, he won't tell him about me. I know it.
You're the only one who matters to me, he says.
I don't want him to mistake it the way that I don't trust him.
I do trust him. Totally
But
it's just a natural unrest in my mind.
What do you think I should do?</p>
<h1>GCI- It's a matter of trust honey and two way communication without keeping any secrets. You both should have that trust so that you could not be paranoid and he has to take care of it.</h1>
<p>PS- Who is that bitch hitting on your man? Tell your man to make a salad and toss him out of his bowl.</p>
