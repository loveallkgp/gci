<p>I have no boyfriend, aur na kabhi tha koi,I m 35 now to koi milega iss ki bhi umeed khatam, at times I have some sex friends, jo sex k liye milte the, but they left me, aisa nhi tha k ek time me maine do logo se sex kiya
m a bottom guy, one by one they came n left, from one year no one is in life, I really need sex, I dont know where to go, kahan jau mai apni iss ichha ko pura karne ke liye, aur meri aatma bhi pyaar ke liye tarasti rehti ha, jyaada tar log kehte ha k aap spiritual ho jaao, par mera inn baato me bhi koi yakeen nhi,</p>
<p>I hate for being myself a gay, it has ruined my life, not only on emotional level but also on professional level </p>
<h1>GCI- Don't blame your sexuality if you were not able to make right decisions at the right time. If you have really wanted someone, you could have stopped having random sex and actually gave a way to feelings for once. Which, I guess you never did. But you know they say, "There is no specific age for getting love." You will get it later or sooner. With love sex will also come but if you have hollow sex then leave all the possibilities of finding love because you will always crave for more.</h1>
<p>Tell you what.. what if you are 50 and your sex drive evaporates? At that age you will curse your past, "If I had paid much attention to finding a right partner, I wouldn't have been so alone." </p>
<p>So there is still time.. Make a better use of it.</p>
