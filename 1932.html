<h1>GCI- Honey, how can you be so blind? He doesn't love you! He is just using you for his anger dumping and maybe for sex. How could you be in a relation with a married guy and then take all his shit? Beating, seriously? You got to stop everything with him. I mean everything! Its good to feel wanted by someone but you really don't have to get abused by them in anyway. Honestly get some sense.</h1>
