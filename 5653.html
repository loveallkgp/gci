<p>Hii friends I am a gay guy from Delhi. I want to share some of my thoughts here . Lately I am not feeling very good and I am more than depressed ,I don't know what to do in future what to do in my life I mean I am gay I don't see anything in my future. Ofcourse I have a career but what next I cant survive life just by career and hobbies. As days are passing by its becoming harder to live all alone first it is very difficult to find a guy who is loyal and wont marry a girl over me who will not betray my love and who will love me .....or should I say its very hard to find any kind of "date-able" guys at all here  and then even when I find anyone like that where we will go I don't see any good future for gay community here in India. I mean imagine two guys living together somewhere and neighbors or society members always gonna interfere in their life! anyways please suggest me something motivating to live I am losing interest in life I don't want to die in an empty apartment lonely all by myself and no will find out cuz I have none in my life and my body will rot there! people will find me not because I am missing but because of the foul smell of my rotten body coming out of my apartment....please tell your plan for life suggest me something help me ....</p>
