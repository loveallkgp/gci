<p>I don't see any hope its like people don't wanna fight for their rights, they just want to stay in the closet and hookup with any random stranger they meet online. 
I know its hard, but why we choose society over what we want don't give them power to your life. I hope a day comes when we can love freely without being afraid but for that we have to start fighting instead of virtually hooking trust me its not all you have, there's more to life than just random, meaningless, hookups.</p>
<h1>GCI- I can think about a 100 things that why we need a revolution for gay rights in our country. Some people can say that most of the activism is done, there is only the need to change the laws, people are aware and shit. But it all happened in the US before Stonewall riots as well. People knew about homosexuality, they were against homosexuals because of the religious laws and the measures the authorities put in to take actions against homosexuals. I can see a similar pattern happening in India. We need a catalystic event.</h1>
<p>Now coming to your confession, I hope the day will come soon where people can be what they want, even if the society is opening its mouth in shock. I will gladly put a dildo there though.</p>
