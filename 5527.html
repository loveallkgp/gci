<p>Hi, I am 23 male from Pune. Actually my problem is that I have met a lot of guys here, I have also been physical with a few, but things never work out later. I have never been romantically involved with anyone I met, although I liked a few of those guys but they were not able to reciprocate those feelings back. I am kind of feeling hopeless because of this. Kindly suggest what to do. </p>
<h1>GCI- Sharing of feelings has to be a two way road. It doesn't happen on a single way. Maybe you behaved the same way to guys who had feelings for you like the others behaved for whom you had feelings. It's kind of a chain. Maybe you could try for dating someone and give sex a break. Knowing people as a person helps too, you know, rather than think about their body parts only.</h1>
