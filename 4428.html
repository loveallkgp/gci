<p>Hi everyone... actually its not a confession.. but a skeptical situation I'm going thorough... its been 6 months we are relationship.. he loves me lot.. n I too.. he is 23 now n good at every perspective....his love towards me is not expressible... but he told me that he started liking boys recently ...he happen to b victim of his friend who forcefully tried to have sex but ended up just giving bJ...its been only 1 year this incident had happen n I was told he started liking boys.... that's what I'm worried about....do such incident really make a person gay?...that to bottom?.... I enquired about his adolescent age n teen age ..he said he was attracted to very few selective gals..he is not a guy who just flaunts about his masculinity but if course he is manly.and I too believe him.....I'm worried coz we have so many plans in future..its quite mystery unsolved for me from so many months.... help me out guys please... would like to hear ...if someones orientation had changed from such incidents...</p>
<h1>GCI- Many things can be said upon this. Sexuality depends upon your genetics and the environment factors. Maybe that guy was already attracted towards guys but never found it correct so he turned into an introvert. Maybe he is just shy. All of this can be because he has some serious past conditions that turned him into a quiet person. The thing with these guys is that you have to slowly and slowly open them up about themselves. They are very much cautious about their comfort zone and don't want any interference, but if you are trustworthy enough then you can try to make him tell things but in a calm way. It is not gonna be easy but you should try to get him to talk to know what he wants.</h1>
