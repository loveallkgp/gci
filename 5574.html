<p>Hey guys out there.. :)</p>
<p>got this page today only.. and i read more than 100 confessions and got the conclusion that I'm normal and there are many guys like me too!</p>
<p>well I'm 18 years and a momma's boy and dad's partner :p .. i never had gay friends or never tried to search one.. i was confused between bisexual and Gay though i completely know the meaning of these words :p . i used to think even a gay guy can have sex with girl so how can they say they don't like girls. well even i never thought about sex with girls or boys :p kissing things is enough for me XD .. but i explained this things to my parents that i never got any attraction toward girls.. even in the hot videos (not porn, but the videos from the movies, the intimate scene) i keep noticing boy only.. i was confused and was surrounded by questions and imaginary world.. but yeah .. I'm the luckiest boy.. my dad said to me that I'm gay and mom said nothing wrong in it. but they warned me by saying not to involve in gay community more than limits.</p>
<p>it has been 8 months from then. and even my group of friends supported me ( though they taunt me by saying " hum pe nazar mat laga' hehe but they love the way I'm ^_^ )</p>
<p>so guys if you get any problems .. first share it to your parents. :D they rock :*</p>
<h1>GCI- It's good that your parents are supportive. Not everyone is that lucky.</h1>
