mujhe open hona. ..he....lekin jab bhi dad ke baare me.  .meri family ke baare me sonchata hu..
what happen to next??
:(</p>
<h1>GCI- I do know how it feels. I really do. I am at a new place, new country, for God's sake and I feel really lonely sometimes. But everything does falls into place buddy. If you need someone, just socialize with them, talk more, be friendly and develop trust with people. Let things happen on their own. Don't just jump onto them. As far as the position of your father is concerned, you know your dad the best. If you think that your sexuality won't matter to him, then tell him. If you think that you cannot accept any good reaction then its better to put the thought away until you are ready to be independent. In both situations, try to make your living in some other city away from your hometown. In the meantime, if you find a guy, make sure he holds you as closely as you hold him in every circumstance.</h1>
