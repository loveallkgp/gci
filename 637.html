<p>Hey Viv.... Know what???? I am fed up .... i know that am not gonna get a Gud Guy who will love me forever.... And i don't wanna Marry in my life coz am Gay....... Par ye soch mai Apney Dimaag se nikal nahi pata.... its badly affecting my Academic life.... Am pursuing Engineering and wanna progress and go as High as i can... but these feelings are somewhat bothering me a lot!!! Can you pls suggest how to get rid of it??? i know its not asy to get "RID" of it... but at least if not then how to overcome it..... Coz iskey chakkar mein i cant ruin My Career.... u know what sometimes i just dont look at guys when they are around me... or pretend as if there are no guys  which is totally unrealistic..... but kya karu!!! Dar lagta hai koi accha lag gaya, then again its gonna affect me only  Help me out!!!!</p>
<p>$ABBY : you can't say that no one will ever love you . as we are in studying age , we all are less mature and we judge book by cover ' looks , appeal and money ' but as we grow up get at the stage of life where we are working people a lot of serious , trustworthy people meet . who somewhat gone through same things . so boost your confidence .. connect with friends , do outing atleast get into physical exercising as it brings positivity in life . </p>
<p>about your studies . focus on them . how to ? well make  goals .. then aim them and try to get them . when feeling low spend time with family or siblings . see this study time is ' short' ... once its over and you get placed in nice company ... you will have lot of time to worry about marriage and other things . those are far away things. who marry at 24 or 28 these days . after 30 is marriage thingy .. and get it you are not the only one going through this ...</p>
