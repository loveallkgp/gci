<p>Hi Guys,
First of all Happy New Year to you all.
I am quite shy and introvert kind of person. Never in my life I ever had any problems. Or in other words, I never hurt anyone physically, emotionally or otherwise. Recently I hurt a lot of people. I was engaged to a girl against my will. I am bisexual but in love with a guy. So I don't want to have a miserable life and told the whole truth to the girl. Now, wedding is off but I am the center of criticism from everyone. Everyone is furious.
My friends treat me as if I have done some heinous crime. I am thankful to my ex-fiancee for not outing me. But I truly hurt her. May be I deserve all this.
Recently some friends were just talking about me at a bar and I walked over. I heard that they criticize me because I have cancelled the engagement. Initially I thought that they care about me, that they want me to get settled as I am of age. But now I don't feel like it. I tried to explain them everything without outing myself. But they don't even want to understand. Now I feel like they just want me to feel miserable. My parents and relatives are no different. They don't let go a single moment not mentioning how silly and stupid I am. Is it a crime to prioritize your happiness over that of your parents'. I was the ideal son before this drama but not I am the subject of criticism for all, even those who doesn't even have a right to say anything. I feel miserable and guilty. I have my bf and I am glad for that. But we are not together and in India, I don't know if we ever will be.
What should I do? I want to make peace with my family and friends. But don't know how to do that when they are not even ready to listen to me. I was planning on telling them the truth but my bf asked me not to. As it would like a double shock and they would take it in the wrong way. So I stayed mum about my sexuality?
What do you think guys? What should I do? And I know Simar (my bf), that you will always be my side. I wish my parents were as open minded as yours are.
Thanks.
Regards,
Prateek </p>
<h1>GCI- Well for an Indian family it is indeed a shock for an engagement to be canceled. Just say to them that you have your reasons, if you can't come out. But you did the right thing. You could never have been happy with her and your marriage have been a disaster. Don't feel bad for the words of your relatives. They can say anything to you but if you try to say you will be a bad person who "says" stuff back. Look at yourself. Your image is already down. It's better to make those mouths quiet. Just say to them, "My life, my decision. It has nothing to do with you. If you can't support me in my decisions as a family then please keep your criticism in your walls. I don't need them." And I guess you plan your future with your BF soon. I guess it's time for you now to make things rock solid for your future.</h1>
