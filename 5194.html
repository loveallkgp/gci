<p>Last day I was accessing my real facebook profile. I got a friend request from one of my colleague.. I responded to it. then I saw Facebook was showing a list of ppl to whom I may know and can add as a frnd.. I started to scan through the list.. after 2-3 known ppl, I saw a profile whose DP was familiar to me. I zoomed the picture and recognized, it was a guy to whom I met through PR some 5-6 months ago. I became confused how's he is coming in frnd suggestions on real profile.. I further scrolled the list and there were more than 20 ppl to whom I know through PR. The questions was how they came in my real fb profile. BT soon the question changed.. I was not familiar with even a single name.. I met those ppl.. but the name which were told to me was not same or did I I even bothered to ask their name before I met them and finally ended into bed. A feeling of guilt swept over me. what the hell I am doing.. meeting random ppl on random basis and having random sex.. then I made a list of ppl with whom I had sex till now.. list went over 50.. and hardly I remember the names of 4-5 ppl .. who knows Even they were real or not..
I know what I have done is not correct by any means. I have become a character less soul.. its just because of ppl like me society don't accept gays..
and why I was doing this. because I felt I was cheated by a guy to whom I met on web. I was blaming him and getting a excuse to do all this. the guy to whom I never met. may b he never considered me more than a friend .. Is it necessary if I like someone he also shall have the same feeling for me??
what I have done can't change. but will try to improve myself for future.. it will b hard to suppress my feelings , lust actually.. this will b a test for me.. how strong I am.</p>
