<h1>GCI- If you want to be sure about your identity, then go for whatever method you can imagine about that can help you. If you are gay or bi, there is nothing wrong with that. Its just a part of your identity, like you are intelligent, maybe a good singer, you may have an awesome wit, your sexuality is a part of your identity. You are not at fault. Others are at fault who think about identities differently.</h1>
