<p>Hai friends and admins ! first of all Big salute for GCI.. I need a suggestion yar.. Am in a relationship for more than 6mnths.. And its going well.. Yesterdy I hav faced awful moment and it was disgusting me lot.. One of my collegue is staying wit me in room, He is good frnd of mine. Last night he just tried to seduce me.. I was just ignoring.. I cant say am gay to him.. If i do then the chance of seducing exceeds d limit might be! And I cant get angry n him as i never wanna loose his friendship.. And i wanna be loyal to my partner badly as well.. I cant shift room by anyway as its a office accomodation .. How can i handle dis? Somehow Last nyt i hav just escaped frm it.. I dont guess I can get rid of it for all the time.. Surely he ll be moving tonight with extra tactisms in his pockets.. ;-) Can u guys please suggest me how can I come out of his urge' zone? </p>
<h1>GCI- The next time it happens, imagine your partner and your emotions to be loyal to him. AND, if you are not okay with your roommate making moves on you, just say it to him on his face like "whatever is going on, this has to stop. I don't want to jeopardize our friendship." Be a little strict and stand to your grounds.</h1>
