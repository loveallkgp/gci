<p>hi everyone. 
I'm 19yr old.i knew I was gay from young age.i wasn't a social person at all.and by the time I was in 10th I was really social, lots of friends. There was this frnd I trusted very much and I told him I was gay.he was fine with it and supported. 
but then he gossiped about it and told everyone. life was hell for me.</p>
<p>then wen I joined 11th.it was new start.
about 6 mnths later one of my old friends spread it here as well. 
life turned hell again.</p>
<p>this male teacher started to flirt with me and tries to seduce me.
some of the other teachers are totally against me.
then there's this macho clasmate who took my virginity.i love him.but its "just sex" for him.
people teases me a loooot. and my family completely ignores the subject. "no comments" from them.</p>
<h1>GCI : see i  will not say that you shall not explore yourself sexually but write now in school life don't dot it . avoid telling about your gay self or having sex with any male close or near to you . ( ofcourse they are always the one who spread rumors after eating the plate surprisingly people never judge them ) .</h1>
<p>11th and 12th is critical stage . don't look for trouble and control it . after 12th when you go in college then think of having sexual relation or love relation that to with a person who can't bad mouth you in your relatives or friend circle.</p>
