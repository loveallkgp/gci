<p>My confession is that I have nothing more to confess. All my thoughts, all my confusions, all my feelings, as and when they occur, I come right here and pour it all out. Anything worrying me, I come here. Help is just a few clicks away and that's greatly comforting.
Anyone feeling down, dejected, unhappy or just bored? Just pour your heart out in a confession. I can tell you from my own personal experience, more than the advice or suggestions you get, the comments that you get saying that there are so many like you experiencing the same situation, is greatly comforting.
We're all going down a tough path. There are many who turn to drugs and alcohol when they feel it's all too much to live through. These are never a permanent solution and just spoil your health. I say confess here!! You'll see the results for yourself. :-)</p>
<p>PS: Thank you for this page admin. I wish that a few years down the line, you too are interviewed by some celebrity on some show, and we'll be so proud to see you knowing you made a huge impact in our lives.</p>
<p>With lots of love
- A secret admirer ;-)</p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks a lot for such kind words. It is precisely that we look for is to make an impact on someone's life through our experiences. Getting on a tv show will hardly matter. But what matters is making people feel good about themselves, to show them a better way and not make them feel alone.</h1>
