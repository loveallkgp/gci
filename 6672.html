<p>I am a student of 11th grade but I'm 19 years old because my parents got me enrolled at school when I was 5. Even though, People around me are younger than I am, so I made some friends who are in college, they all are gay. Almost all of them have boyfriend, so when they ask me when I'm gonna lookout for a bf, I'm like "oh no no, I am fine alone", when I look at my friends and the way they pamper or get pampered by their boyfriend, that's so cute and I'm like 'awwww' and I do envy them but nowadays I don't feel like I need anyone, it feels like I'm even experiencing the loss of sexuality, No sexual desires and I prefer to stay alone, sometimes I find myself talking with me in crowded areas. Seems like I'm self obsessed. Earlier I was used to be all by myself, crying in my room or some other place, wanting a boyfriend whom I could love, make him mine and kiss him all the times, pampering him.
Everything just changed and this it took me so long to notice this psychosocial change. 
Now, it's like I wake at 5, go to gym, then school and read books,  seems like I have become so cold and boring and this all is so boring.</p>
<p>Sorry for boring you all guys.</p>
<h1>GCI- Why the fuck are the gay guys not more in number like you?! WHY GOD WHY???</h1>
<p>Honeydew U r perfectly fine coz u have reached a very saturated level of maturity and trust me it's self love and not self obsession provided u r not a narcissist. 
U have not become cold, its just a phase of understanding the society and things at large. Intelligent people talk to themselves(when they r alone-psychological fact).
Just remember one main thing-
In the process of BEING YOURSELF don't meander and become an all consuming asshole. And the thing u r going through these days is just one of the ways to feel the COMPLETE ourselves and then becoming the very kind of person which we always wanted to become.
I personally loved answering to such a nice and matured post.</p>
