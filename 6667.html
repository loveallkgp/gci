So this guy with whom i was chating since a year. we met many times it was nothing sexual b/w us. But he was so sweet in meeting n i write confession too regarding our meet how cute it was! So he start ignoring me n after that cute meeting i start caring fr him! He said he z fed up of sex n want smthing stable n lol stupid me i start seeing him as my prince charming haha :D n i was thinking only hot guys r jerk..avg lookers r so sweet lyk him. so it was his bdy i planned it vry spl i wanted to surprise him that i remember his bdy n he jst told me once..i txted he says who r u? R u insane? so many people wish me on bdy..i cant identify u sorry..i nvr saved ur no. haha  :D lol thn i said chk wtsapp dp he said i nvr met this guy n u r mentally unstable..ruined my whole bdy :) .. kb se wait krra tha uske bdy ka i even made notebook for him.. kya kru ab uska? i should burnt it or tear it! I nvr tried to clingy wd him..msg bhi bhut sochke krta tha that too in weeks bt again jisko khone ka dar hota hai wo door chala hi jata hai :) </p>
<h1>GCI- Can u please stop self pitying for the moment and just fuck move on because that guy was a total jerk and u r acting even a bigger jerk than him.</h1>
<p>STOP following the FUCKING notions of prince charming, kissing frogs, being the damsel in distress and above all the pathetic gay princess. Instead work on your persona, your intellect, rockstart your life again with new things and learn something new helpful to bring the best in U.</p>
