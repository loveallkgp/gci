<p>Hi All.... 
Greetings.... 
I am From Chennai......
I always enjoy being who i am.... And its been more than six years now , that i know about my orientation......Initially juz like any other guy , i wasn't serious how things might go in the life of a gay..... So  , I later reached a point to have something concrete for life , now i have few friends who are gays, for life time and secondly i was pondering to get in to relationship but things ended up like damp squid......But as the saying goes , time will change every thing , yes its been a while now that i have started chatting with a guy , and he is a church priest and he is 36 and i am 26..... I am wondering , we both initially started the conversation very normally but dont know how things happened between us..... Our conversation will just have decent vocabulary..... We are affectionate to each other , and he says he loves me but at the same time his social status is bothering him.....He says , he has been longing for affection though he have couple of people around him , his longing for love is beyond.... and he even feels guilt about this desire cuz of his social life..... We are confused , he says he will get over it and lead only spiritual life not from heart though..... But am confused as well.... I have so many wishes which his profession will not allow him to do in public... Even associating himself close to someone , which is not allowed, for what is meant to be Priest life socially..... I am thinking not to take this forward to a level i  will just block him in all the way possible and i think i am too selfish , I am caught between two stools and feel entangled.....Pls give me some input........</p>
<p>Any suggestions , will be highly appreciated!!!</p>
<p>Admin Pls Post this...... </p>
<h1>GCI- Ooooh boy... a best friend of mine was unfortunate enough to meet this overly religious guy. Each time after doing the nasty, that guy would take a shower and pray for forgiveness. The kind of indoctrination that people go through over religious is the reason why most of the people are unhappy not content in their lives.</h1>
<p>Coming to you now, your guy can be with you and be religious as well. He has to choose between his own identity or the social status. Two can also go hand in hand if he is unapologetic about his identity, which is his reality. He should be wise enough to see life from a different perspective.</p>
