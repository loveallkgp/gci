<p>I have dark skin so everyone sees my picture and rejects me. For many years i tried to find someone who liked me for who i am than my looks. Finally in desperation i visited a local gay cruising area after dark. There were many guys there but most ignored me. I went to a darker area where one guy wearing a cap whose face i couldnt see clearly, whispered to follow him. I was numb and blindly followed him. He pushed me on my knees and asked to suck him. After he came, he suddenly spit on me and said chakke ki aulad agli baar teri behen ko leke aana chudwane. Suddenly i felt very ashamed on losing my virginity this way. I cried a lot of my way home and wanted to die. I showered 2-3 times and couldnt sleep. I used to throw up when ate anything or thought of sex. My mom took me to doctor thinking i was unwell. I just feel disgusted of gay sex after that and never meet any gay. But writing about it here makes me feel a little better since i cant talk to anyone about it</p>
