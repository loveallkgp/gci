<p>i just wish (everyday) thay while a walking on streets, a huge bus or car comes and hits me or lightning strucks me or the roof crashes and kills me or i am at the mountains and my friend pushes me , so i get thrown away. i just wish my life ends because i have lost that desire to live but there's no desire to commit suicide as well, i just want to get killed or murdured, i wish i can find someone whom i can give money, so they come to .y house, kidnapp me and kill me . it's not like that u want to die because i'm gay or because i don't have anything but i just don't want to live, i just want to die...i am fine, everything is there, all can go to govn. after my death, all i want somebody to take my lufe away, you may all criticise me that thinking such things is not a good thing but i know what's good for me...i just felt like telling everybody</p>
<h1>GCI- Damn! Why so negative? You need a therapist buddy. Have you looked at your writing skills? What a waste of talent it would be if you kill yourself. Everyone is sent on this earth with a purpose. Everyone here has a purpose and no one's purpose is to die without any reason. Make some dreams and start living.</h1>
