<p>Actually it's not a confession but a glimpse of reality for sweet people who got cheated:</p>
<p>I've seen the case many a times where people cheat their partners for some reasons, most common reason is double crossing or in simple words CHEATING.. Why do people cheat? SEX is the foremost reason, people not getting sexual pleasure form their partners and suddenly after getting caught with xyz, he's termed as sex FREAK which is totally wrong, a human body need sexual pleasure at some point, obviously and when he doesn't get from his partner, he seeks outside.. A relationship cannot be sex free at this time 2014.. some people hold on the urge untill one of em start breaking out and then complain that his bf has cheated.. WTF.. pehle tum use tarsao sex k liye aur jab wo bahar muh maare to usi ko gali do.. and some people are so sweet that they don't even move ahead after kiss and then again complain their partners for cheating them, same reason.. and in some, both are so sweet where both are not interested in sex much but after sometime, one is get caught with the third person coz he was seduced by that third person.. buddy when u have shared everything with ur partner, what's the problem with sharing ur bed? why do u let others seduce ur partner when he can drown into u 24*7.. in simple words make it li'l interesting, try to experiment..</p>
<p>What i want to tell is that SEX is an integral part of a relationship.. when you have shared ur "man &amp; dhan" there mustn't be any problem with sharing ur "tan"..!!</p>
