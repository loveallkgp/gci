<p>Hi, Am 20, i like to share sum opinion abt being a gay, which is that, every men has a GAY inside them. Myself a 'Bi'. Bt they wanna hide it because they love to lead a Normal life, especially in India. If u do compel them in the right way, they will fall for you, depending on the situation !!! There is no need to worry about your Glamour or cock size. When u r too gud inside, nothing else matters. If no one is falling for you, Change ur attitude towaed people. and believe me , its not simple as u read. I became a 'Half gay' because, i had a troubled childhood and a confused teenagehood (I think many of you do). i had encounters with my cousins and friends to get some tension free and relief for my mind atleast for some time. Atfirst, i feel guilty about sexin with them because they were all straight guys (not so straight) and they still live among me like nothing had happened. The truth is one part of me hates being a Gay and Other part cannot control myself when a guy approches me. In india, Being Gay is a Challenge, and you donno what your limit is. May be SRK or 
Aamirkhan had gay sex before with some guys, who knows? ;-)</p>
<h1>GCI : to be frank i think str8 guys exist who won't have sex with a man ever ( except if they are put up with a guy in a jungle where there is no women and he is the only chance to have sex)</h1>
<p>but you can be right coz all the str8 guys have at sometime in childhood or teenage time have tried things with their friends . gay things ... :P out of curiosity and sexual exploration .</p>
