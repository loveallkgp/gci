<p>so this confession is a bit different and i need advice from you on this. so you know the exams JEE-Mains and JEE-Advance right? I've qualified in both but bottom line is that i haven't scored a lot in either to get good colleges. I can get into an NIT or an IIT but barely and with scarce chances and in lower branches. I know I tried a lot so I'm not devastated by it but i don't know about my parents. Its not wrong of them to get disappointed and I don't think that they're doing anything wrong either by ignoring me right now and that's where i need advice. My dad, whenever something like this happens, stops talking to me and when he does talk to me he taunts and gives me a bit of a cold shoulder.Same happened when i came out to them. I don't know how to approach any of that. I can hide my emotions by keeping a straight face but that too goes against me. They're not wrong at all and I don't blame them for anything at all. I just don't know what to do when my dad does talk to me later and gives me a cold shoulder. Do i ignore him or confront him or what else?</p>
<h1>GCI- See if you can get into an NIT or IIT why should it still be a fuss that you didn't score that good a rank? If you do manage to get into either of them, every branch there has such a bright chance to get you placed. Moreover whenever you enter a college the rank is thing of a past because you start from a new level. I don't know about these colleges but according to the rules of my college if a person scored more than 70% in this first year without any supplis, he was eligible for the branch chance for the second year and after. Maybe the college you'd go to will have this provision.</h1>
<p>Now about your dad, just ignore and do not raise your voice. You just have to make a career for yourself. If you do not know what to do when your dad is behaving indifferent, pick up a novel or any other book and start reading it. Do not give any reaction to him as he is not being brutal. Most of the parents taunt their kids when they don't get the expected score but what is required is a bit of compassion from them and understanding that every kid can't be a genius.</p>
