<p>Hey .. i have a big story to share.. story of my life.. I'm 22. till last year I used to be a mast maula, happy-go-lucky guy... But then my life turned upside down.. I was in pune when I met HIM in one party. both of us were with our gfs . our gfs were friends with each other n that's how we became friends... soon we both shifted to Mumbai.. so we took a flat together.. last august .. once when he was asleep.. I happened to check his internet history coZ I had some doubts.. n it was filled with gay porn searches.. I couldn't resist n kissed him while he was sleeping... he didn push me back instead we kissed for a long long time.. soon we both fell for each other.. n I really became a guy I never thought I would become.. I cared for him, loved him, wanted best for him.. forever... soon v both broke up with our gfs.. n we were having d best time.. I never thought I would b so fuckin happy with a boy. we used to walk hands in hands, watched tv series late night in one bed sheet.. bathed together.. fought.. cried.. partied .. but soon he got his joining in delhi n I too had to leave for banglore .. we continued over phone.. It was working perfectly though we had fights everyday... but we made sure we don't go to bed with sad mind...this Feb he told me we are crossing d line as we know we both have no future.. we both had always talked about it.. but that thing hurt!! so I didn talk to him for a week.. after a week I came to know he slept with a guy.. I was paralysed... that moment I was numb.. but I forgave him.. but we broke up!! n promised to b friends as always.. but I'm still not over him. so I've to confess to all those people whom I met on FB...sorry for denying ur proposal as u know now I'm still not over him. n I can't b. .. I'm rahul arora.. hope u know d story now n forgive me. I'm not a bad person just not able to come out of it. </p>
<h1>Viv- Shit, I'm so sorry to hear that. Assuming that having no future together is never an excuse for anyone to break up. There can be upside down but if it isn't toxic then you can carry on. And this loyalty! Why do people cheat? This is what makes me sad. After the honeymoon phase of the relationship, when a couple has to go real in life, they choose to break up. How is that even justified?</h1>
