<p>I am a 21 year old student n am thinking of coming out to my elder sister this winter. Am scared n have no idea how c will react. Am not even sure n have been thinking a lot abt this, will it b ok to come out to my sister or is this a terrible idea. It will really help me if anyone have any experience regarding this matter n is willing to share their experiences in the comment section.</p>

<p>From our side the suggestions are-
1- See to it that your sis is phobic to lgbt or not!
2- Do think of your self dependent status.
3- Do not think that its gonna be all scary or all hunky-dory. Be prepared for both the situations.
4- Never allow yourself to be weighed down because of your sexuality. Its fine that it makes u what u r but does not define u 100% of what u r capable of.
5- U need to have a blueprint of your future life where u can sustain on your own, with or without a partner. Make yourself ready for that first.
6- U need to consider the fact that who are the other important persons u need to come out to.
7- U also should consider that whether u r strong and mature enough to handle the so called pressures post coming out!</p>
<p>P.S- After all the considerations are clear and checked...go ahead my boy and embrace your truth and let it disintegrate in the air and be all what u r and all that u are yet to become.</p>
