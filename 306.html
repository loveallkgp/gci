<p>I was in a relationship with my best friend. We kiss each other n had some shirtless love making scenes n bed. Due tomany reasons we parted away for nearly a year n so. In tht due course i joined a new colg fr my highers. There i met a new guy, who has a sexy boy. He s so frndly with evryone here n my best friend ever to me here. Many of my cls mates teases me by callng my name with his surname. Outsidde i scold them, but inside i m happy to hear thosse teasings. I feel irritated when he go out wth othrs n his bike. He is one of my best support drng my bad time n new college. My heart wud b n cloud9 while i m sitting wth him in bike. Recently my old bf apologized n say tht he want patch up ( he s straight)???? i dunno wat to do?</p>
<h1>Viv- You mean he proclaims that he is straight? Anyway, first find out the about your fight with your old bf(if you could call it a relation). Then work out that if you two get back together what are the chances of of you both staying together as partners. Now about that second guy, you seems like much more romantically involved with him. The jealousy and excitement, they easily give you away. Does he feel the same? Is he straight? Will he be comfortable with gay stuff if he is straight? And between these two only you can choose one of them because only you know them. :)</h1>
