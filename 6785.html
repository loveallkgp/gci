<p>For Confessor #6779
From Confessor #6770/#6784</p>
<p>Dear, I know what you're going through. I know that it's tough coming out to others. I'm a Transwoman (male by body and female by heart and soul), and it started around a decade back. I came out to my teacher, Doctor, Psychologist, Psychiatrist, my brother and sister, and some of the members of the startup which I'm working in. I told those members on 15th August. After that, I opened up to my elder sister and brother, and then to my sister's close friends. Felt better after opening up to them. Even opened up to my roommate and my best-friends in my College and my previous school. A week back I opened to my parents and my dad asked my what I've thought about doing. He scolded me and I felt like crying more when he scolded me for that. Even now I feel like crying but, I'm happy that only my family doesn't support, but at least I have the support of about 50 people until now. I will complete my education and work for some time and then get the operation done, and then maybe my parents would accept me the way I am. So, I just want to say that "Don't lose hope". There is still somebody, somewhere, who still cares for you.</p>
<h1>GCI- Glad that there is a dialogue going on on this page about trans issues among people rather than the usual gay stuff about straight love and other things. It's good to read something different and more better.</h1>
