<p>Fristly I Thank the person Who made such a blog where we can express our feelings</p>
<p>I am Basically From Tezpur.I Bring and bought Up inTezpur .At The Tender like Other kids I Too used to Have Friends. I Have done my Schooling From Sacred Heart School which was located Near Gharpara chuburi .</p>
<p>As like normal Child I used to play with my friends but as i when to VI standard . I found A guy Name Subham Started bulling me. Itz unbearable He used to adress me with diffrent Names </p>
<p>Everyday I went to school The Same Things repeat . </p>
<p>Gradually It got inimesed day by day he. then The whole class Started </p>
<p>There is No one to Make me friend . As if i had sum Harmful desease .  There is No one who like to sita with me. Everyday night i used to weep . </p>
<p>I told my mom that i Dont want to go to school But she asked me what is the reason </p>
<p>I kept Silent </p>
<p>These continued For 10 years . </p>
<p>Now I am 20 I'll be completing my b.Com 
but Now also nothing changed </p>
<p>Today also I am alone ??</p>
<p>Kya Ya mera galti hai .Kya M in Sab ka imeda hu. 2 bar sucide karna chaha Par Nakayam raha ....
I Dont know what is For me in future ::: But. at present it Is difficult to live a Gay life . 
Please Friends Pay for Me</p>
<h1>GCI- DO NOT loose hope and don't give those bullies by putting up a sad face. You are better than them. The more you give up, more they will say things. Remember, your self respect comes first. Also, NEVER EVER THINK ABOUT SUICIDE. You can never let your fabulous life end because of some pieces of trash at all. Think wisely, darling.</h1>
