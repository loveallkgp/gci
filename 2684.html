<p>We planned to have sex in our 1st anniversary. I never had sex neither i kissed anyone in my life. That was my worst nightmare. When i tried to give him oral, i could not fit his thing in my mouth. He gagged me forcefully. I was so tired but he tried to have sex with me. I stoped him somehow. Now he says that he wants to have sex and i just stop him by diverting the topic. I love him very much but im to scared to take that inside me. I just too big :( and i swear if it was like Himalayas; i could only make it to first base. How do i ease up my ass to take that thing. Should i try it out with other to make it loose? Help me please im confused :( i sound like crazy :x</p>

<h1>GCI : you have african bf ????? :O ( last time i saw big thing , it wasn't on indian guy :P just kidding ) . anyhow its going to be very kinky advise ever on page :P so people who get offended easily don't read .</h1>
<p>okay. if you think it big for you then you shall tell him not to force you . its body part and it takes time to stretch ( you know the asshole) . try fingering yourself so as basic start to make it loose . then try some dildo ( always lubricate ) . try these things for atleast a month so that you make a stamina to hold things in and really sex is tiring for both tops and bottom . you can do foreplay  with him , body kissing , hugging , kissing licking , touching , giving hand job and let him finger you .
and for blowjob let me tell you its not required that you have to take the whole penis inside . the most sensual veins lie on penis mushroom or dick head . so focus there with your tongue. hold penis shaft with you both hands and massage softly up and down and in circular motions . its like handjob and blowjob together .</p>
