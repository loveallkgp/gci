<p>Umm..Well my confession is simple.I have always felt attracted to men who can take lead,who are efficient and who can control things.A strong male physique and a dominating personality attract me.I have a pretty considerable social standing and an active social life.Coming out may hamper that but honestly I dont care.I can come out and live and endure anything if there is that dream man beside me.But I cant endure the wrath of society when I am lonely.
I dont know maybe what I say doesnt make sense or its incoherent .Every other night I wish there were more gays I could really connect with when I open facebook.I either find people asking for my pic,which I agree to show if we can manage to connect but no one has the patience for it.Other than that you have people who engage in sleazy flirting which turns me off immediately.The pity is I hardly find a man with whom I would hook up if we met on the street and had an interesting conversation.I cant undo,forget or erase my education and upbringing just to hook up with any random guy for the sake of sex.I have a pair of hands for that thank you so much.
Guys I have never blurted out such things to anyone till now.If you have the time and the desire then please read and tell me whatever you feel.I dont mind if you criticise me,call me immature,stupid or anything.</p>
