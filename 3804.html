<p>Hey admin....u r jst fab...ur way of answering the confession is jst awsm.......plz help me yr...... .i m nt gay i m bisexual......yr mujhe interest h boys mai...bt yr i want to leave all this ....i tried many tines bt yr control ni hota. I would be back again and again.......i m going to be married soon.. Dar lagta h yr kahi meri is life ka effect meri married life pe na ho.....bht tension h yr..plz tell me kya karu.....</p>
<h1>GCI : see as part of loyalty  if you are bisexual your wife/husband shall not be kept in secret about your sexuality . after knowing this if they still want to marry you , there will be less problems in married life . if they get to know about your sexuality later and you by chance get caught in act by anybody will affect you , and your partner will of course think you as disloyal person and a fraud .</h1>
<p>but now as about your situation , because of indian culture and present laws you are forced not to come out ( believe me i know how hard it is to be a bisexual as everybody be it gays , straights or parents will say you to choose one . which is wrong .) and tell anybody . 
as far as i can think of there are two right options </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>drop the marriage with straight girl and find a bi sexual women . </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you gonna marry this girl then be loyal towards her and never get into you gay life or else bear the fruit .</p>
</li>
</ol>
