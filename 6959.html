<p>Hello admin,i hope u post this soon... Well i am from assam,19, bengali and ya i am gay. Besides this gay thingy i hav a lot more problems in my life.... I am not from a wealthy background, my father is paralytic and is on bed since 8 years. My mom is a houswife. Since my  father is sick i had to take care of of my family both moneterily and socially. Anyhow i completed my matriculation then higher secondary and now i am pursuing B.Sc and i am in 3 rd sem now... Its been lots of stress on me.. I am unable to think clearly.

I have been doing tutions since my father got sick,but its not dealing fine... Huge amount of time goes away.... Please helo me admin what to do please</p>
<h1>GCI- My cousin had the same situation. After she did her high school, her father got on bed, physically ill, not able to move and totally dependent on help, she had to take care of the money of the house and study herself. Not only did she studied further, she grew up to be a microbiologist and was one of the major doctors in the city of Amritsar.</h1>
<p>I'd ask you to carry on because one day you will be proud of yourself.</p>
