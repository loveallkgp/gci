That really hurts ..if he doesn't want to be in a relation y did he get close to me :(</p>
<h1>GCI- You might have mistaken his signals, if he gave any. In the beginning everyone will care for you. Its very easy to get swayed. But its good that he made his stand clear at the right moment. See, you cannot force him to do anything that he doesn't want. So, if you want to stay away, then stay away or if you want to be with him as a friend, you can do that too.</h1>
