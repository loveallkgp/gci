<p>Againsion #3011,
You are my new idol! Sorry admins I have to say this, but 90% of the confessions here are by crappy people who just want to whine about their life. I have been line that some time ago and right now studying hard to become independent, prove my with and then come out of the closet and tell all the homophobes to fuck themselves. 3011, you are truly a great person. My heart missed a beat when I read that you tried to commit suicide, because to even consider such a wonderful person vanishing chills my bones. But my face is not just lit, it's burning with smile. Like my passion right now. And thanks for reminding me, that the world right now isn't that hopeless yet :)
If you are reading this, you have gotten a fan for life here. I am 18, and I experienced pedophillia myself, but fortunately not something that physically scarred me but emotionally changed forever. I deny it when my friends believe that pedophillia changed my life, but I know it did, and I do sometimes wish it never happened. But I do love myself now. And even more now, because my passion to live and to have a meaningful life had just been quadrupled by you :D
Again, if you are reading this, all the very, very, VERY best :) Love you and your boyfriend. He is the luckiest guy in the world and even though I don't believe in destiny or "good and bad", I would still hope that I am wrong and that your masi, who must be a wonderful, amazing woman, will accept you because you've had enough bad experiences in life and you deserve to be only happy now because YOU HAVE EARNED IT.
To all those who have any prospect of suicide in future, please raise you hand right now if you are reading this... Yes... Just like that... And bloody slap yourself, fool. Life is only as beautiful you want to make it. Beautiful life won't fall out of sky. It's time you look out for yourself. It may seem dark right now... It may seem that life cannot go on, that the world is cruel and meaningless...I know how it feels because I have been there... Please, please hang on to yourself. Give yourself a chance if the world doesnt, and FORCE the world to give you a shot at your life. I beg of you, have patience, for you never know if your life has a wonderful surprise waiting for you in future, just like 3011's :)
It might be preposterous of me to ask this of you, but 3011, if, and only if you are okay with it, and if the admin doesn't mind, let's get in touch, I will drop my email ID in the page's inbox. Lol, sorry for the trouble GCI ;)
Thanks anyways!!! To both, 3011 and GCI. You both rock! :D</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, I don't blame you.. he is indeed special. (y)</h1>
