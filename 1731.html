<p>Hi friends . I am 21 yrs old guy and this is my story . Must be a god's curse , I was thrown away by my birth parents just few hours after my birth :( I was totally rejected. Still now I am in search of them but couldnt able to find a single clue about them ;( .Somewhat I was privileged enough to get the love of parents as my living gods*( My adopted parents) adopted me :) . They brought me up in such a way that I shuldnt feel the emotions of orphan .I got my IDENTITY in this society because of them. In my family everyone loves me a lot even more then der own birth children.:) My parents are too emotional about me that if I start hanging out with my friends or some other third person , they fear that I may be mind washed by friends and I may leave them and for this purpose they wont allow me to mingle too much with outside world . And I respect there views. :) Coz they have given me life and I owe them my life .I came to know about my sexual orientation in college days .Now I am so bothered about being GAY :(. I tried all possibilities of changing myself atleast for sake of my parents , but all efforts went in vain :(.My parents dont even know about homos coz dey are so innocent and for them I am the life. My relatives are against Homosexuality coz I hear ill speaks about homos from them :( ;(. My parents are having great desire and dreams of me getting married to a traditional girl . They are eagerly longing to play with der grandchildren . How can i ever think of showing my Gay Identity for them who have given me Basic IDENTITY in the society?? :( Isnt it a Betrayal?? Wont der purpose of bringing me up to this level will be thrown to mud in a second for sake of my desires?? If I marry , wont I be guilt about being not truthful to my wife?? This thought is eating me day by day like termite :( Stress is building up day by day. I cant end my life coz if I do that i wont be providing justice to all those care and love shown by my parents. At the same time I cant change my orientation coz its embeded deep inside my Blood. Or I cant marry a gal coz I believe in being truthful and loyal to my partner. I am shattered :( ;( All paths are closed for me. Please, I dont say being Gay is bad,(even I am proud of other GAYS) But in my situation , being GAY posing me serious problems.:( Oh , God if u wouldnt had made me gay, all these problems would not have arised . Depression is my shadow which follows me all the time ;( :( # No life .No hopes.</p>
<h1>Viv- Touchy. Listen, if they love you so much why don't you try to tell them. Hug them up and blurt it all out to them. You do not owe them your life, you owe them the truth. Make them educated about your sexuality and how you want to live. I'm pretty much sure that they will understand you and will stand by you.</h1>
