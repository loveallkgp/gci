<p>Hi All 
I am 24 year old from UP, working in Pune for an IT company. I am a Transgender and I am attracted towards men sexually. I have had many sexual encounters with gay men, but I am emotionally attracted only towards straight or bisexuals, who are unattainable for me. Sex reassignment operation is not an option for me either as I am six feet tall and have a bulky body, I will look very ugly if I go for it, at least now a lot of gay men find me attractive so I am able to have sex when I want. My family hates the fact that I am a Transgender and they want me to stop talking about it and get married and have children. Due to these reasons I rarely call them and they rarely call me. It has been two years since I last saw my folks. I am the only son and I am expected to carry on the family legacy. I tried to make them understand that the same can be achieved by being very successful in life and leaving your mark on the society so that people remember you for the work you have done, but they have different concepts altogether. I have very few friends who are more of acquaintances as they constantly doubt that I am hiding something from them, which obviously I have to. I think about doing MS, but I am afraid what if that life doesn't suit, what if the conditions are same in USA too. I don't know how the life there in USA is for people like us, I have read and researched a lot about it, seems like the kind of life I want. I would like to ask if anyone of you has any first hand experience as to how it is like being Indian and closeted Transgender in USA. It will help me decide whether or not I should take this gamble. </p>
