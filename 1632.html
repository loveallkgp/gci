<p>First of all Abby and Viv... Love u guys .. Y don't u inbox ur address , I will send good chocolates ( seriously not fur name sake)</p>
<p>This is sandy from USA , 29.</p>
<p>This is continuation of #1606. Regarding more sex drive</p>
<p>I had a break up from a 3 month relation almost 4 months ago, only first month is fruitful. The problem he left he can't handle my sexual desire as i used to fuck Atleast 3 times a day. He said if he continue he won't be fit to marry as he is only son. Also he is afraid being gay and he has mood swings if he hangout in public even though we r straight acting. Infact he is little bit feminine in dressing like tight jeans and carrying men's hand bags. I don't hate him becas he has own reasons. I missed him so much till I find a new boy friend last week.</p>
<p>Now all my thoughts are into new guy even though ex comes into mind once in a while. I don't compare but new guy is more matured and admire everything about me. Problem with him is he is doing phd and very busy. I am fine with it. As per my taste I don't like dark skin and taller guys (6.2) and this guys caring over come my tastes.</p>
<p>Now question to all of u guys: I am moulding myself to getting into relation and giving my heart. As u know both has to put effort to get along the relation. I am kind of scared how long will it survive ?? What if new guy will be having different problem after 2 months and leave me. I feel like holding water in hand to carry relation ?? I feel so insecure , not about the guy. He is good so far,,,, some times I feel like luckiest person in the world and next minute I am scared he might leave. I doubt the commitment in gay relations based on my previous relations. Previously few guys played with my heart on the name of relation just to enjoy sex with me and feel my caring ness with out any feelings.</p>
<p>Second thing I kind of hating myself for moving on guys very fast. Now my ex is not comjng into my mind often not that I hate him. We r still casual friends</p>
<p>Love u all 
Sandy</p>
<h1>Viv- Awww, thanks for the thought honey.. you already got the reply to it.  :)</h1>
<p>Now coming to your confession. Insecure thoughts are bound to come in your head. You feel lucky so just live in the present. Don't ponder upon what you might get in future. Nobody has seen it and you cannot live on assumptions. If you are meant to live together, you will live together. If you are meant to be separated, no one can keep you both together. What matters is how you keep the loyalty and trust between the two of you intact. And if you feel that you move on guys very fast then just know that Kim kardashian's one marriage lasted only for 72 hours. You definitely must be better than her. :D</p>
