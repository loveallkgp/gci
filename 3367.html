<p>"When you fall in love everything looks different. You're priority changes from me to us. Than we start taking hasty decisions. Likes one I've done moving in with my bf. My parents know about my sexuality preference. My sister always told me take decisions carefully but I shifted with him. For the past 8 months everything was alright; now everything has changed. He have become like those old couples doing there own things and nothing else. Although I love him very much but sometimes I want to do things that makes me happy like house party with friends. I'm just university student and he is working. But he doesn't allow. Right now I don't know I think our priorities has changed I don't feel the connection. He tends to get irritated really easily but nit bit things which makes me angry. Right now I don't know what to do. I've shifted with my cousins but still my heart is there with him. I miss him what should I do? And it's truly said that don't let ego come between love :(</p>

<h1>gci- Exactly! Never let ego come in your relation. Moving in with each other is a big big step. You are basically entering in each others personal space which some might not like. You should have some understanding before making such big decisions and some ground rules. And if someone does a mistake, discuss it without ego.</h1>
