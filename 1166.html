<p>Hey this is alfaaz from aurangabad maharashtra</p>
<p>my tragedic started when i was in 9th standard , i accepted that i am a gay
mujhe apne bahot se frnzz par crush tha bt
mera ek frnd tha umair tha i started liking him
v used to study together
and masturbate together also
v had sex when v were in 10th
he was top and i was bottom
after 10th hamari life alag huwi
wo nashik padhne chala gaya aur mai pune
wo pure streight tha
bt i am gay
i started missing him
i was just disturbed
i came back to aurangabad and took my education frm my home town
he also came back after two yearz
then 4 yearz humne saath me bitaye
wo mujh ko use karta tha
bt mujhe kahi na kahi lagta tha that he loves me
wo meri bahot respect b karta tha
hum dono besties the</p>
<p>din raat saath me rahete the</p>
<p>hum har cheez share karte the
mai uske pyar me pagal tha
mai kisi b qeemat par use paana chahta tha
i have no words to tell about my love
i sacified alot things for him only
bt use pata nahi tha that i am a gay</p>
<p>one day i told him that
i am a gay
and i love him so much</p>
<p>i was crying that time
usne meri aankho aur maathe par kiss kiya
then bahot passionitly mere saath sex kiya</p>
<p>wo bilkul surprised nahi lag raha tha
after that day wo ek month tak accha raha
lekin usne mujhe ignore karna shuru kar diya
usne phir kabhi mere saath sex nahi kiya
mai use bahot samjhata tha
what happend to him
par wo taalta chala gaya
usne mujhse bilkul baat kam kar di
i attempt sucide just because of him
i lost him for ever</p>
<p>ab 7 months ho gaye humne baat tak nahi ki</p>
<p>i really love him yaar
koi to use samjha do</p>
<p>i need him so badly</p>
<p>maine use kayi baar sorry kaha
aur pichli wali relaionship me laut aane k liye kaha</p>
<p>usne kaha ki mai tere saath normal rahunga bt sex nahi karunga
par mujhe wo pura ka pura waisa hi chahiyye</p>
<p>upar se dekha maine wo ab pahele ki tarha nahi raha</p>
<p>bahot badal gaya hai
meri kya yahi galti hai k maine usse sacchi mahobbat ki
ya mai ek gay hu</p>
<p>plzzzz yaar help me
m dying frm pain</p>
<h1>Viv- Okay, first of all you cannot force love on anyone. Next, you are expecting a bit too much from him. As you said, he is straight(which I doubt) he cannot be in love with you. You both were good and having sex until you came out and professed your love. After that it got awkward for him. This is the mentality of the so called straights. Now listen buddy, he can never love you the way you want him. He can never give you the respect what a partner require. He can never be the ideal partner for you. Its YOU who have to understand that. Find someone who is worthy for your love.</h1>
