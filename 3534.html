<p>hi admin..good work...keep it up. my confession: hi...i am doing my masters from bangalore. i have a huge crush on one of my classmate. he is very good to me and so am i to him. i want him to say that i love him. but im confused about his orientation. he goes out with me on weekends. says that he enjoyes spending time with me. but then sometimes he talks about girls. he doesnot have any gf though. his behaviour is totally confusing. i feel he is straight. and that just becuase im a gay..so may be i suspect or see his all actions from a gay view.. then the other time i feel he is not, and he may be hiding. because he is too shy or conservative to accept it. so, its may be possible that we both may be hiding our orientation from each other. i dont know whether its right or wrong..but i wish he is a gay. coz i seriously love him a lot. this uncertainty is killing me. help..plz give some suggestions.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you could always ask him through your fake profile and then proceed further accordingly. There are an awful lot of closeted gay boys out there. For all you know, he could be.</h1>
