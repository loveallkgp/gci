<p>I am in a relation for 1 yr and I love him very much. Recently he asked me to open a fake Facebook account for him as he doesn't know how to open Facebook account. Now I am observing changes in his behaviour now doesn't spend much time with me and make excuses about work and other personal problems. So I decided to hack his Facebook account and found him having sex chat with other guys and he often meet them without my knowledge. But I didn't tell him anything about this and carried our relationship. Oneday I just casually asked him whether he liked sex chat and hooking up with other guys on Facebook. He completely denied about this and asked me whether I have any suspicion about him or not.I said that I just wanted to know and don't suspect anything about him. I thought that he was doing this just casually but he didn't changed his ways. And now I have enough proof against him to expose him.But I am mentally very disturbed abt this . So dear admin suggest me how should I confront him ?</p>
<h1>GCI- Effing cheaters. Well, there is perfect method to confront him. Open some of his chats and start reading the conversation infront of him. I am damn sure that he will turn pale. If he tries to say anything just hit his nuts and kick him out of your life. DO NOT cry infront of him and make yourself appear weak in any sense. Its his fault, not yours.</h1>
