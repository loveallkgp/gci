<p>Heya to everyone out there!!!
To begin with i am a 20 years old right now and have hooked up with 5-6 men till date.
I am not sexually attracted to girls but at the same time I dont even have any emotional connect to the men with whom I hooked up.
All this is so frustrating.
I really dont want to keep on hooking up so randomly without having any emotional connect with the person.
Do you have any tips? </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, every person is different and everyone perceives their incidents totally differently. Some people get attached after their sexual incidents, some do not, while some develop their feelings after a certain age. Maybe you have not thought about the possibility of being with someone(be it a girl or a boy or someone non binary).</h1>
<p>Having a hookup is different from going on a date. Hookup is just like fuck and forget. You hardly talk about each other and are more interested in exchanging saliva and doing unsanitary acts. Try going for a date next time without planning to bang the other person where you actually talk. You will notice a difference.</p>
