<p>Despite having a bf right ,I feel very lonely. Never in my entire , I thought I would be here seeking advice from an online page but guess what? here I am  and this is  story. 
It all started in September, dropped me a text on grindr which obviously I ignored for like 10 days or so for i never thought he would be the one and then words were exchanged. one thing led to another and I ended up falling for him . He is very honest and open , he told me everything about his past. He even warned me not to have any expectation out from him, guess I should have listened to him back then. so we made plans for a getaway from Delhi for a day or  which didn't happen and it was me who declined that and he was evasive as well. A day or two passed , i made him watch this short gay film on YouTube - last call. He immediately called . it was 4 in the morning and that movie changed everything. He hopped on the very next bus to here in delhi   and I forgot to tell you where he is from-Delhi. I moved in here for my college and he puts up in Chandigarh currently for his studies- engineer in the making. so I sneaked him into my apartment which I obviously share with my 3 brothers. he  stayed for 3 days  and on the second day he said I love you . he told me he was holding it back this long so that he can say it to me in person and not over the phone. and the  second time ,  he came around was on my birthday. I opened the door and there he was at my  door . He came unannounced. I won't lie that was the best birthday ever. 
 Here I am  now, 3months after this crazy whirlwind relationship   , feeling void.Guys, you know what really sucks? breaking up with the person when you are still in love with the person. we both are in our final year of college. He will leave India ... have already started applying application for universities out there. I  reviewed his applications. He is pretty smart and I know he will get accepted for sure . He has his exam going on at the moment and then on 20 - he has TOEFL exam and on 28-GRE. conversation has run dry ... small talk -work and weather, that's it.  I don't want to lose him yet I don't want him to get distracted but the way we are in right now is killing me. I don't want to give him any Bullshits but I am utterly lonely. Everyone is doing well except for me... friends getting accepted to universities abroad and what not while here I am with no plans at all. I have got no one else to talk to and I don't know why I am even here ? I don't have a question in my mind. I just wanted to talk to someone . Things are coming up ... break up is for certain . I hope he gets selected and pursue his dreams of 'quitting India'- his exact words but my heart belies me. 
Thank you .
regards </p>
