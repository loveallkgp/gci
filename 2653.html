<p>hi frnds.I really need good advice guys from u all. My problem is as follows I am in relationship with a guy for last 4 yrs.We have good understanding and gel very well. I am completely loyal to him since 4 yrs.I have told abt him to my family also.My parents have never accepted him,but i still have made many attempts to make my family accept him.Many ppl in my locality also know abt him now.But the problem is that we dont stay together. During initial stages of ur relationship, i have many a times caught him having sex wd other guys.BUt i made him understand, i wont continue realtionship if such things continue.From last 3 yrs i hv completely trusted him and never made any checks for loyality,just because of my love to him But few days back i somehow came to know,he is still having sex dates with guys. I am completely shocked to know all this.I have loved him so much and have been always suffering so much friction from my family abt accepting him, he is not even loyal to me.May be ,for emotional satisfaction he meet me,and for his physical needs he needs some other ppl. Please help me out. I am in great dilemma.</p>
<h1>GCI- LEAVE HIM! If he can't stay loyal to you, there is no need to be with him. He can't stand to your expectations. How did you even manage to be with him for 4 years despite of knowing that he was cheating on you.</h1>
