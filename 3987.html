<p>Hey there.
i need help. desperately.
i know its not my place to write something or stuff...i dunno.
i just need your advice administrator. u can just msg me back.
okay. so here's the thing.
i am a 21 year old girl and my problem is that since 2-3 years i am confused that i am bisexual. About the boys... i am sure about the boys not just because i am madly in love with one but because i just know. i understand the feeling i get when i am around them.
About the girls... oh damn!! why it had to be about the girls too??
see, i had this really great friend, a girl, and we parted ways due to some stupid unknown reason.. u know the kind of thing when people change when they r far away kinda thing?? i am just not able to move on. I am not a kind of person who likes crying and being stuck at some stupid people fr so long. i mean she is not the first one who parted ways. everyone changes with the time and so does relationships. I am okay with everyone else. but not in her case. none of my present friend understands how can i behave so stupid!! so, anyways, this was when i thought for the first time that what i have for her could be a bit more than just feelings of frindship. i am still not sure about it but then i started noticing my behaviour around the girls. i realized that i do pay attention on girls body and all. Course i always knew that i pay attention but i just thought its normal. i am still not sure that its a bi-thing or not.
i guess i'd like to get a little intimate with a girl..not sex.. i dont want to have sex with anyone right now.. bt a bit intimate. i dunno whether its out of curiosity or something else.
I have only open about my this bi-curious thing to my boyfriend and one other female friend of mine. he is totally understanding about it. he knows that i need to clear this out. being confused about your own orientation... about something a big part of who you are... its frustrating. and i am a kind of person who hates puzzels. i NEED everythng to be clear. Does the everything i said makes me bisexual??? how do i know it for sure.
I wont mind being bisexual, if i am so. i mean, i am what i am. but i need to know who i am.
there is this friend of mine in my hostel who asked me whether she could kiss me once... and just to fulfill my curiosity i didn't denied her. yeah, i dont have so much courage to just directly accept that bt yes, i dint deny. i talked to my bf about it. he said if u really need to try it once then u can, may b that could clear thing out. but the thing is i dont eel attracted to that at all. i dont think, if the kiss by any chance happened, would feel anything to me.. but she might end up having feelings for me. and i know its wrong. oh, dont worry.. she too has a bf but the way she is around me makes me feel that she has some kind of feelings for me and the way she just asked me for the kiss... the kiss might never happen, i dunno... depends on her.
i am extremely sorry for the long text and everything. but i needed to tell you all the side of the story so that, funnily enough, i could ask a stranger to judge me!!
please reply me ASAP.
i dont care if you post it or just reply with a msg... i just need answers... answer to know how to figure out who am i?</p>
<h1>GCI- You have answers in your text only. But even if you want some direction then ask yourself some questions.</h1>
<p>Are you attracted to girls emotionally, romantically and sexually?
What do you see when you look at girls? 
What thoughts you have when you are with a girl?
In the long run, whom you'd prefer to be with if your every fantasy comes true?(Yes I took it from Satyamev Jayate)</p>
<p>You think about it and then you can figure out yourself more. In the same way answer these questions for yourself considering a boy. And please, don't panic.</p>
