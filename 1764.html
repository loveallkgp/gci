<p>I m really depressed..... muje mere type ka koi miltha hi nai hai me kiya karu ... mere sare friends are suggesting me ki it's fine accept people the way they are .. dreaming about being with your dream boy is just a dream no body is perfect .. I understand and I respect them all ... but I just can't love someone who don't deserve me ...
I m not over confident .. even I m single . Even I want a boyfriend , even I wanna fall in love , even I wish to be with someone who Cares for me .. but I need a Man of my own choice .... dude even I feel lonely ... when ever I see couples hand in hand even I feel like walking with my man just the same .... I just need a man who deserves me ..</p>
<p>I can't be in relationship with a driver or a servant or a barber kind of a guy just because he is good-looking .i dont give a damn to looks but .and my ranbir kapoor / aditya roy kapoor is just my fantasy .. i know it can never be my real love story with them ... for me personality matters the alot .</p>
<p>The way you speak , the way you behave , your sophicticasy , your well to do with attitude , your dressing sense ... your mature behaviour , your possessive attitude matters a lot . The way you shake hands . Your professionalism with your caring , protective &amp; possessive behaviour matters the most ....</p>
<p>Even I need love .. even I feel lonely every day .. people comment on me that I m rude , mean , I have too much of attitude etc .. it really hurts .. why don't you guys understand that even I cry and even I feel lonely ... and I just can't be with servant / driver / barber kind of a guy . I respect them all but not for relationship ... I m not rude ... </p>
<h1>Viv- Okay, your preference. Did someone wrong you on your choices? BTW, the thing that attracts you to actors is something they are excelled to present infront of the camera. You don't know what they are like in real life. Don't use comparing methods to look for your love. You will have too much of choices left. And at the same time look at yourself that whether YOU stand on your expectations or not.</h1>
