<p>On a cold winter night we were walking to our hostel from the main gate of the university. We were discussing things about each others life. Suddenly i said "hey i m gay" . His response was surprising and shocking. He said "what difference does it make". I was totally overwhelmed to hear that. Thats when he added " you can count on me like 1 2 3 and i ll be der..."
He is none other than my best friend! He is the first person i came out to, and guys believe me it felt so lighter. He is totally straight, infact he is in a serious relationship with a girl who became a very good friend of mine after he told her about me. And she treats me like her brother.
And its been two years since that incident and our friendship has just got better!
P.S. I said it has just got better, not that it was always better. It went through many ups and downs just because of my stupidity! I ll let you know guys about it the next tym i come here. Till then enjoy the chilly winters!
P.P.S. #admin i have a crush on you for your smartness!!</p>
<h1>GCI- That sounds so cinematic. Hope you both have a nice strong bond in future as well. Thanks for appreciation, darling. :)</h1>
