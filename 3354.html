<p>"So there's this guy I met online on 6th Feb. We started talking and became very good friends. He showed me his real account trusting me and told me not to mention anyone anything about him, not even his name. I promised I wouldn't. He'd said that he is the kind of guy who lives two different lives and there's a fine line separating them and he likes keeping it that way. But he also told me that a few of his best friends know that he's gay.</p>
<p>As time passed, we kept chatting and at a point, we fell for each other. He said that he doesn't wanna go into a relationship and wouldn't have sex due to religious issues. He would stay single and raise his best friend's child in the future or adopt a child. I was okay with all this too. I just wanted his love. I can stay without having sex all my life, and I, personally, am also not interested in sex. Anyways, so things were going good between us until he just disappeared one day without saying anything. He wasn't online for days and I was missing him like anything. My heart was aching and I couldn't take the pain of his absence anymore and I couldn't keep it within me anymore as it was hurting me. So I told a few of my best friends about him.</p>
<p>Then one day I was going through his photos and found a mutual friend. Then I remembered that she'd once told me that she has a best friend who's gay. I realized that she was talking about him. So I shared about my feelings with her and asked her to tell me where he was and how he was doing and why he wasnt coming online.</p>
<p>She told me that he never mentioned anything about me to her ever and she's hurt. She called him and asked, ""How do you know him?""
He replied, ""Stay away from my personal life.""
She hang up instantly, being hurt that her best friend said so.</p>
<p>That very night, he came online after one month and knocked me, because, he wanted to ask me how his best friend got to know about us when I'd promised I wouldn't tell anyone about it. I was so happy to have him back and I wanted to be honest with him. So I told him that how happy I was to have him back and told him that I told my friends about him because it was hurting me all this time that he wasn't there to talk to.</p>
<p>He blocked me after reading my message.</p>
<p>I know I did a mistake by breaking my promise but he should've also tried to understand my situation.</p>
<p>And now, I've asked his best friend to talk to him and to explain to him why I told my friends about him and how guiity I feel now after realizing that I shouldn't have told anyone about him. I also asked her to tell him to forgive me and talk to me so that I can explain myself and get another chance. I really love him and after being blocked by the person I love, I've been feeling very low lately.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you would suggest me to do so that things can go back to normal between us?"</p>
<h1>gci- I don't know why people think so much of useless things in the name of society and religion. It only makes your life harder. They day you decide to not care about it, you would have a free life. I really don't know what that guy wants but be assured that he doesn't want to socialize and want to live a discreet life. Clearly he is still fighting the battle in his head that he wants to stay in the middle because he cant choose the either side. If possible you can ease it for him.</h1>
