<p>Hello, I had a huge crush on a guy from college later he happened to be my best friend. We are of completely different types, he was into sports and socialising with a very large grp of frnds, while I'm studious and introvert not even having a couple of good frnds. but he used to respect me so much and we both cherished our friendship. At the end of college we were drunk and kissed each other and he even allowed me to blow him. But the next day he acted like he remembered nothing, I tried to make him talk abt it, he said I don't remember anything u too forget it if it really happened. I didn't mind I let it go, but he's keeping distance now. He later left and now he's in other city. He never tried to contact me and he is not interested to talk even when I call but he texts and flirts and shares his hot pics with me whenever he's drunk. What does that even mean, I'm enjoying it though but still I wanted him to be in a proper relationship with me, is it anyway possible..</p>
<h1>GCI- Girl, no. Find someone who doesn't uses your mouth for his drunken pleasures. There are good guys out there. I'd leave his sorry ass be.</h1>
