<p>Well all of you now know that tim cook is gay but perhaps what you all don't now that his sexuality was an open secret. His friends and media were aware of it. When an individual has not exactly come out, the media usually refrains itself from explicitly mentioning it.
Now in this link i am posting (regarding the latest coming out of tim cook), It has been said that ATLEAST two chief ministers of India are supposed to be (or rumored to be) gay along with some notable public personalities. Who these might be? any guesses. I would love to hear. Since there is always a smoke when there is a fire.
There must be certain individuals who are understood to be gay after all, but common decency and respect of privacy prevents the media or people to mention it.</p>
