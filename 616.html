<p>(MY FIRST METRO EXP):
Sahil..age 21..(Delhi)
Here it goes..
today i bored from Rajiv chwk metro stn at 6.15pm in last
compartment..
there was a guy standing beside me of age 17-18 and he was
with another guy of age 27-28... the teen guy was very cute
and sweet .. even he was not having mustache yet..he was in
blue shirt and was looking pretty..
i stand beside him and he was having back side towards
me..his 1 hand was near his back pocket so i try to roll my
fingers on his hand..
he also was holding my fingers slightly and was not making
any other move..after some time i got a call and i got busy
on call meanwhile he was trying to rub my dick and i was
enjoying it..he also mummers something in his friend's ear..i
think he told him about me.. then again he came back and he
was enjoying holding my dick and i was enjoying his
presence with me..
i really want to ask him about his contact no but was afraid
and was shivering a bit bcz it was my first public place exp.
Then the worst part came..he move towards door and give a
cute smile to me,then debord at Janak puri east..it was really
a sad moment for me bcz i like that guy and was aware that
we are not gona meet again..
i wana say if you are reading this confession plzz inbox me
or comment here..
Rest for all readers have nice day,stay blessed and be safe.</p>
<h1>ABBY : u let him rub ur penis ... and was to shy to ask for no /... say what &gt;&gt;&gt; :/ .. if was at ur place i would have given my no first ... if positive response comes from sopmbody i like .</h1>
