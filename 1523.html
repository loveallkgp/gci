<p>Hi. I am soft natured guy and too down to earth. And this character of mine is even though appreciated, but it has been taken as granted by many. :( In school days everyone used to tease me a lot. I was the epicenter of fun to all. Even my best buddies used to join hands with others and used to simply hurt my feelings. :( But gals used to like my soft nature ( inspite of few gals teasing me like u r like our younger sister for all gals and blah blah). I used to be with gals many a time. Might be being with dem almost all my school days, has influenced me to be slightly soft spoken in nature :(. This makes me afraid of being interactive in class. I feel frightened to speak with others coz dey may tease me for my soft spoken attitude.( coz people normal notion is a guy shuld be rough and gal shuld be soft). So many a times i wil be silent in class. But i love to care everyone in class. My caring nature has made me too lovable person in class. But still all tease me. :( Everyone comes and hug me. Der are no gals in my present class , and therefore most of my classmates consider me as gal of class :( Few even kiss me. I stay in Boys hostel. There everyone knows tat i can be made a tool for der fun, entertainment and time pass and they do the same.:( Wen i get upset or anger, they console me by being emotional or sometimes kiss me on my cheeks and then i wil melted and back to normal sensitive emotional soft guy :( Few will be giving flying kisses wen dey see me. many have said tat if dey were gay then dey would hav fucked me . Some say they wished to get a girl friend like me. And few say if i would have been a girl den dey would have proposed me. :) Even i have got few funny time pass proposals by straight guys. But all these happenings make me even still weaker. Watever they do dey finally end in teasing and making fun of me all the time. :( I always wish tat all d people who care me in a funny way to be gays. Coz i take all there silly activities seriously . All there behaviour triggers my gay feelings even more. I keep suppressing my gay attitude and feelings but all these HUGS, KISSES, PROPOSALS by boys make me to be more closer to straight guys and love dem even though i know i cant get straight guys as my prince :( This makes me to be more sensitive and emotional which i dont want. On the other hand i dont want to hurt them by being rude with dem (even though its nearly impossible for me to be rude). Sometimes i think atleast nw i am getting Funny love + teasing; If i say tat i am gay, den they would surely stop showing der funny love and i will get more intense teasing and humiliation. I am confused. I want to be rough. I dont want anyone to take me as granted. I dont want anyone to tease me anymore. :( :( Guys pls help me how to change my nature and be strong , rough like straight guys ? </p>
<h1>Viv- Listen honey, you are just tooooo much sweet with everyone. There is nothing wrong with that because it is really positive on a big scale but sometimes you have to be selfish for your own mental health. Your mental health is kind of deteriorating and you have to get it back together. Just take a stand for yourself whenever necessary. You are also a human being and not a tool of their teasing or their entertainment. Also, it appears to me that you sometimes enjoy the attention you get. First of all, stop thinking like you will get love from these guys. Next, tell them to stop their intimate activities and to behave normally with you like any other person. And lastly, start loving yourself than expecting someone to love you. This will make you strong.</h1>
