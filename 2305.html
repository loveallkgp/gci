<p>Hello admin,I m totaly new in this lage,I have one confusion....i m 21yr,and 2 years ago ,I met to unknown guy ,we met at my home .we were going very nicely wkth talks,we became good to each other that day itself.slowly slowly I fall in love with him,but he dint,he was saying that dont fall in this gay world,he said he lv me but he dont want that I go in this gay world,he was also gay...i had praposed him 4-5times in a year.till time I never contacted with any gay....now I realise that he has no feeling and now he wont come n say that he love me and je wont come back...what you think...i should leave the past ,....?and should go ahead?or???</p>
<h1>GCI- of course you should leave the past. The person who is not ready to accept himself can never be with you for a long time. One day or the other you will have the breakup and you will end up in the pool of tears and the weight of stress if you ever get together. Well, just so you know, there is nothing like "falling" in the gay world. Straights don't fall in their straight world, do they?</h1>
