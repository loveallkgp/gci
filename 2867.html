<p>Hi #Viv &amp; #Abby Hope you both are doing well! God bless &amp; Good day! Recently I could see that people criticizes the admins for various reasons like language biased, offending comments, attitude related, etc. When I see such posts, I could remember the saying "You are proceeding high &amp; in right way, when people starts talking about you" As you are, be cool and never give a crap to such people. But sure, give them the middle finger so that they will know what they have to do.. You're doing really a good work and you're on the same track since you started this page. Also, I had a question to ask you.. Where is the "dude" guy..? I'm missing his comments these days</p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks honey.. we always speak whats in out mind and can't fool people with super sweet words and fake things like some politicians. At the end we can't make everyone happy.</h1>
<p>As for the dude guy, damn I don't know where he went.</p>
