<p>Hello everyone, this is neither a confession nor is it about anything gay. Just a request from me.</p>
<p>Please wear a helmet when you ride a two wheeler. It really does save lives. I had an accident last month and was saved from serious injury only because of my helmet. Unfortunately my friend's friend was not so lucky. He died of severe head injuries last night. Yes, he wasn't wearing a helmet. Don't just put it on, please buckle the strap too. I've heard ridiculous excuses from people- it messes up my hair, I sweat a lot, etc. If you don't have a head or a life where does all this matter?? Ride safe!!</p>
<h1>GCI- I am sorry to hear about your friend. May he rest in peace.</h1>
<p>He says the truth guys. A son of my dad's friend had an accident once and he got a head injury. He went into coma for a few days but when he woke up, he had memory loss which was permanent. So, for your own safety, wear a helmet.</p>
