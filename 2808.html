<p>I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU ALL GIVE TIME AND READ THIS AND DO COMMENT ON THIS WILL BE VERY THANKFUL</p>
<p>Everyone present here have something in their mind.
I appreciate everything.
However sometimes I feel some people here start behaving like a Non-Human being. I don't know why they start doing so.</p>
<p>I feel sometime this life process works on many scientific principles and one of them is EVERY ACTION HAS EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION (Of-course the NEWTON's law) ; I feel like in life if we ll hate someone he will hate us, if we ll kick someone he ll kick us, if we will be angry to someone he will be angry to us.</p>
<p>Then why when we are polite to someone they always act like non-human, why they want just a thing SEX even if you want him to be a good friend or may be more than that?</p>
<p>Yeah sex is a need but its a need for heterosexuals too; then why only we homosexuals get this worse just for only one thing that is SEX?</p>
<p>I feel that the reason behind the Image which we have in the eyes of all the heterosexual, We are the biggest reason for it. The way we act gives them the chance to speak bad about us (As this is a normal human nature that people stick to your bad things rather than looking at your good things).
and obviously a heterosexual guy think that we are just a thing to have SEX with and the reason behind it is only 'WE'.</p>
<p>Don't you guys feel that we should act like human beings?
So that heterosexual should come to know that we are HUMAN BEINGS.</p>
<p>We always want that we should have a good RESPECT in this society(I hope we all want that), however are we creating the scenario to be respected?
Fighting with each other, abusing sexually, looking for just sex(Some straights misuse this thing) etc. does these things really made us to be RESPECTED?</p>
<p>I want us to change our thinking. I am not pointing everyone here. Even I too have got a bunch of friends who are real and want good friends not just SEX.</p>
<p>So as Mahatma Gandhi ji said BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD.
So we have to start with us only.
We have to make others respect us as no one respect animals who are having sex and barking over the streets (I apologize if someone feels like I am disrespecting them but my motive is not that), don't you feel when you ask for random sex and fight with each other it feels the same as animals??</p>
<p>I just want that like heterosexuals we should have a healthy social life like Human beings not like Non- Human kind.
and then with that we will become a big family with good bonding with each other and then we can easily fight for out right(when we will stop fighting with each other).
Just a normal human being
Thank you and Respect to all.
Edward Knights</p>
