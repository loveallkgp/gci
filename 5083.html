<p>Hey this is Howard-
I am 19, and I am a Bisexual,
I wanna confess a few things about me, so that u guys know me better, though I have never found anyone who is as practical in life as me, I am the king of practicality lol :)</p>
<p>a) I choose to be in closet for the very important reason that I don't need anyone to accept me, and anyways even if I come out and tell my friends/family, nothing good is gonna come out of it because Indian people are not mature enough to understand(no matter how rich they are), it will just make things awkward for me as well as for them, anyways whenever I go abroad for vacations/study, I don't hide and I will never hide :)</p>
<p>b) Even in India, its not like I hold myself back, I do whatever a gay boy my age would do, We only have 70-80 yrs to live, and I wanna live them on my terms, If you understand and support me- good, if not- I don't even have time to care :)</p>
<p>c) I don't believe in god/religion/caste/rituals etc they make me sick to the stomach, but I can suerly watch them with my mouth shut :)</p>
<p>d) I don't like my country, I almost hate it, with all due respect to the national freedom fighters, they can't change the mentality of people, Its still too retarded, and every country has its freedom fighters, doesn't mean its is better than other, I know many of you are patriots, but sorry Im not, and cant do anything about it, that is who I am :)</p>
<p>e) yep I got a boyfriend, hes 16 tho and Dutch :) we meet rarely tho</p>
<p>I wish I could have some1 to talk about all this here in India, unfortunately theres no one, sufficient to say, its boring lol</p>
<p>and watch Shameless if you havent watched already :) -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_oaD_Sfmzw</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh I love shameless and I love Ian and Mickey's love story. Mickey was a darling by the end of 4th season and I was like "awwwwww.... Mickey... you are so sweet!"</h1>
