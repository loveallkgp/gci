<p>Hy, Im Bhutani currently enrolled in paramedical course in Banglore. Im straight in apperance but internaly Gay. No doubt.</p>
<p>Here Transgender are freely asking money with men, if men refuses, they usese vulgur abusive words with ugly expression. This might be a common to this locality, however it seems more disguesting to us who are from foreign. Even in train while traveling to native/native to India, Bhabi Log(Transgenders) they makes too much irritation. My few frnds said they are compelled to do these daily activity bcz they dont have job, hence for shake of first basic need i.e food they are involvining in.</p>
<p>India has very good image in Globe. recently PM have made more strong bond with overseas. It would be the great if India government/INGO makes n implements a policy to ensure transgender future.</p>
<p>Apart from this, i heard kaisi ye yarian is partly related to homosexual life. can any buddy put link of kaisi ye yarain in comment??</p>
<p>Thank u for attention</p>
<h1>GCI- See, they don't have a proper place to live even. Just a few months ago they got their status as the third gender and got all the rights to study and do a job. The conditions will not improve suddenly. Many are illiterate and don't even have a basic elementary knowledge. For the basic requirement of food, you have to do something. They have to spread their hands and beg for money from those people who look at them differently, who laugh at them, who abuse them, sometimes rape them, and still they go into that society and again spread their hands. Whenever you see someone, give them a few bucks. Honestly, it really isn't a big deal.</h1>
