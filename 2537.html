<h1>GCI- Well if your family knows as well and they are proud of you then I guess no one can say anything against you. If I was in the same condition, I'm pretty much sure that my sis would have said, "I want a guy who will accept my brother as he is." Same thought can be used by your sister. If your family doesn't know then there is no hurry to tell them at all. And please, don't get carried away only by the words of your friends. As your friends they should support you in every condition and not make you feel low.</h1>
