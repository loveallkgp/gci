<p>HI Guys. I am in relationship in guy for last 3 yrs. we love each other a lot. I am completely loyal to him and expect the same from him.He has confessed twice to me ,because of guilt ,that he had sex with some other guys during initial stages of our relationship.I really liked his honesty and still continued our relationship with him. I have build lots of trust on him ,so i have never monitored him.But few days ago, some how i saw messages in his phone about meeting with some guy at public place.He never told me about his meeting this guy to me.When i questioned him abt these messages.he got very angry with me for doubting his loyalty and love to me,He gave me argument, he wants his space and cant keep on telling each and everything abt his life to me. He convinced me he never had any sex with this guy he met and suggests me to trust him ,and dont spy on him and not to invade his personal space. He has always told me that he needs his personal space Guys pls help me out!!!!! Am i being too much possessive or taking his personal space off .Do i dont need to know each and every thing he is doing in his life ,being his life .partner?. How should i define when i am taking away his personal space from him ?</p>
<h1>GCI- True that everyone needs a personal space and no one should really interfere in it. You are being a bit too much possessive here. There has to be a sort of manner in which you should ask stuff from him. If you are angry and then ask the argument is gonna spring up but if you ask calmly then you can have a normal conversation as well. But also, to keep the mutual trust between the two of you, he also should open up with all of his daily activity. There shouldn't be much secrets between life partners except their last will and testaments. So you be the sane one and make him realize the importance of communication.</h1>
