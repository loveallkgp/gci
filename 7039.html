<p>What should I start with? I have been so superficial/fake throughout my life. Trying hard to behave like a straight, trying to have manly features. Well I am being good enough to fool people but i feel like fooling myself all the time. These straight norms and values I cannot follow. They don'tet me feel who I really am. May be I am suffering from identity crisis, may be from depression. Why this society/world seems so strange to me. They say I am a criminal for being me. But don't think anyone in this world wants to be the minority isn't it?
Alas.. this life is so pathetic. Better I die, I think sometimes but again no one wants to be called a loser. Everyone wants to be someone, everyone wants to be loved. Of course people love me but again that's so ironic, they don't love me for who I am but for who I am trying to be(a pretending straight). Trying to be them makes me depressed. Yes I suffer from severe depression, I suffer from identity crisis. Depressed life. Depressed gay (criminal) life in India.</p>
