<p>19 bangalore</p>
<p>Guyzz PLEASE help. Today my laptop got stolen from my pg. It had nearly 50k photos of all the places I visited! Nearly 10k songs and innumerable movies I collected all my memories and collection are now gone! Those were invaluable bt apart from these, it also had important documents, softwares, two operating systems! Im absolutely numb and dead now</p>
<p>The problem doesn't end here! It had gay porn and several pics of me and my buffie, photos of us and our love letters, some crazy intimate videos(not sex, bt intimate). I am worried as fuck what wud happen to these? Though they are protected by Bitlocker, im sure the thief would in no time, unlock those! What if it goes viral? These things are worrying me soo much! Im having goosegumps, anticipating the outcome. Mom ko bola, bt she scolded me soo much! Bt usko bol ni paunga bohot darr lag raha h! Adding salt to injury, now gayism is ILLEGAL in India. So in a way I hav evidences of myself doing illegal activity! Blackmailing ka darr and viral hone ka darr even I dont hav the MAC and IP address to track it! In a nutshell Im finished</p>
<p>do u guys have any ray of hope that can provide solace to this litte ill-fortunate soul? </p>
<h1>GCI- First of all calm down. The condition is not that bad as you are imagining. The thieves never look for the material in the drives. They can always format it. All they look for is money when they sell it. So, targeting you will be the last option for the one who stole your laptop. You can calm down on that.</h1>
<p>I know it is out of the context but being gay is NOT ILLEGAL. Its the sexual act that is illegal. So again, you can calm down on that. </p>
<p>And what activities you did which is illegal? Did you make videos of yourself having sex? If not, again you can calm down on that. No one can blackmail you on mere suspicion.</p>
