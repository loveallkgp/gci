<p>Admin ..need of your  words again ... .....</p>
<p>i chatted with a guy for around a week ...we kinda became close ... He was good n sweet  ....may be it was infatuation or love or something ...i kinda felt for him ..... N one day  while chatting we wer kinda getting close n he told me that we should not get emotionally attached to each other at  this  time ...he told that its gonna hurt us both .... I felt bad so directly i told him that we should not keep in touch anymore ...... It hurts to wait for that persons message whole day . I just bid him goodbye ...n now m missing him badly ..,was it my fault ???</p>
<h1>GCI- Yes, a bit of it was your fault. Emotional attachment should not happen this early. You should take time for it. Like at least 2 months or so. When you really feel that that person is the one for you, then you should take step ahead. He was being mature as far as I got to know from your confession.</h1>
