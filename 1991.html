<p>what am i doing now? sitting in my lab, trying to operate a closed loop temperature control system, listening to tu hi re from Bombay and reading confession of this page. Life is strange. It gives us so many pains. Only a few of us have the strength to accept our shortcomings and still not grudge about them. It requires strength to be gay, to be different. It requires strength to face mockery from friends and family; to bear torture and life seems a living hell. suicide? o hell, i have given it a thought many a times but then i thought, if this is the single life i have ever got to live, why only focus n my sexuality, why not thank Him for the brains he has given me or the educations, the other privileges of a good life he has given me, or good parents he has given me? Everyone, your sexuality is not your sole identity, it's just a small pixel of a bigger picture</p>
<h1>GCI- It really does not matter until someone is saying something against your rights. Otherwise its not something to think upon 24x7.</h1>
