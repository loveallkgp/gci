<p>Hey admin m getting fear to have sex these days, I use condoms whenever I have sex and I used branded like moods n durex ultra thin condoms but it gets tear when I pull out my dick after ejaculation which I ejaculated inside rectum of random guys it happens most of time........... I don't no what to do, any sugestions</p>
<h1>GCI : we had talked on these issues back on our page and maybe our old readers remember this   but as new readers have come we will surely again post information on it .</h1>
<p>condom breaks for many reasons </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>you are not putting it right . make sure you nails are totally trimmed and when you hold the condom hold it with your fingers and not nails. don't forcefully put the condom and make sure you remove the air .
every condom box has 'using instructions' on it . so see the instruction .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>don't use oil, vaseline , cream or any other stuff on condom while sex ( most men do bot bottoms and tops they oil their parts up which is wrong) . use sex lubricants which you can get either online or on the medical store.<br>
oils , vaselines , creams extra make latex or rubber condoms hard and they break after few thursts . </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whenever you feel that condom is broken immediately  pull your penis out . remove the broken condom . wash your penis and also tell the bottom to wash his parts with water and soap . now use a new condom again . ( durex has 3 condoms in one box) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometime when you wear the condoms , sometimes it comes out . don't use it if it comes out instead use new one. 
make sure the body fluids ( semen or precum ) has not contaminated the outside of condoms . if so use new one otherwise no use of wearing condoms .</p>
</li>
</ol>
