<p>I'm the unlucky confessor
guys we started on 09th may n ended up on 5th July just 2days before my bday.
I'm in love with my lucky charm bf who is from Kerala. I loved him like a hell.
But we were in ldr(long distance relationship).
I used to talk to him every time when ever he or me is free.
we used to video calls.
Everything was going smoothly n nicely.
We were in endless love with each other.
Worst time of my life started when he left for Chennai for her mom's surgery. As I'm a medical student i make him comfort. But as he was giving his time to his mom i was lil bit sad that my hubby is not giving time to me.
one day i met a guy from fb. we had a conversation on ldr he said that it is not so successful but all the time i said no it cam be lived easily when u are loyal.
He called me for hangout. As i was free i went to meet him. He is soft by his heart when i met him. we roam around his home. now we went to his home n again he took that non sense talk about ldr. we had a long argument. when i saw the time it was 8:30 pm i asked him that may i able to sleep at his home as my hostel don't allow me to enter so late in campus.
Now the evil character of this person starts now.
He came closer to my face talking about my physics n kissed me on my neck n cheeks. n started his ldr story that how he was cursed in ldr.
I was so emotionally weak at that time.
He kissed me on my lips saying that he like me n started loving me
But i told him that I'm committed n i can't cheat on my bf.
He is a cleaver fox he trapped me some how in his plan. N he got intimated with me at that night.
I was hell for the very first time i loosed my virginity with a guy who is not a good guy.
Very next morning he said that he loves me a lot n will accept me as his bf if i do not breakup with my bf.
But i said no i can't do that.
Guys u know what he is a sex seeker n money seeker. As I've tested him later on.
He told me not to say anything with my bf. But after 2 days i told everything my bf.
At that time he was normal in talk n said he need time to forget this. I said its okay if u breakup i must meet curse to my sin.
slowly slowly he started to ignore me.......
n finally now he don't even pick up my calls n don't even reply back to them.
I was feeling guilty on me that's why i told him all the shit which already happened with me.
The main problem is my bf left me when i need his support n when i needed him a lot.
I just can't able to study. My all lectures are just missing I was present in my lectures but physically not mentally. I told my besties of my college who knows about my sexuality.
They have said to give his no to them they will talk to him. But i did not give. As i didn't know what will be the reaction of it.
Although my 1st year has got ruined just bcz of my breakup n some family reason.
Now I'm up to end my life.
I'm dropping myself in call center. I'll start earning.
Well benefit of this incidence is I met some of really supportive n good frnds from this fake book(fb)
I need ur strong n enthusiastic suggestions my dear admin n my dear readers.</p>
<p>I KNOW IT WAS SUCH A LONG STORY BUT PLEASE READ IT WITH UR HEART NOT WITH UR MIND.
N SUGGEST ME WHT SHLD I DO NOW??????
waiting for ur strong reply abby &amp; viv.</p>
<h1>GCI- Don't just lower your guard so easily next time. That guy easily manipulated you into having sex with you. I do not blame your bf because according to me cheating is something which can't be forgiven. The only benefit you could have from this incident is that learn to be strong and loyal even if 10 dicks are staring at you right in the face at sometime.</h1>
