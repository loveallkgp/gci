<p>When I wasn't aware about my gender identity. I considered myself as a effeminate gay boy.I was in madly love with a boy .He was my classmate.It was like a love story ,my love story ..Ek sath ghumna,logo se chup chup k kiss karna,ek straw pe pepsi pena ..you know how it is..He called me  wife and for my best friend "Sali"...when he was 17, he got job in Army and left for Banglore..hum duriyon ko kam karne k liye Ghanto phone p baat karte the..4 or 5hours maybe..phir dhire dhire phone kam howa ...5ghante se 10minutes...if I asked, "busy hu sona"he replied ..I was too upset and frustrated for that  ..jhagra suru kar diya..He started to avoid me..15din 16din phone nehi ata tha ..if I asked he said because mein jhagra karti hu....in 4or 5months usne muje apni zindegi se bahar kar diya..Na phone.,na kuch, ghar p jab ata tha amne samne hone se munh pher leta tha..That pain was really heavier for me..so I attempted my first sucide.. ..he was world to me...because of his hatred I started self hurting like cutting my leg with blade,hitting my head with walls..that seems psycho..but that pain was really heavy..I still believe that one day he will return ..that's why I check my mobile daily, is there any message or call from him..no call or message ..I tried to communicate him so many times.He cut my phone everytime...no i am wrong he picked up one time and said"abay sale tu bol kon raha hein"..that was his last word...</p>
<p>$ABBY : see  i don't know what happened to him what has changed him .. but when people reach certain age they change . as he has grown up now he knows people will ask questions . and you haven't mentioned if he was gay or bi man . whatever reasons are just move on and find yourself somebody worthy .don't hurt yourself . that's all i can say</p>
