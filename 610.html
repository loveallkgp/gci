<p>hey guys.....read most of d confessions over here.....n i must say u ppl rock....i wud like to thank d admins frm d bottom of my heart for providing us a platform where we can talk our hearts out....
i m in clg, 3rd year.....wen i was in 2nd year, i had crush on my 4th year senior....he was d real prince charming any bot can think of....at d starting of my clg, wen i was in 1st year....i used to hate him...but i dunno wat hppnd to me...n wat made me fall for him....i told him abt my feelings....v went on a movie date also....but he said tht he will never be able to reciprocate the feeling as he was straight....n i had to accept d bitter truth.....
but i liked him as he was honest n caring....at least he didnt make fun of me...n tried to make me feel happy as much as he could within his limits.....frm tht onwards i started respecting him.....so....every straight guy is not a bad ass or a fun maker.....there r some sensible guys too....
cheers guyzzzzz.....tc...:)</p>
<p>$ABBY : well exceptions are always there ... and i know some str8 guys who are really realy nice by nature . gentleman types .</p>
