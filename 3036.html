<p>one of my gay friends was going through some financial problems, so he decided to start charging money for sex. but he is not good at cracking any deal and also doesn't speak english.
as he asked me i helped him to make some thousands from one person, which he was not expecting. after that i helped him to get few customers. I just talk to them and finalize the amount, he goes, have sex and brings money. But i don't take a single penny from it and i am not interested also. but he has asked me several times to take 20-30 % of share. when 2 -3 of our friends came to know about him, they are calling him cheap and all those craps, but regularly they demand treat from him</p>
<p>i don't understand how it is cheap ? why there is stigma attached to commercial sex workers? they are charging from the persons who are willing to pay, they don't extort money from anyone.</p>
<p>and i consider what i have done its not a sin, i have just helped a friend. isn't it?</p>
<h1>GCI- Its all personal decision of your friend and if he is an adult then legally there is no problem in it. After all individual prostitution is legalized in India. And as for those friends ask your friend to stop giving them treats if they don't behave nicely. The stigma to the prostitution is not only in India but it is also in the western countries. Though in the west it is looked as an equal status job but still there is some stigma. And it will be there because people like to be moral police for others. The best you can do is to ignore such people.</h1>
