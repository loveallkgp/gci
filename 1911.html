<p>Same guy as confession no.1902..I am really happy to see many positive comments and feedback on my confession...considering the current homophobic law in india and misogynistic attitude of majority of straight and some closeted gays n bi people,I always wanted to do something for my lovely lgbtqi people including myself and I urge whoever are in a position to help others plz just do it..we have a long way to go but if we start now it will end(@goal) someday...keeping aside my motivational words...I would like to open up more about myself....I HV come out to all my close friends who matters to me,they are really very understanding..nothing has changed..lucky to have such friends..but I am yet to come out to my family...it feels so bad not able to tell the truth to my family, I have enough knowledge about lgbt regarding scientific and social point of view, and I know that there is nothing wrong and I can justify it easily be it scientific, social, cultural or religion but only if they are ready to listen to me which I know they will so I am hoping they will somehow be convinced..sometime I thought of telling in the phone but I HV decided I ll tell them only when they ask or insist me to get married...cont. of my story...when I was going through a lonely time I used to browse this website okcupid.com and badly wanted someone to warm me up..that's is when I met my bf..we exchanged numbers and chatted everyday through phone for a month and then we decided to meet...he ask me to come to his house which is in a different city, he said he will tell his family that I m his friend..so I went to his house and stayed together for 4 days in one room..but unlike the typicall gay hookups on first meeting..we did only kissing only..nothing more than that..oh yeah that time was magical..I felt high with the love and care he gave me.we HV been in relationship for 3 years by now..that made me much easier to get over my crush on my best friend..now my best is with a girl he likes from our same batch..a year ago my bf surprised me with cakes and gift on my birthday , ,since he lives in different city and I had my final yr exam he had to contact this same best friend of mine and plan the surprise...oh man,felt kinda awkward...but lovely gesture, isn't it...rt now i am planing to do pg in the same city he lives,lastly ,thank you all for the good wishes....hope nobody gets toxic dose of my confession story..:)</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh my GAWD! I sure as hell am gonna get sugar crystals formed in my head cuz your confession was so damn sweet! All the best for your coming out and may both of you have have a nice future. :)</h1>
