<p>NEVER FALL FOR STRAIGHT GUYS. hi friends. What happend to you guys? why are you falling for straight guys? Most of the gays are saying that they are having a STRAIGHT BEST FRIEND !! Straight guys are never your best friends. Its just your attraction towards them thats why you think they are your best friends. If you really wants to know weather they are your best friends or not then just go and open up to them(NEVER TRY THIS!!). If they accept you as a gay then only you can say that he is your best friend. Otherwise its just your illusion about them. It will hurt to you only. There are lot of gay people who needs love and doesn't open up because of hesitation and fear, Get them and they will be your best friends forever. Stay away from STRAIGHT GUYS. Its never going to work. mind it. harsh truth !!</p>
