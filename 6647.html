<p>hello guys ..
I love a guy more than my life . I am loving him from last year bt he is still attached with his past . he showed his feelings towards me many times bt whenever i ask him for relationship he totally denied it . i have no problem if he is still attached with his past bt he must not confuse me with his confusion in feelings towards me and  because of this i was hang on in this complicated love story from last year which severely took me to depression , affected my health .. 
I moved on many a times but everytime he jumped on me with those words of feelings n took me to the vulnerable situation which broke down me to tears every time because of no acceptance of me . he might b feeling fr me but he is still in his past ..now i have maintained proper distance from so that i dnt get hurt ..I will talk with him bt not now  after 6 months or 1 year only .
whether i should  not maintain distance as i can make him to grow in love with me ??
bt some where i have waited fr too long n because of his confusion i got hurt many times ...
as a person he is very gud bt in love way he unknowingly hurt me a lot.<br>
i am. literally in pieces ..</p>
<h1>GCI- Sorry for being blunt but let me jot down and break it into pieces.</h1>
<p>1- Your friend is NOT a case to be fixed, and u r NOT his therapist.
2- The mentality of consumerism inside our psyche makes us choose and keep someone hanging at the same time for other options thus creating the crack.
3- Your friend has turned into an all consuming asshole who feels to be with someone on just a superficial level because committing again for persons like him means the person should act according to their whims for an uncertain period of time.
4- He has chosen 2 remain a stranger and will continue till he really plunges into U and tries to know ur soul.
5- A strong relationship involves people with self assurance and a willingness to carve out their own new path mutually.
6- He is psychologically abusing you because he is BLIND towards it and u r getting damaged and have got much shattered.
7- It's NOT ur responsibility to save him all the time bcoz sabotaging people harm themselves no matter what we do for them.
8- He has confirmed into believing that he is 'broken' and that is preventing him from getting emotionally attached 2 u. He is still looking for that benchmark of his invested emotions and not creating a new one with U.
9- U r getting emotionally drained because he is not able to invest the same kind and amount of emotions u r doing.
10- Be with someone whom we can like under all circumstances(including disliking some of their traits).
11- If he doesn't choose to know u or your love the chances are that you have 2 leave him forever.</p>
<p>P.S- The basis of love should be a little more firmer and stronger than masochistic and circumstantial co-depedency.</p>
