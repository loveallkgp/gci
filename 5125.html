<p>Has anyone of you guys ever hated yourself for being gay? Well, I have. Everyday since I realized that there's something different about me, and not in a good way. I prayed a lot, God knows how many times. I consulted a psychiatrist when I was a teenager. Psychologist when I was in my late twenties. I am going to turn 30 next month. I am still not okay with my sexuality. I have seen few psychologists. They are saying that I should try to acknowledge my sexuality. But I am not ready to accept that I am gay. They ask me to do a lot of stuff and I never done anything they say. I can't talk to anyone about this, let alone ask some one for help.
I want to happy married life. Always dreamed of that. A wife, two kids, small house. I know that there isn't a cure for it. All of you guys say that it's not a disease but for me it is. If I can't feel comfortable in my skin then what can I do?
It's not that I never tried to be having gay friends. I tried but mostly , with guys, it's very shallow. Nothing deep, so far, has occurred. I met a lot of guys online who wrote thousands of things about bonding and love and companionship yet no one actually was able to commit t one. Some guys would ask if I am top or bot in first few messages itself.
I have been with girls as well. They are what I want for emotional bonding, so deep and really caring. But, my destiny has set another path for me. My brain finds a male body far more beautiful than a female one. Really hard.
I can't be a celibate with so many crazy ideas in my head.
Am out of options. What do you think? A bullet to the brain (just kidding)..... lol </p>
<h1>GCI- You are like this because you never really thought about being okay with yourself. Acceptance is the first step to feel peaceful. If you continuously try to be someone that you are not, your mind will never be at peace. It's not even a disease for yourself. YOU and you alone made it a disease. You mental doom is a result of your own mindset. Only you can make a change to it. No one else can do it for you.</h1>
<p>As far as shallowness is concerned, yes gay community has a lot of shallow people. But I don't feel like saying it everytime. If you don't like such people then let them be. They are not harming you at all. Maybe you haven't find the right person yet. And do know this for a fact that shallow people are everywhere and not just in gay people. Have a good and rational life.</p>
