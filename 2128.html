<p>Well.. I am a professional degree holder... But sexually gay.. And work with an MNC.. Few months back.. My ED had come frm overseas office and i lured into him.. He promoted me twice in a span of few months.. And called me to NY office for training.. I was so engrossed into pay promotion n place.. That i really dint mind sharing bed n serving him.. Few weeks later i realized the sin attached.. And tried retaliating.. Boss understood what on my mind was going.. He immediately sent me back to India.. I kept this fact to myself as a secret.. N1 day.. Out of no where my dad slapped me hard.. N showed me few pics that had me n my boss in intimate moments.. I committed sucide.. But got saved.. Hv been forced to got engaged to a girl who i am nt really interested in.. Dont know how to save myself</p>
<h1>GCI- The sentence "committed suicide" gave me goosebumps. I thought this confession was by a ghost. Damn. I won't go into the assumption like "should have done or would have done". it has all happened and you cannot change it. From the next time, even if you want to retaliate to something, do so nicely that other person shouldn't feel bad and he shouldn't blackmail you like your boss did. Now the truth is out infront your parents, I guess you should tell them that you can't be with a girl and being engaged to a girl won't cure you. Why don't you cook something up that it was your boss who forced you into having sex with him you retaliated so that's why he sent those pics as a revenge?</h1>
<p>PS- I really can't understand that how the denial of sex can make people ruin the lives of others. Damn stupid!</p>
