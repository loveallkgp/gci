<p>Even i have confessed earlier in this group How i got used since childhood n How i became a Gay. Finaly How i cheated by my senior. Here comes after i got cheated by my senior Usually i met many guys But never had sex with Any one as i was in love with my senior just avoided the guys i met through planet romeo n Facebook . When i got cheated by him thought love Doesnt grow between guys in India. All Fuckin mind in karnataka guys all need sex But Not love. So Then i started to explore my sexuall activity with guy i met with nearly it was about 1yr of journey. as a Engineer student i dint knew exactly about the disease caused by sex n all i used to enjoy the things in it Finally had Anal sex with condom n i enjoyed it too. Hardly i gave my ass to 2 guys with rest only Body enjoyment n hugs n kisses. One day i had a sex with guy when i drunk He Did Anal sex with Me without condom i could Not resist as i was in alcohol effect. Next Morning i Dont know What to do Even He told that He s safe How can i believe him ? I was mentally suffered a lot for 3month my medical friend told Its necessary to check once after 3 moth of Havin sex  with hiv unknown status guy . Finally i got checked for hiv after 3 month it came negative. Then i thought Gay sex is a bull Shit all need sex But Not love So i decided to be out of it Finally Its been 5month Not met anyone But Still my love with senior comes to mind sometime as it was my 1st love . Its difficult to erase from my life.</p>
