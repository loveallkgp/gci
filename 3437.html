<p>I like to confess today, since its been days i am going through all confessions so now its hard to keep everythin inside..which hurts a lot. I met a guy in a training institute. He is much likely very good looking and he goes to gym so totally looks like a hunk. As day passed we started getting close as a best friend and soon we started drinkin together. In a wierd way he started enjyin taking me with him to piss and he nicely takes his huge thing out and i couldnt stop seeing him peeing so closely and even i used to piss with him. we both watch each other doing this but we never touchd each other. As we were best frds so day by day my feeling has grown so much that i wanted to cuddle him and sleep with him in bed like a baby and grab him tight. We use to discuss our personal things about daily sex habits. Again whenever we use to go out we never miss chance to pee together and see each other dick. being so close to his body while peeing i could barely stop myself to not to touch his part. two time i could not stop so i grab his dick and he went like don touch it. still we continued our thing and waching each other peeing. one day i dcyded to tell him abt my feeling that i like to be more close to him, so i dcyded to say this when we both were drunkd. and i did. since then he did not answer my call and blocked me on wats app and deleted me from bbm. now surprisingly we both work in same building, so he knows when i take break to go out. and whenever i do he comes outside and watch me from far to see what i am doing.i take break three to four times in a day and he also manages to come outside on every break every day. he also has girl friend. i feel am doomed and dont knw what to do. everytime i see him i feel like cuddling him and holding him tight. i miss old days when we used to have laugh and good times together.. since we do not talk anymore it becomes more difficult to see him outside ofc and try not to get more into depression. i really wish if he could be with me, even if it has been temporary i wouldnt mind but i wanted his friendship. i am lost dont know what to do, every minute i think of him.. any helpful thoughts for me!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Isn't it weird that some guys latent gay stuff but they go mad when someone talks about to them and they go perfectly effing straight? Bleh.. I don't like that sort.</h1>
