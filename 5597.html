<p>Hello I m too much confused I am is.y b.sc student . today I want to certify my journal so went to hod sir office hod sir is quit goodluking guy when I entered in office after taking permission he was itching his private part by inserting his hand in to his pant I was observing him but he continued it for few secs and he sign on my journals certificate without taking my viva I was surprised !! He is very strict and journally ask a tough questions during viva so he likes me or interested in me or he is gay too what should I do I like him coz he is hotty admin plz suggest me what to do</p>
<h1>GCI- That is kind of an harassment. I'd say do nothing. Just let it be. If he likes you or not, his way of approaching is not good. Doing an action like that is weird. I'd stay away if I were you.</h1>
