<p>There is something which deserves our condemning. Deepika padukone's latest video. </p>
<p>In the name of new age order / liberalism / women empowerment / equal rights, etc promiscuity is promoted by Deepika and team. ( I was expecting something from Preethi actually for a 2015 doze, its already April )</p>
<p>What has happened as response is, those already homophobic media, started to project lesbians, who would truly want to live with another girl for the rest of their lives as anti social / anti ethical elements, and are a threat to the so called proverbial culture of India. The problem is with Deepika who quoted things like, " I can have sex outside marriage, my choice; I love both a man and a woman, my choice; etc" </p>
<p>This creates two bad impressions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bisexuals are innately cheaters; they cheat a man or a women or both </li>
<li>Lesbians ( which also means gays ) are unethical people, anti social elements, 
( since she quoted lesbian love in the list of her promiscuous choices ).</li>
</ol>
<p>Why I am writing this here is, we , LGBT community, never ever support issues like, sex outside of marriage, Bisexual people living both with a guy and girl at a time, cheating either one or both.</p>
<p>We need to rise our voices strongly against those rootless zombies who claim to be the flag bearer of new age order in 21st century India.   </p>
<h1>GCI- Ok i though not to say anything bcoz much had been said already..but u forced me to...here goes..</h1>
<p>1- SEX is highlighted as the main agenda..why??
2-  Define loyalty?? To me loyalty is not dependent on sex only..PERIOD!
3- MALE PRIVILEGE AND FEMALE HONOUR...can we put the pros and cons??
4- Y is it so that consent and choice are so misunderstood??are we that fucking kids to take everything literally?? This shit has already made the religious bigots act like pseudo gods and the sole authoritarians of god..
5- Lastly my point what do u consider empowerment and freedom??</p>
