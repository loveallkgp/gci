<h1>VIV #ABBY: Hey guys.....i just love reading d confessions and ur reactions on them.....something to confess here:</h1>
<p>My story and my problem:-
I am dating a girl who is frm IIM ,....a straight forward and an open minded sweet company to me....we are dating since last couple of months...she proposed me....she had a bf ...but things dint worked out between them and as i came in her life...she found a new ray of hope and i also kindda liked her and instantly we just got each other..... i do feel sexually attracted to her but not always....m more in guys.....Now some time back she confessed to me that she is a bisexual and was in a relationship with a girl(i always dreamt of having a lesbian gf.. :D)....I took it good....things are still good between us.....but a guilt is in my heart and mind that should i tell her that i am gay/bi too......some friends suggested to keep it to myself.....NOW the PROBLEM is:
a) I do not find any girl sexually attracted coz i am a gay ..... may be i would hook up with her some day but that would be only a compromise to prove my masculinity...so i want to confess my feelings to her.....
b) We agreed for a 5year marriage when she opened herself to me.....its just a way to keep our parents and the society shut for some time.....she wanted to get settled with a girl and i with a guy/or/ i might want to live alone with my kids....she accepted the proposal to have my kids....
During the marriage we are open to date other people....but she will be a full-stop for my girl affair and me for her boy affair...she can date other girls and me other boys....although i never told her tha i am a gay....she is free to date other girls.....If we are unable to find true love ....we can continue with the marriage or else if one of us finds any we will directly head for a divorce....
NOW.....i feel that i am cheating on my parents.....my society for manipulating them by doing such a cruel act....
@ADMIN: guide me and plzz help me to clear my conscience....thanks in advance......!!!</p>
<h1>Viv- Yaar tum log itna soch kaise lete ho? Anyways, if she was truthful with you, you have to be truthful with her. Tell her that you are more into guys. If you both have already decided everything then what is keeping you away from divulging about your sexuality? And trust me its not cruel. You are not cheating the parents. Do not even think about the society. It does nothing good. Just be calm and do whatever you feel is right until it harms anyone.</h1>
