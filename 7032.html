<p>I am 23 gay and in love with a guy. We are both in closet and can't come out as our family very strict. They might kill me if they ever find out. I have job here and he is in family business. So moving out of city is not a option. So we act as brothers in public. We also never had sex since we both live with families and never get privacy. All we do is secretly hold hands during movie. I don't know what kind of love is this where we will never get to be together and maybe marry some girl in future. Isse accha hota I would have remained single.</p>
<h1>GCI- Ek thappad for the last line!</h1>
<p>U r GAY not some abhorred creature u nincompoop. 
U can't come out its fine but don't blame it on being gay, blame it on u being a coward to be afraid of death.</p>
<p>IF U CAN'T DIE FOR WHAT U FEEL IS RIGHT THEN DON'T LIVE FOR WHAT U KNOW IS WRONG! 
Period!
I m so done with people longing to crave for holding the victim card of being GAY and then doing all the shitty stuff thereafter in their entire shitty life and making it difficult for others who are out and proud and making a difference.</p>
<p>YA YA GO ON MAKE ANOTHER PRIYA VEDI CASE...even my ass doesn't care!</p>
