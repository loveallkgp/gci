<p>Hi guys,
I am in relationship with a guy. We have been together for 3 years. We fight and forgive a lot. Something happened a couple of weeks before that has put our relationship in question. 
One of ex love interest was in the city and has no place else to stay for few nights. I asked my partner and he agreed. One night, I end up drinking one too much. It impaired my senses. I don't remember anything after that. Next morning, I find myself naked in bed with that guy. My partner saw me and left for work while I was still asleep. It was awkward for me to be in the same bed with that guy. I asked that guy to leave and better stay in hotel. Now my partner doesn't believe a thing I said. He was there when we were drinking but went to bed early coz he had work in the morning. He left a note yesterday that he is leaving and asked me not to follow him. I truly love him and will do anything for him. Please guys advise.</p>
<h1>GCI : what's is it .... a goddamn bollywood movie ??? no matter how heavily you are drunk you still have senses to know if you are having sex or not. for god sake ... was it just drink or 'date rape drug' you took ??</h1>
<p>i don't know i would be mad too , if my bf had done it . what do you expect .and what about you so called ex love interest ???? was he drunk too.</p>
