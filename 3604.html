<p>The admin is studying in Canada. He has the privilege to be out of this sexist, homophobic country. And he can be there, settle there and have a great life. His comments are also very liberal. Cause you obviously enjoy the liberty there. But honestly, as a gay teenager who has no prosect of leaving the country anytime soon, all this advice seems like false hope. I mean, I'm open to my friends about being gay. But this doesn't mean, I can be very open about it. We can't date freely, can't even do anything. I have to mind my words while in public. One small mistake and my life would crumble down to pieces. We simply don't have the luxury of being openly gay, out and proud, in our country. Although I do appreciate the admin's advice on everything. But sometimes it seems you're just rubbing it in our faces. We get it, we all should be accepting of ourselves. But living where we do, it isn't possible to do that without dire consequences. :-(</p>
<h1>GCI- I just moved here a month ago. Like literally a month ago. For full 23 years I have lived in India in an extreme homophobic environment. Still I made myself liberal in that very place 3 years ago and not something after I came here. Hope its clear now.</h1>
<p>As for the other portion of your confession, you cannot use the environment to hide the truth. I have told you guys to be comfy with yourself and don't bother for the society much as society will always speak ill of those who are different. Is it really like rubbing my views on your faces or make you accept yourself without judging you? You have a wonderful life. Don't waste it by living in fear by think about the dire consequences. :)</p>
