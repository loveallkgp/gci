<p>Ummm Hey Fellas</p>
<p>Soo I'm a 17 year old guy who has VERY recently accepted himself(after a looooooong battle with self ... Phase that included long periods of self hate nd depression ...... I'm over now :)
So
Now that I have accepted myself I want to come out as in OUT
Out to parents
To friends .. everyone in general not that I'm going to get it published in newspapers ... Im just done with living with a lie
Feeling what I feel is immoral nd dirty ....wait .... It is a bit dirty ;)
Anyways so here I am
Opened a new fake account
Creeping out of the closet (samara Morgan style hehe ) Im out to my brother nd a friend</p>
<p>But here's the thing there are times when I feel like I have no future I feel lonely and depressed and unwanted
In a place where love is not respected even by our own community
It's a shame really how can a young guy like me dream of a perfect dreamy husband when all I see around me (on net on obviously since I don't see open gay ppl where I live ) is horny assholes (pun intended) who think of nothin but sex
When love gets reduced to just a blowjob what am I supposed to believe in ?
I see no future for myself really that's the worst depressing bottom of what you can feel
I know my family will accept me they love me too much
But knowing you will never have someone to wake up to
To go home to .... It's difficult for me
Guess I'm just a silly hopeless romantic but aren't we supposed to feel this way
To want to b wanted ... To b loved ?
I wish there were more open couples out there .... Near where I live so I could hope</p>
<p>I'm a big dreamer ( not a sick joke :P )
And I hope to find love nd friendship and for once forget that my love is any different than someone elses
I hope to find acceptence and love
Hope to b able to get married
Raise children
Be silly in love .......</p>
<p>Yes im finished with my rant :P
Those who are still reading. Thank you and hats off to u guys hehehe :P it means a lot to me that someone heard what i had to say :) love ya :* </p>
<p>Chandigarh</p>
<h1>Viv- WOW! You are from chandigarh! Cool! BTW, what you just wrote is truly amazing. Its hard to find a nice guy to settle with. Our community hasn't really developed the idea of being in a relationship. Many people go in a relation in their youth but ultimately they have to marry. But this scenario is changing. Slowly and slowly we will evolve. The change cannot happen overnight. You just have to have patience and you are only 19. You know, where you could find a guy with potentials like yours? An LGBT rights NGO. Because guys over there are not bound by the pressure of the society and dream just like you. Have a happy life.</h1>
