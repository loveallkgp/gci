<p>Ok, i just returned from a month trip from Belgium, France , Netherlands etc. It taught me many things, before beginning, i am not trying to undermine anyone's felling for India, its a good country, and if i do i apologize in advance, im just writing what ia experienced and felt and i have a right to feel how i feel :P</p>
<p>a) Though LGBT is not widely common there but its easy to find traces of it. and its not a big deal there, as you know most Europeans consider marriage an outdated institution.</p>
<p>b) Most LGBT population there consists of teenagers, if u join one of their LGBT fb groups etc. you would not normally find people desperate for sex, they would have their own profile pic and maintain a real, not a shady profile, unlike here, When U try to contact some gay boys and all their profiles are filled with pictures of dicks and ads- "im free today, any1 wna meet?" "have place?" 
Jesus-__-
so yeah, "being gay" is not well integrated in the society here, i dont know whose fault this is, i guess a little of everyone, and i dont even think it can change, not before several decades anyways</p>
<p>c) being a pansexual, i would also comment on this -
here people pay too much attention/care to girls as if they are princesses, and even the girls are brimming with attitude. i find this lame and stupid. Here all the burden is on boys- treat her nicely, ask her out and all that shit!
i was glad to see that European girls were more "easy" to make friends with, no attitudes, no weirdness etc. and im just talking about "friendship"</p>
<p>d) Gay bars are common in Belgium, Netherlands. I was like literally laughed at the face of the security guard in "My bar, CP" when he allowed a group of girls to enter in before us, while we were waiting long before them. and belive me there was a "LINE" hahahaha xD
atleast there, you would find a bar on every corner of the street,  and gay bars are filled with young crowd, btw is there any open gay bar in NCR, Delhi?, not some shady attic.</p>
<p>well thts it for the confession, wish i can get a job somewhere there, there is nothing better than an open minded society.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm.....good for u and not so good for us!</h1>
<p>Anyways how are the boys in France...they are quite yummy!</p>
