<p>When i was about say 6-7 years old. I used to fantasize about wrestling and getting dominated by my older cousin.but i had no idea about it. Like other boys I used to 'BELIEVE' that i like this particular girl.And i had been chided sometimes for my feminine behavior. and i remember how i used to suppress it
Big change came when i got admitted in a prestigious school in sixth standard. Everyone came from a high class society and people were selfish and self centered( it is ironic that one often find most honest helpful people in small town/villages and not the cities-the centres of civilization). Added to the fact was that i was the shortest boy in the class,too slim and looked too much younger than my age. I was openly derided for this fact. Even teachers used to comment how emancipated and dwarfish i looked.
Soon this insecurity about my height turned into what we call Napoleon complex. I was obsessed with my height. I used to curse god for making me a dwarf and feminine. And what really befuddled me was that guys much smaller than me of the same ages somehow never got bullied.And yet i was always picked on (i would realize much late that my femininity/childlike nature were the contributing factor).I used to blame my height for everything. though it was much deeper. In those time of frustration and utter despair i wish somehow i would have known what was going on with me.Accurate guidance at this stage can prevent a soul from much trauma.
I uses to talk to people but i never had a friend in school. To prevent from getting noticed sitting alone in the recess i used to go to the water cooler(which was far away) and come back. TWICE.i had only one real friend (a girl) and that summarizes most of my childhood.
Anyways those long tormenting years finally concluded. I am in fourth year of college now. I now know exactly who i am. And I am proud of it. Made lots of friends here. Went on numerous trip with them. Made two best friends. (both straight :P). My friend cares for me. and I for them. My sister loves me and accepts me. I have become such a positive and optimistic person now :). When i look back at those year sometimes, A cold shiver run up my spine and cause my hairs to stand on their end. And I see images of my tormentor mockingly smiling at me . And I smile Back them and say "you are history. and its over! :) ". I swear sometimes those images betray a feeling of discomfort. probably a regret. But i guess i'll never know!</p>
<h1>GCI- And that's how, my dear friends, the acceptance and coming out of the trauma and help you! The future can be made better only if you have the will power for that! Don't just stand there and blame yourself of God. Everything is in your hands.</h1>
