<p>Hii admin How's u? . . Today i want to share my feelings with you guys M a gay Its sucks me but sometime i feel lucky to be unique .. now move to my confession :- Actually I never met a gay in my life but I chat many gays n calls them too (only for knowing that peoples which are same like me) But finally this May 2014 I got a person who touched my soul .....finally first week of june we met n enjoyed He gave me a expensive gift n we did some fun shun n all But now in August he wants break up There is. No argu b/w us no chances of break up I love him so much I want him Late nite m crying fr that person When I ask to.my bf :-why u want break up He simply said ""Yr main apko time ni de pata"" But when I said ""no problem dear its ok m very happy i know ur life is too bsy but i will manage If u send one msg to me In this m.very happy"" But guys he doesn't wanna any excuse He said he hates me Dnt know why he doing all this with me Perhaps he got a bf Bt sometime he said he will b engage in December But he hurts me M crying allot ;( I concluded that searching TRUE love in gay life is like searching snake pearl in the groups of snake Thanks admin to read this Thanks too admin if u post this</p>
<h1>GCI- Sorry for you buddy. I really can't understand that why people can't take a stand for themselves. They can fall in love, can swear to live with each other and do things for each other, but when the time comes to actually prove the love, they back out while the other person is left broken to bits. And that;s how destiny had a fall. What could have been a better ending experience, it was blown by the fire of cowardice.</h1>
