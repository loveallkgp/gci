<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Just want to share my feelings. please do not try to play with my feelings it really hurting me till now all becos of my gay friend.</p>
<p>actually we both studied in the same college and we were same roommates in the hostel. that time i was not getting any feelings for him and that time i was not a gay.
As soon he left the hostel i started feeling for him and i badly wanted him to stay with me.</p>
<p>in the final year somehow i stayed with him outside college hostel that time we were sharing our personals. that was my heavenly days. suddenly one enemy came between us.
that enemy and my friend is from same department. I am from different department.</p>
<p>In college almost all the time my friend will share his time with that enemy, when ever i see this i totally hate that enemy.</p>
<p>Now my friend is not at all spending his time with me always he s with that enemy.</p>
<p>what should i do now ???</p>
<p>please genuine comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>really i hate that enemy who took my best friend from me.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
