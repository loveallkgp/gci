<p>Hello!!</p>
<p>While tears roll down my eyes, my hand started scribbling about the shit I m undergoing from past few months... :( Kindly people out der, make some tym to read my story...</p>
<p>Being brought up in an orthodox family, I was not allowed to play out wid other kids; d reason behind s I was adopted n my parents didnt want me to run away.. As the days passed, I became ery much emotional n sensitive.. I would take friendship so close to heart dat sometyms I used to do write every assignments to my bestie... But for watever reasons, my intense friendship dint yield any results n I moved on..</p>
<p>Teenage was d major setback in my lyf, coz I had to undergo shits like taunting n bullying for no reasons... Everyone used to take advantage of my softness n exploited me to d max..</p>
<p>Finally, I made up my mind to be a solitude.. But I got a very good friend whom I started caring more den my lyf.. N he also cares me more den his girl friend. I never felt sexually attracted to him coz I love him truly n I believe its a soul bondage.. And, dis bondage is posing danger to me.. I feel very bad on myself for hiding my secrets wid him.. coz he havent hid anything me.. :( He dislikes gays n I m sure on dat part.. He has worst opinion on gays n bisexuals.. So, if i say dat I m one among dat, he will pakka screw our friendship.. At d same tym, I feel I m not fit to be his friend; d reason is I m not a stylish dude lyk him n cant match his bandwidth... I am sure, I m not giving my 100 percent friendship to him wic he deserves.. I m lost in my life.. Wen ever he cares me , tears roll down automatically coz I m not worth getting his care.. I am thinking of avoiding him n slowly move from his lyf.. But d very thought of d same, gets me suicidal thoughts.. I m sure, i cnat live widout him coz if I am happy n my lyf, dats bcoz of him.. :( Hell wid me.. I shuldnt have born on dis earth n as my birth parents dumped me, someone shuld have thrown me to river... :( ;( My Life Sucks to d core :(</p>
