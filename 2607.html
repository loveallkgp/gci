<p>Me and one of my frnd was visiting another frnd's village house as we were invited to attend a 300 yr old kali puja,thats not relevant, btw me and my other invited frnd were sleeping in a single bed,so i got up early nd not feeling much sleepy as new places dnt suits for sleeping,i already hv a crush for him though i dnt knw abt his orientation neither my frnds know abt my bisexuality, so i tried to check his oenis out while he was sleeping,i gather courage and go for his dick,when i got his penis it was erected and was so big,i hold it tightly(dont know from where i got that much courage) ,press it two or more times bt alas then my hosting frnd berge in,thank god he had nt noticed anything, then nothing happened afterwards that day,i told him later prankfully that i hd pinched in his penis to wake him up,he took it casually, i hv a doubt about a thing,i hv shared room with him on my 1st yr of clg,one thing i hv i had noticd he dont sleep that much deep,even a little sound makes him disturbed while his sleeping, bt how cn he cnt feel anything while i was touching him,was he enjoying it?? He is also little bit anti feminist, he dont like to b that much frank in front of our mutual female frnds,sometimes i fl i cn get him 4 me or ask him out bt sometimes he shows appealation towards a junior girl,he says she is first nd las love,dnt knw he dont evn hv courage to express his love 4 her, one day we hv a fight ovr smthing i forgot,i was so broke inside i thought of ending my frndshp with him bt i cnt afford it... So what do u think guys,what should i do???</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm plainning to stay with a person that you described will be nothing more than a pain in the ass. Be his friend. Simple. And find someone who has much more clarity in thoughts.</h1>
