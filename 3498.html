<p>I recently broke up with guy whom I never met. He used to stay in NYC and was going to visit here soon, in this month. Now, when I try to hold a conversation either via phone or whatsapp he doesn't reply and stay numb (God knows what's going on in his mind). Last time when I questioned he replied he'd claim me after coming to India. I've decided to move on, thinking he has his own life, why it should be wasted for someone he never loved. I know it sounds weird but I curse maself am I really that bad? And Is it too much to ask for a real love, something that'd last? Now what I'm doing is socializing on grindr, keeping ma pic on display, getting noticed by end number of guys etc. I'm confused what should be done with this fucking life? It's good to be a gal or straight guy so that you can easily be with person. Here, we don't visit court to get divorced and ones decisions is more than enough to shatter other's life. Lol, I was once tagged by a name 'relationship seeker' when I expressed my feeling and emotions. Now ma question is, should I still hope for a love here or I just have sex when needed?</p>
<h1>GCI- It totally depends upon you. If you wanna have sex when needed and you feel good about it, then go for it. If you wanna seek a relationship then its also fine. See, you cannot make decisions on the suggestions that come through us or through the people who called you "relationship seeker". I think you are wise enough to decide what is indeed good for you.</h1>
