<p>It was the wedding day of my sister, the best day of my sister's life. I was so happy for her, but anxious for myself. You know how indian weddings are. Lots of gathering, and fun - but not for me. I was making prayers to GOD every second for a certain person NOT to come to my sister's wedding. It was my in-law's (brother in law) brother. I had already been his victim. </p>
<p>In Ashirbad, he had made fun of my effeminate nature. For him I was ADHA ADMI ADHA aurat (half woman-half man). He had recommend to my parents that I should be sent to a doctor. My parents nodded their heads and said that I needed exercise to make myself fit in society, because society never accepts a feminine boy.</p>
<p>Then came the wedding. I was afraid to go to the lodge where the marriage would be held, but I did, because as the bride's brother, I had to participate -- although I never felt that I was her 'brother'! Then, the monster arrived, and started his nasty act, making me uncomfortable with his weird and unwanted touches. I was not in a position to stop him. I was uncomfortable, and he was enjoying my feminine reaction of disgust at his nasty touch and my wanting it to stop. </p>
<p>During the course of the wedding he continued to make me uncomfortable -- not only him, but his friends, imitating my walk and talk, making me more afraid and horrified with every passing second. </p>
<p>When he was not satisfied with this game, he had a new game on his mind. He started to undress me to prove whether I was a man or woman. This did not succeed because someone politely requested that he stop. </p>
<p>His next game was the introduction game. He took me around and introduced me to every person in the hall as a adha admi and aurat...half man and half woman...the crowd was laughing. They loved to see a adha admi and aurat..they were enjoying my feminine voice as I tried to protest the abusive treatment They clearly were amused at the rare chance to see a mixture of both sexes.</p>
<p>It was my didi's wedding so everyone thought I should entertain the crowd. My parents thought that there was nothing wrong in it, that is was just a game. But to me, dear mum and dad, it was not a game -- it was a rape</p>
<h1>GCI : dude ... were your parents out of their mind or what ????  i mean a random person from outside comes and makes fun of their son in front of the crowd and tells your parents to 'take you to doctor because you are ill '' and all they do is nodd their head . :O :O</h1>
<p>my father would have taken gun out and shot that rascal in  head . if not my father , i would have shamelessly asked my parents '' why they aren't taking any action to this dickhead and i seriously would have thrown him out ''. that's my house ... nobody from outside can come to me there and make fun of me. and you should have shared it with your parents that they tried to undress you . </p>
<p>to be frank , you shall go today and ask your parents why they didn't take action ?? that totally means your parents think he was right ' for calling you ill ' . you shall make things clear with parents . i go to my parents and talk whatever the matter is ....  know your power . a feminine man  doesn't mean you are weak .</p>
