<p>Let's have an insight into the recent scenario of LGBT activism.
Some points i would like to put up in here:
Firstly, So far i see, LGBT activism is apparently restricted into 'marching the rainbow pride parade in a go-as-you-like mode' , arranging debate sessions n inviting renowned people around the world, printing a few copies of leaflets to aware the community people regarding some issues, and mostly organising gay parties to have FUN n calling them fund-raising parties for some noble cause.</p>
<p>And who get involved into these different activities?</p>
<p>Pride Parade: Everyone.
Interactive Sessions: A bunch of intellectual people who speak decent english.
Leaflets: Typed by someone who likes to write a lot n pretends to be a writer, but never happened to publish anything of his own.
Parties: Everyone awaits for this only, n this is undoubtedly the best place for hookups n instant sex.</p>
<p>Well, if you follow their curriculum, gay parties are the one n only thing they try to arrange several times a year.</p>
<p>I am not against anything they do, rather i verymuch support their activities for bringing this socially forbidden integral part of human race out of the closet n keeping the whole culture alive.</p>
<p>But sometimes i feel that this whole thing is very much overrated n all these activities are not meant for social acceptance, fundamental rights or else; they are meant to have FUN only.</p>
<p>P.S : this is a confession indeed, not a problem-solution post.</p>
<h1>GIC- Take this confession a bit forward and suggest what other stuff we could do to spread awareness about rights and social acceptance?</h1>
