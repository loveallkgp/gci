<p>My confession goes like this, I was kinda feminine during my childhood. I was a shy boy with a soft voice and I loved to polish my nails. I used to play with dolls rather than going out and play with my friends. I was bad in sports but I was always ranked as a good student in class. I was happy with everything by then, but gradually things started getting worse. I was brutally bullied by my own brother. Usually he used to call me with a very cheap name. Not only him but his friends in the city also knew this and then they started calling me by that name. I was totally broken down. I had no courage to go out of my home because I was always scared of my my brother and his friends. Sometime even some small kids call me by that name. I had no clue how to handle that pathetic situation. I always tried to avoid/ignore it. Every morning i used to wake up with a hope that no one will tease me by that name. This happened for around one year and One day My grandfather heard my brother calling me by that name. He stood so strongly beside me and clearly warned him not to repeat it anymore. He said that if he again hear him calling by that name he could do anything to protect me. Since then no body calls me by that name.
My grandfather, who even does not know what homosexuality means is a true inspiration for me. I am always grateful for him.
Now I have been transformed to a masculine guy. I am well educated and have a good career. We share a good brotherhood. But sometime I recall my past and my nerves get filled with hatred. Deep inside my heart, i have a feeling that i can never excuse him for his deed. I feel like spitting him on his face.
Guys do you have any suggestion to get rid of this agony?</p>
<h1>GCI- Your grandfather did a very good deed. The agony can't be forgotten until you speak about it. He cannot realize it until it is said on his face. He made your life hell for a year and that's not small. Maybe it is time you could finally discuss it with him.</h1>
<p>However I am a little bit skeptic now. You are speaking about masculinity like it is some award winning thing. Why is that?</p>
