<p>I have a dark confession to make. A dark secret that l always keep and would never share. But l can't keep it to myself anymore. It happened last year march. I was in  hostel and my roommate had one big bear friend . He is also very nice to me. He happened to get drunk and enter my room while my roomate was night out. He was drunk, and big . First he ask where abouts my roommate. I told him he was night out. He starts kissing me and grabbing my balls. I was suprised. Then he grabbed me and try to enter me. Because of my fear l don't resist, as he was drunk it does not go so smooth. He kind of pissed n bcoz of my fear that he will punish me . I give him blowjob. But he can never cum. So, l quit him. I just stop . After only l knew he won't hurt me. I dropped him to his room and return to my room and lock myself. I can't even sleep. I thought of committing suicide. The next day afternoon he come to my room again .he asked me if l enjoyed last night.l asked instead whether u sleep with anyone before last night . He told me he had sex with many people before me.  He still drinks too. I kind of pissed . He told me Don't Fuck Me Again. I get so pissed. I left him all alone in my room. Next few days when l was with my roommate, he came. He Hi. Me . I reply him without looking. As l am still mad at him. After not many days . He committed suicide. I felt so guilty and feel my life a cursed. I did actually get cursed. So.. I can't redeemed myself. I don't even wanna meet people. I don't wanna hurt people again. I just stay alone. I even distance myself from my friends. Till now l was haunted by that incident.so  This is my dark confession that's all l can share.</p>
<h1>GCI- I will tell u three things here.</h1>
<p>1- The guy was depressed because of something.
2- U r living with too much insecurity and false hopes of being the 'gay damsel in distress'.
3- Stop living with so much baggage for the time being and build ur career first....that counts more than ur sexuality for the tym being.</p>
<p>P.S- He might had been a closet case and suffering from clinical depression and sex for him might not had been the therapeutic effect as he might had been looking for. And he died.....So do u also want to join the suicide brigade or what????</p>
<p>P.P.S- It was human and not ;'dark' unless u killed the guy with ur own bloody hands.</p>
