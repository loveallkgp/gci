<p>My fear of not getting acceptance by my family is really drifting me away from them. I cant decipher myself that why i feel that my family will not accept me. I hardly talk to my real brother and even when we do it, it come across as liability talk just because we are tied in blood relation. Its not just about acceptance, my family and relatives are in a very close nit circle, what i feel is even if for my sake my family atleast my parent accept me, they will have a hard time speaking it up in relative circle, maybe kind of ashamed. I reckon that i am the first one in our relatives 3 generation circle that i have seen.</p>
<p>$ABBY : relatives... thanks god we don't have any close bonds with them ... screw those relatives who interfere in your personal family matters or lifes . </p>
<p>and by the way would you tell that to relatives ??? i mean we don't tell anything to relatives ... i find it quite strange .</p>
