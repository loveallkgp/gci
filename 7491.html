<p>Hello fellow humans. So I was chatting with random guys on pr and made a couple friends..very genuine and nice jocks........I never got time to meet any of them as I was constantly busy. All of them have been extremely nice and we continue to chat even today...I keep flirting with them a lot and it gives me joy to see their reactions.....I feel the same way about all of them and I'm equally attached to all and it's hard for me to choose one....i know in and out about these guys and vice versa.....we even talk about future plans and how I want to own a cat and a dog in our future home....it's starting to develop into a virtual fairy tale...and I'm enjoying every bit of it..we plan on meeting soon and time is coming close to choose any one of them as my lover....and I want all of them....choosing is impossible!! Selfish me....</p>
<h1>GCIL- U r the hero of your own story, chose whatever script you want. Just don't ruin or harm anyone unknowingly in ur fairy tale..Gluck!</h1>
