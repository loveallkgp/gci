<p>HI! I'm 21yr old guy studying third yr b tech. I have a man in my life, he's 30. he's scared to get out of the closet and chose to be in it forever. he's like 'maybe my father will curse the day I was born when he gets to know that I'm gay' actually he has seen his gay friend coming out, medicated to cure him (lol) and finally dissuaded by family (still married in US). I'm not sure that I love him or not, but to me he's like a father I never had. I can never admire him sexually. but lately, he said he loves me and asked me to 'kill him'( kill this love) asap. he says I deserve a b'ful loving boyfriend( which he is not, to him). now problem is,I respect love and their are really very few precious people in my life whom I can't afford to lose, yes he's one of them. my life til now has made me very sensitive towards love issues, as I came from a broken family. I found that 'love' is my challenge in this life (considering me being gay in India, family issues). he is the only person who can control me, guide me. I don't listen to anyone. no one. I live on my own terms, privately. I'm pagan by religion and not Hindu. so #viv these are few facts about me. I don't know why I'm confessing,or what I expect by confessing here. I think I'm a bit naive.</p>
<h1>Viv- Sad to see a 30 year old(who could be financially independent) scared of his family. But you two just have a 9 year difference. Logically he can never be a father figure. BTW, have you tried telling him all of these things? I guess you should. Try making him a bit mentally strong. That way you could help him a bit too.</h1>
