<p>I am 34, an Indian gay man from US. Recently came out to my parents .. was very emotional. They've been extra supportive and protective of me but haven't fully come to face with the reality that their son "isn't a man" in their sense of the word "man". I have decided not to pursue straight marriage but looking for like minded gay men in US as LGBT marriages are legalized in some 15 states in the US (incl. mine, Calif.).</p>
<p>Due to my upbringing, I feel only Indian or Indian-origin would be good for me due to the attachment to family, tolerance level within a marriage and values we have. Unfortunately, not many Indian gays in the US want to go the marriage route. Why is it so? Even if I start exploring non-Indian gay men for a LTR, a lot of 'em are looking for well-chiseled 6-pack abs John Abraham types ... I mean, c'mon, seriously.</p>
<p>Why are a lot of Indian gay men only looking for hook-ups? At least in countries that have done so much to get gay marriages legalized, why don't we take advtg. of that? Are most of us not wired in our heads that marriage is a must ...lol. I mean, why do most Indian gay men "waste" their valuable time in not seeking permanent relationships .. do they think its easy spending one's life alone? At least, I wouldn't want to live by myself .. after all I am 34 and none of us are growing any younger, are we?</p>
<h1>Viv- You have wonderful thoughts. But you also understand that most of the gay guys here are in denial, closeted, can't come out ever and have to live dual lives. There is always an option for them to choose the right path though which many don't. At the end of the day they believe that being gay is just a phase of life so have to to a lot of hook ups as pre-marriage fun life and they have to settle down with a girl because it is the ultimate reality. When they get mature and the reality dawns upon them, things get out of their hands. The thought of gay marriage scares many. But worry not, there can be someone worthy for you, maybe on this page! You will get one guy whom you desire soon enough.</h1>
