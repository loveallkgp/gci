<p>I am 29 gay and my collegues used to daily ask me about marriage and stuff and try to set me up with girls. Same at home with my mother forcing me even though she knows im gay. I wasnt able to handle pressure and came out to my boss. His first reaction was "your sure. You look normal" then he told me not to ruin my life in such things and get married soon. But however most of my teammates stopped asking me about marriage and some even stopped talking to me. When alone with me, they used to act fidgety as if i will touch them. Once in a team party many were drunk and my boss humilated me. In front of evryone he said gays r lucky. They have sex every night whereas we have to beg our wives. He even asked which guy from our team do i want to do it? I just feel so sick and want to quit my job.</p>
<h1>GCI- Actually honey, those people are the ones that are sick. Quit that job if you want to because they will always make you feel bad. There are companies in India which does not allow any discrimination against their gay employees. They follow the rules of safe space. And just tell your mother to stay quiet and accept you as you are. Forcing someone again and again to get married even when they know the truth is gross.</h1>
