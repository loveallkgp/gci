<p>Just wanted some opinions.. I am GAY nd support BJP. Why does evryone say that i m an ignorant rascal? wich mainstream political party favours Gay rights? To hell with the parties, a massive majority of the population doesnt, why expect BJP to do it then? Despite being anti-gay i feel its taking all the right measures for development of the country! Nd India First is what i believe in too! CRITICISMS WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED!</p>
<h1>GCI- No party does. Congress ruled for 10 years and did nothing. AAP removed LGBT agenda from their manifesto because they wanted to focus upon muslim vote bank.</h1>
<p>It's not just about economic development. That's the duty of the government in power. It's about the protection of people that our constitution provides us. </p>
<p>You may believe it or not, the social structure of India is crumbling down even through economically it is rising. There has never been an unrest like this. Bans, hate speeches, vandalism, sexist remarks, oppression, they are abundant these days and the government is doing absolutely nothing. </p>
<p>You tell me one thing. You are a tax paying citizen, are you still okay for being criminalized, put in jail for 10 years or more, being called as a person with mental disease, being called as someone who is unnatural and living in a place where neither the government nor law protects you? If you still think that country should come first always, then there is some serious problem with your opinions.</p>
