<p>Hello everybody...
I am a gay guy from Nagaland. Here is my confession.
I was in love with my best friend for 5 years. He was handsome, kind, generous, child-like and thoughtful. He had a great physique too. All those years of chopping firewood and fetching water from the well definitely shaped him up. He had nice manly arms, a strong chest and a hot pair of muscular, hairy legs.
We met every single day. Once, when he injured his leg in an accident, that did not stop us from meeting. I would go to his home, carry him on my back and bring him to my home. When it started to get dark, I would carry him back to his home. On our way back, he would lean in close to my ear and sing the most corny songs. It never failed to make me laugh.
In the evenings, we would go to the river for a swim and come back home, and lie in my bed in our underwear. Damn! Those moments were pure torture for me... To see him in his underwear just a few inches away from me... Sigh! It took every will power I had to not grab him and kiss him...
I knew he was straight. So I tried my best to respect him.
But as years passed, girls entered his life and I found myself getting jealous or silently fighting for his attention. There came a time when I could no longer carry on.
I was no longer content with just being his friend. I wanted more.
So one evening, as we were out for a walk, I stopped him, took him aside, made him sit down and told him I was gay. He was silent for a moment. When he finally spoke, he told me that he would always be my friend as long as I respected him as a straight man. I was happy he did not freak out by my confession.
But my happiness was short lived. The feelings of jealousy and longing came back stronger than ever before. I became possessive. We began to fight more and more. And one night, I crossed the line and tried to kiss him...
He was so hurt. The look on his face said everything. I had crossed the line. I had disrespected him.
That night, as he was leaving, I watched him go... I waited for him to turn back. But he never did.
That was 5 years ago. We live in separate towns now. We still bump into each other. When we meet, we are still polite. But what we once had, is gone.
It hurts. But I have accepted my mistake. I have learned from it. I am wiser now. I have moved on.
But even now, when I see his photo or see him in person, I feel a sting in my heart... But I am happy for him. And to me, he will always be the boy I carried on my back... &lt;3</p>
