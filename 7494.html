<p>I don't get it why gays act like some village girl. They have so much chance to have fun but they want relation commitment etc as if they have some izzat to protect. I had a good partner but we had lot of fun but suddenly he started hugging, giving gifts, sending senti msgs and all. One day he almost held my hand in public. I am gay privately only and will marry some day. The asshole was going to ruin my reputation. So later we had a fight and I slapped him. He was saying sorry and all but I can't risk my life for such guy who has no respect for other people reputation. I have blocked him.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Trust me I would have slapped you hard with my words if you had been infront of me. OK...some gay guys do that stupid clingy shit but not in your case.</h1>
<p>U sound a sociopathic, narcissist, self obsessed  fuckster who just knows how to propagate hypocrisy. 
Just wait for the karma to fuck your fat ass one day! Burn bitch.</p>
