<p>hello viv, 
 I am the guy with confession no 1525, there were some details that i missed in the first time and wanted to share, thinking that it might change something, after 4th time, we have never had sex and moreover when a night before leaving college, i got cozy with him while being in sleep only, he stopped me and woke me up though we both shut that topic and while i was half asleep, he asked me that do i like him, i somehow dodged the question cos i got scared and we didn't even have a proper discussion on it,  and he was completely fine and normal when we were leaving college, even took care of me as i got emotional, and did a lot .... and practically i agree that i should move on but i am unable to do so, i have faced unrequited love in past as well but never have i felt this much for anyone, for intial few days after coming home i used to cry, even now i miss him all the time viv, it's been two days since i have talked to him and it hurts :( ..... and yeah, there's one more thing, once i read a note written by him, in which he had mentioned things that he wishes to do, and on that list one was , that he wishes to propose a girl, also when we were doing sex for the third time, it took a bit more time and he said that i cannot arouse him, i felt as if he was consoling himself that since he is not getting aroused by me, he is straight but if that was the case then why did he go for the fourth time, i have never loved anyone like i love him which makes me go crazy,need help./......</p>
<p>$ ABBY  : darling .. you love him .. alright but it also counts ' if he loves you too' . ??? if yes .. meet him .. if no move on . or otherwise keep on being sad , crying and wiping your tears in his memories , ruin your career and health for him....  but get it this way he won't come back . 
so cheer up .. </p>
<p>notice : ( don't anybody in comments say ' its not that easy abby ''... and ruin my speech ... i know its not easy .. i know it very well but do you have other plan baby ) . its not impossible.</p>
