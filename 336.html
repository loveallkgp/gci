<p>I really like a guy, who is openly gay, with whom i became friends in fb. He is like 6 years older than I. He is not in a relationship or anything. Now how should i make him know that i am interested in him ? No, i am not looking for a hook-up or something. I really like him, i fancy a relationship with him and the like. I have never dated or had any fling with anyone. So i am confused what to do. How should i tell him that i like him ?</p>

<h1>Viv- Well know his attitude first, if hes friendly or haughty. If he is friendly then directly, "Would you like some coffee with me?" If he is proudy and have attitude around the neck, then approach with caution. BTW, your feelings are really admirable.</h1>
