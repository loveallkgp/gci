<p>20, kolhapur, maharashtra.
I am an engineering student, I met a guy on fake fb ID. He is from my college only. 1st i got scared that, it's not safe to having gay friend...but we both fell in love. After, 2 months we shared our first kiss. He always took care like i am his gf.
we spend lots of nights in eachothers arms :) he never forced me for sex. But on his 19th birthday, he wished to have sex. I wasn't ready. But still, i allow him. At his home, on his birthday, we gave each other the sweetest prize of love. :) I liked it alot, so we decided to do it 2-3 times a week :p
then, i got news that, his sister gave birth to a baby girl :). It affected me so badly. I too wanted to have our own child. He tried to understand me, but finally on my 19th birthday he gifted me a lil white kitten. :)
now when i look back, after 1 year there is no1 to hug, kiss, to fight. :) it's over from him. He got a gf &amp; i am happy for him.
but, that kitten is 1 &amp; half yr old now &amp; it gave birth to 3 kittens :*
thanks jaanu for it. </p>
<h1>GCI- He got a gf? Wow!</h1>
