<p>Hi Guys. I need a solution pls.
I'm very emotional. I cry when I'm very happy, I cry when I'm sad. I cry watching sad films. I think you get the idea- I basically cry a lot. At school, I'm called a girl. Didn't bother me much. One day it became bad, they teased me after the teacher scolded me for something I didn't do. I went mad and beat up 2 guys in my class. Got suspended too. When I went back, I was considered a ruffian and a bully. As a result, I don't have many friends. I log into this fake id and chat with new people everyday. I love chatting but when they start asking for pics, phone number, etc, I get afraid and log out. I've been told that I'm childish, but a child laughs a lot right? I'm so fed up with life now! I pray to Jesus everyday to kill me. I hate myself. How do I ever overcome all this? I loved playing the guitar as a distraction but smashed it in anger last week. Is it all worth it? Who am I living for? My parents are angry with me for my behavior. Oh God!! Why? Why me?</p>
<h1>GCi- You know the problems but why don't you find the solution to it. Try anger management process and practice it regularly.</h1>
