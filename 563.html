<h1>Viv- A mere three months is no time to get settled with your partner. That is wayyyy too early. Trust me. Tell him that you want to be sure that he is definitely "the one" and you have to be comfortable while coming out and also he has to be there for you. But listen one thing. Being in a relation and living with your guy will not at all harm your family situation. You will still study and work like you do and it will still be the same(if we do not consider the anti-gay hysteria). You will still be taking care of your family. If his family is comfy with him being gay, then his parents can also guide your parents. There are many solutions. you just have to look around.</h1>
