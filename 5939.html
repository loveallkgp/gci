<p>[I have a love hate relationship with this page but had to get this out]
The recent incident of AIIMS doctor commiting suicide and blaming it on her gay husband has once again brought the word into mainstream media .
We cant deny, it's a taboo in India to even talk about such things , it gets awkward for me watching news with my parents and anything "gay" comes up . But this particular case is different from others, no one got up to ask for rights or equality . We are forced to experience first hand homophobia {Read one of many India Today's articles covering the story}
This is a case where having equal rights could have actually saved a life and years of shammed marriage . However , the way media has projected it is that being gay is bad and it leads to death of your spouse ... dafaq ? 
But I want to talk about that guy . Coz in that guy I see  many of the people reading this post.
He used to meet people discreetly , used a fake id , even entered a fake - for show relationship . How was he any different from most (i said most not all) guys on this page ? It gives us something as a community to ponder upon .
Ik many people will come forth and ridicule him for marrying a woman in the first place but hey , you cant judge him like that . Many times we dont really have a choice . It's easy for Deepika to say its #MyChoice but you cant expect same from a guy living in haryana where even today cases of Honour killing are heard . Society or family forces us into marriage .
Its easy for an 18 yo kid like me to sit and say boooo why did that man have to marry in the first place and shit but here's the hard talk : If you ever find yourself in such shit Don't Fucking Marry , please _/_ . You have several other options : tell them you dont believe in the institution of marriage itself or give them examples of how your neighbour's new chalaak bahu is mistreating the parents or join RSS and say you're celibating or become a sadhu or brahmachaari . Give them any darn excuse but dont fucking marry .</p>
<p>If you need hope , contact a support group , or some helpline , go online in chat forums and vent out whatever is there inside you . use grindr or meetings to connect with more gays but please dont fucking get into such marriage . Trust me , It gets better ! (It hasnt gotten any good even for me, life is going from bad to worse but Ik someday it will ) And me being me , if I havent given hope , there is no reason you shouldnt .</p>

<h1>GCI- HEAR HEAR....EVEN AN 18 YR CHAP KNOWS THIS....Bcoz when u dissolve ur truth with your hypocrisy..IT SUCKS OUT UR INTEGRITY!!!!</h1>
