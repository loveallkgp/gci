<p>I'm the confessor off confession #3872.
Things even got bad today, as i said that my friend said my roomie and me as gay, my room-mate is very much worried about it. He was a very close and good friend of mine, who can do anything for me. He says let this all come to end, maintain distance with him and even he will do it too. He don't want anyone to say those things again. He starts avoiding me and stopped talking much. I need him back as i don't to want lose my friend who are very few. Help me </p>
<h1>GCI- Then he was never your good friend. If he were, he would have never told you to maintain distance from him. Forget him. He is the one who put more stress on opinions of public rather than the importance of friendship. That's called betrayal of trust what he did.</h1>
