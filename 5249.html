<p>HI
IAM SAM IAM 23 YEARS OF AGE
THOUGH IAM A BISEXUAL WHEN I WAS IN 10TH STANDARD I WAS A BIT GIRLISH TYPE IT CONTINUES TILL I WAS 20 AND PEOPLE USE TO BULLY ME AND I DIDNT EVEN HAVE THE GUTS TO FACE THEM BUT TODAY THINGS ARE CHANGING I ACT LIKE A MAN A PROPER MAN BUT SOME PEOPLE STILL TAUNT ME AND NOW I ACT ACCORDINGLY GIVE AND TAKE POLICY I FACE EVERYTHING I BECAME OUTSPOKEN WHEN THEY BULLY ME KNOW I GIVE THEM BACK BEAUSE NOW I HAVE BECOME STUBBORN STRAIGHT FORWARD AND FEARLESS. I THINK IT JUST COME WITH EXPEREINCE AND I HAVE DECIDED TO LOVE MY SELF MORE THEN BEFORE. WHAT MY EXPREIENCE SAYS THAT SOMETIME RETALIATE IN A BAD WAYS OR BEING STUBBORN IS NECESSARY TO SURVIVE . I WANT TO SAY TO ALL OF GAYS AS WELL AS BISEXUAL PEOPLE JUST DONT ACCEPT ANY NONSENSE WHIH PEOPLE GONNA THROUGHT AT U . JUST DONT TAKE IT SIMPLY LOVE YOURSELF AND GIVE IT BACK TO THEM .. AT THE END YOU HAVE EVERYRIGHT TO HAVE SELF RESPECT TO LOVE URSELF AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY TO BEOME SUCCESSFUL.. SO FOCUS ON UR CAREER RATHER THEN LOVE COZ ONCE U BECOME SUCCESSFULL . LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL RESPECT U AND LOVE U. COZ PEOPLE RESPECT FOR THEY WAY U ARE.. COME ON GUYS LETS WORK ON OWR CAREERi</p>
<h1>GCI- Thats what I have been saying over here all along. People become offended when someone remarks them with the gay word. A few weeks ago I asked a question here that what would they do if someone comes to them and say "You look like gay." Would they be offended or snappy?</h1>
<p>A majority of them said offended. Why would you be offended of your true identity? </p>
<p>It not difficult to feel good about yourself. Once you stop paying attention to "Log kya kahenge", that day will be the best for you.</p>
