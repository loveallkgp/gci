<p>Hi everyone. One guy in my office is almost 31 but still single. He also has some gay qualities like frequently wears pink shirt and doesn't like sports. So I try to stare at him hard and rub my hammer against him whenever I get chance. But he just pulls away. Also he didn't accept my friend request and doesnt reply to any whatsapp msgs i send. When i try to talk to him he just doesnt show interest but I think he secretly loves me too. I found out his home contact from office directory and give blank calls everyday to hear his voice. When he not at desk I secretly lick his water bottle mouth so it's like we have kissed. I even picked one tissue paper from dustbin which he used during cold and kept in my cupboard.  I downloaded all his pictures and joined to naked guys to jerk off. I even use his surname as part of my name secretly. Tell me in whole world is there anyone who will love more than me like this. Then why can't he return my love inspite of being gay.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Bitch and the mother of all chutzpah in the world, that guy irrespective of being gay or not do not deserve a drag like u and have u ever thought even once if he might NOT be gay according to ur CID description or lest him being strt or a guy who doesn't want to be in any relationship??</h1>
<p>What is wrong with the gay people out there like u if I ask??</p>
