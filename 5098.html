<p>hello admin and members.</p>
<p>need a suggestion or help.
there's a guy whom i used to love alot. it's one sided. though he started talking to me, he said he has a crush on me.. n he used to flirt alot so i felt in love with him. but now we are no more friends bcoz of my mistakes. i have said sorry 1000 times , messaged him 1000 times, but he just said that he's not interested on me , n I'm chipku guy. that's why i stopped texting him, calling him.it has been 6-7 months we aren't in contact. and in 23rd jan its his bday. we became friends on his bday.</p>
<p>so my heart's saying to wish him his bday and tell him the date we became friends. but mind is saying.. forget him, don't message, hate him, ignore him and all. these fight between heart n mind .. :/ what's should i do? plz consult me.</p>
<h1>GCI- Yeah, don't text him, call him, miss call him or anything. He is gone for good.</h1>
