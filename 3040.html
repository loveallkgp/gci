<p>Hi. Its sad thing to get bullied by straight people. But its hell to get bullied by other gay people itself.:( When someone who dont know about your sexuality plays with our emotions, you feel down. But when someone who belongs to ur sexuality and tat guy himself had went through the same emotional phases and play with ur emotions , then isnt tat the most painful humiliation in the world? :( Govt never uphold our emotions, parents never support, St. friends cant understand , Same community people even though understand but laugh at u while u are in society. Internal betrayal by community people is most coward thing then betrayal by hetero friends. One thing that I would request with u guys is that IF U CANNOT HELP THE PERSON OF YOUR COMMUNITY EMOTIONALLY , ITS OKAY. BUT PLEASE NEVER TALK ILL OR HUMILIATE THE PERSON OF UR COMMUNITY. Keep in mind, History always repeats ; the insult U do to others will somewhere come back to U in ur life journey but with added humiliation . </p>
<h1>GCI- I hope no one is gonna have any problems with the word I am gonna use because it is AMEN!!!!!</h1>
