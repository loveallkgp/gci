<p>I am 36 yo gay guy. I have a boyfriend since last 2 years. he is 30 yo...He wants me to have a monogamous relationship. But i am too horny, and can have sex with another gay guy at the drop of the hat. One of my other gay friend told me that its ok to have sex outside relationship sometimes.</p>
<p>I am feeling guilty, but i know i can not stop myself. Though i am scared that if my boyfriend gets to know this our relationship will be over.</p>
<p>I am a bottom... and heard that bottoms have more sex drive and they are more horny.</p>
<h1>GCI- Too many stereotypes about this active and passive thingy. Lets not talk about that. But yes, you have a loving bf. Having high sex drives doesn't mean that you have to look for sex outside relationship. Can't you satisfy yourself with your bf? And fuck that friend(figuratively) who says that it is okay to have sex outside relationship. It is soooo not okay! You bf is being loyal. Where does your conscious lie? Get it back together and release the energy in the universe with him!</h1>
