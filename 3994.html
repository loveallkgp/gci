<p>i have told my mum, dad n my bro that i'm gay but i haven't told anyone else .. i sometime dream of having a loving husband, 2 kids, a cute home and an audi Q3 in the future but i am too afraid to go out and talk to other gay people .. i am 24 now n i haven't even kissed anyone yet and i feel that the time is running out i already feel like i'm 50 .. i often tell myself that i would never be with anyone, that i can control my feelings and stay a virgin till i die, and that maybe i would adopt kids and live as a single parent and be happy but then at times i wish that someone would just come out of nowhere and embrace me in his arm and stay with me forever ... i know no one will pop out of nowhere n become my BF or marry me or whatever n so i need to take that 1st step and start meeting gay people but this idea scares the shit out of me </p>
<h1>GCI- Take a leap of faith and start interacting. It never harms anyone if you talk with the right sort of people. Don't just fell for any tom, dick and pish-posh. Get to know a person first and follow the 5 months no-sex rule. The one who wants to be with you will stay, while others will leave. Have a good life.</h1>
