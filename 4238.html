<p>hihello indians..
one of my friend is very sexy n cute..
he is gym tinned guy..
uptil now i was thinking that he is straight..but now i observed that he looks towards other cute guys while going along the road..
in last week he was in my home for sleeping..
we were alone..in morning i found his leg on my body..
i know its normal between two frnds..
but he msgs me like missing u..like any bf..
does he is gay??
should i test him
or should i tell him about me??
need suggestions</p>
<h1>GCI- Well I have a straight friend and ever since I came here to canada, he says that he has been missing me. There is nothing gay when two guys say that they are missing each other. Straight guys have feelings too, you know. They are not stones at heart.</h1>
