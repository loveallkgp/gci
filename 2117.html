<p>Hey guys. Guys might remember I posted earlier about a guy I met who was treating me like a brother and those of you who replied or commented might remember the jist of the advice. It left me in little doubt that you guys thought I was in a toxic relationship. Well guys what do you think about this development. Yesterday we went to the gym together and he said that he wanted to have a discussion. He said to me that his sister has read some of the text messages between us, now bear in mind non of these messages were not sexually explicit but rather mundane in nature about life i suppose, however it would leave the reader in no doubt at all of the closeness of our relationship. We always sign off to each other with love you bro. His sister said to him that he shouldn't get so close to me and that he should be weary of new people. I admit we have only known each other for about 4 months. I treat his family as my own even to the extent that I have his sisters eid as a brother. His response was a panicked one and said to me perhaps that we should only email each other. I was really offended by this as I had shown nothing but respect for his family. It really pissed me off and I told him in no uncertain terms. I even said I want to speak with his sister and to why they had said this. He wouldn't allow me to do that as he said it would make matters worse and said that if I spoke with them we could no longer be friends. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I asked him to explain his thinking and said why was it acceptable that all your mates could txt him but he was banning me from it. He then accepted that he was wrong to suggest the email thing. I don't really know what to do. I do love this guy. I'm a lawyer by profession and can see thinks in a very objective manner but not when it comes to him. It's really pissing me off</p>
<h1>GCI- Think it from a sane mind. There might be something else going on. Otherwise there would be no reason to make a communication gap between the two of you. Sorry to say, but he is acting kinda scared. If he had really cared for you then no matter what would have happened, he wouldn't have tried to stop his contact from you. Get to know the real reason.</h1>
