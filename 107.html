<p>I am being troubled by a memory. Around 5 months back I met a guy in my city though PR. He is 30 years old. He called me to his home and we went to his room. We did some fun but without fuck. When I was about to go back I saw his picture in other room with a woman. He was married. And also he was a father of a boy. I think he removed his pictures from the room where we were. Now after all this time I'm still feeling guilty because he used me to cheat on his wife. I feel troubled by this thought that I wronged his wife and kid. What should I do admin?</p>
<h1>AdminViv- Honey, you are not wrong at all in this. As you said you didn't know before so the blame doesn't lie with you. He, being married and fathered, was seeking guys for fun, so I do pity them because he is not being loyal to his own kin. So you my dear friend, need not feel guilty at all because its not your fault.</h1>
