<p>Hi Guys,
I just want to tell you all about this guy. He is from Chandigarh, wears a turban, brown eyes, trimmed beard, works in IT field. Hope some of you might have clue whom I am talking about.
He uses people and then leaves them to suffer. He attracts mostly Sikh turbaned guys. Most guys like get fooled by his clever conversation. He promises you a lot more things but actually is just after sex. I was a victim of his manipulations. Now I have heard similar stories from around 4 other guys regarding him. I was not the first and am not the last. He promises a life long relationship but is not interested in anything other than sex.
I had really let it go but after hearing the similar stories from these guys I want revenge. He is married and has a son, though he doesn't explicitly admit it. I was thinking to hire a detective to find his whereabouts and tell his family the whole truth. That would make his life living hell.
I am not that kind of person who holds on to grudges. But the way he treated me made my blood rage.
What you guys suggest.
Regards</p>
<h1>Viv- Its pretty much disgusting, the way people use others. Is there a need to hire a detective? Enough proofs can be gathered by a group of guys who were his victims and then you can mail the stuff to his home. Or you can also think about other ideas as well. These type of guys, they do need a lesson.</h1>
