<p>hello
check check 123 123
okay!
Hello admin
admin I am back from the school. I asked answers of these questions from chaya ma'am. She took the aper and wrote this on my project-</p>
<p>Its good you have taken a different topic. I am a very democratic person, as I teacher of social science I belive that all issues must be under focus when it comes to social science project. I saw the list of questions which you are curious about. You are still in 7th standard, so you can control your curiousity for the time being. Though I will answer some of them
-LGBT society is repressed and alienated. They hide their sexuality and many are forced to marry opposite sex which in turn, causes problems in martial relationship. Gay marriages were accepted in earlier times but no record shows that men or gay men had to commit sati and this seems impossible. Recent studies in sociology do tell us that sometimes children of all gays do better. Gender diesnt matter when it comes to love and parenting. It's possible that there were gay kings but during the time of mughal empire, I think it was impossible for any gay to reveal his sexual identity because islam doesn't support homosexuality . Harrapan script is not yet deciphered so we don't know if there is any mention of LGBT in their tablets. No one is homophobic from birth, it's the homophobic parents and relegion which bows the seed of homophobia in child's mind.'</p>
<p>'you focused on a subject which is rare. You get A'</p>
<p>This are snswers which she give in my paper. Admin I want to ask now, why people are unhappy in comments when I ask quesuons. I still in 7th and my pados wali aunty ka ladka is gay he suggest me these topic and I creted quesions after reserch butt He out if station, I ask qoyson to yoh. Yuh sad 2
why</p>
<h1>GCI- They were unhappy because some questions were really out of the expectations. Men cannot become pregnant because they still are men. Lesbians, yes because they are still women. One cannot guess the mortality rate or the abortion rate of LGBT because no one can guess the sexuality before the birth and right after the birth. Rest of the answers were given by your teacher.</h1>
