<p>I joined a coaching center last year in november and there were really good looking guys but my eyes got struck at a guy who may not be as good looking as other guys in room, and i dont know what happened to him i got attracted to him, A fatal attraction ( we see many guys in metro/college n gt crush on them) bt this one was diff attraction. So i jst started sitting besides him and surprisingly we gt along very well in just short span of time. We use  to hv lunch together, share everything about our families and even he use to left so many metros so that we both can talk more on platform, he use to give me seat in metro n keeps on standing himself. There was a sexual tension b/w us too that i can feel very well. I used to touch his abs in cute way and he seems to enjoy that. Thn i told about it to my one frnd and she use to tease us and he just blushed on it. I dont know about him , he belongs to a village and went there permanently though we r still in touch via social media.  I wished him valentines n he said i was waiting fr ur call only, where were  you? happy valentines 2 u too. I dont know what interference should i draw from this . I just want to be his friend wdout benifits, that we are already bt i want to convey my feelings to him and want him to accept me as his friend as i m :) Is he interested in me? How to tell him about my feelings. He belongs to a village he will nvr acknowledge himself. And its easier to seduce fr one night stand but vry diff for long term. I will lose him if i tell him everything? i jst cant keep it wd myself..
Sorry fr such a long confession.</p>
<h1>GCIL- U need to have a glass of water first of all love!</h1>
<p>Now listen carefully...Of all the things that matter the most the top most thing is that what does he understands of himself and how does he perceive about love between men!
Other points are-
1- He must not be a confused soul.
2- He should be well versed with the gay scene and yet be firm on what does he want from his life.
3- He should know that nothing can be taken for granted and both of u must see ur bond and its growth..bcoz fairy tales romance and shit do not exist anymore like the 19th century.
4- You must understand the fact that this may not work out and it is OKAY ....</p>
