<h1>Viv- I don't think that if you look for your career your sexuality should matter. True that everyone needs "someone" with whom you could discuss everything but there is no need to carry your heart out in the hand and give it numerous people(not specifically to you). You'd be surprised that even 2 gays can be best of friends! And as far as this dual life is concerned, everyone here lives that. But dude! DO NOT think about ending the life! NEVER! That is a cowardly act! Honestly gay life is no reason to suicide! Be brave man! I was bullied and bashed infact in school, but suicide never came in mind. It rather made me brave and taught me how to face the world.</h1>
