<p>Hii .. i'm 20 from Patna</p>
<p>My uncle (28) got married to a girl :P on 9th and while all the wedding ceremonies were going on, weird things were going on in my head .. at time i got emotional thinking that ceremonies like these wont be held for me ever .. I got very sad in the "Baraat" thinking that I wouldn't be able to dance with my granny on my "Baraat" she would be so happy to see me get married &amp; then at other times i was super confused that suppose Gay marriages is legalized in India how would the wedding go .. I mean would it be like two Baraat coming from opposite directions n merging into one ...</p>
<p>Well on the wedding night the Pandit explained the details of a Hindu marriage n he said that wife is called a Dharam-Patni cause without a wife one cannot perform any religious event n even if he does it wont matter n this got me even more sad.</p>
<h1>GCI- IDK about that but some gay couples do have their marriage ceremony with typical Indian traditions. There is always the Church themed wedding option. OR! You can go to a cruise with your future bf and get married on a ship because the captain of a ship has that privilege.. Ain't nothing better than getting married on a ship.</h1>
