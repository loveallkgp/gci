<p>I'm gay and I met this guy and felt that he is made for me.. We both liked each other. Even I almost deactivated my pr account after meeting him
We went to vaishnodevi together, and then I proposed him during the journey. He said that we should not haste. I said fine, take your time. Then his exams came and he started studying seriously. He didn't answer my phone call, I felt very bad. We barely talk for 5 min on phone due to the language barrier, he is from tamil nadu and i'm from delhi so we have to communicate in english. I do understand that he is studying for his exams and even then i felt bad. He smokes and drinks often, and I dont like to be with someone who smokes/drinks. Morever, he never use love words. And I always feel that after completing his studies he will leave delhi and abandon me :/
Should I take him seriously anymore? That exam thing has seriously blown up my mind and I cant take his smoking habits anymore.
Will I ever get someone to marry with or I'll have to grow up alone?</p>
