<p>I was staying in Gurgaon in a PG and after
few months this really cute guy came to stay in my PG.
One day in the mess he sat infront of me and started talking to me.
The moment he opened his mouth, I began to adore him.
He sounded so sweet...He had one of those voices which mesmerizes you.
We spoke to each other for 2-3 days and then within a month he
left the PG. He told me about it before he was going to leave and
the funniest thing was, we didn't know each others name but we were
sort of friends.
I left the PG too and went to work in Bangalore.
I thought about him few times after I had left Gurgaon.
Then I got transfered to Noida. After 7 months in Noida, one day
I was returning from office at 8.30 at night.
I saw a guy from behind speaking to someone on phone just near my new PG.
But I kept on walking and few seconds later someone tapped me on my shoulder.
I turned back and it was him. Because we did not knew each others
name, it was a little awkward.
He said, this might sound weird and I don't know how to say this
to you, but did you use to live in Gurgaon and happen to know me.
I told him I recognized him and then we introduced each other
for the first time and exchanged numbers.
This was the best thing that happened to me lately.
We hang out sometimes and I told him I have a crush on him, he said COOL.
Wasn't weird at all.....Is this Universe or Destiny.
I don't know....but I am really happy the way it turned out and don't want
anything more. Still can't believe  met a person twice in my life....
Thank you God!!!! Keep doing such small miracles for everyone.</p>
<h1>GCI- Ooh the butterflies! Luckily you met a guy who mesmerized you with his voice. Me on the other hand once met a guy who was really good and all but when he opened his mouth for speaking, it scared me. He spoke like Lord Voldemort. -_-</h1>
