<p>"So here is how you beat the bully back
so My final round of placement had concluded and i along with others was waiting for the results the next morning.This was at 12:00 AM in the night.this one guy who is huge and never made past first round of any company decided to take his frustration on me by calling me 'chakka' from someone's else s account. Now this guy(whose fb account was hacked) is very sweet so there is no way on earth he  could have done that. Plus this bully had done similar things in the past. So i gathered all my gali gyan and replied mc,bc  teri maa ki ch<em><em> mein dinasaur ka La</em>d</em>a on fb.
Then i went straight to his room , confronted him , said madar<strong><em>* behen</em></strong>* with such loud amplitude that he was shocked and taken aback. Realizing he could not Out-speak me , He (and remember he is twice my size. my body is too soft and frail :( ) started punching me in the face and i held on his shirt and tore it literally. By that time a big crowd had gathered and did beechbachaov. And when he tried to hit me again one of my friend pushed him back and threatened him with his life with such ferocity that i almost fell for him that instant. Anyways the shocked crowd saw me use some of the words  which they would never expect to hear from me in their wildest dream. 
Needless to say guards were called, warden came to invetsigate In our college everyone is awarded a black dot(sort of punishment that forbids you to use almost all college facilities and your name is displayed on the notice board) no matter  whose fault it is. I said bravely i dont care if i get the black dot cause i know my future is bright and i have been placed. Par uski PHAT GAYI yAAR. he started apologizing instantly.. tere hath padta hun pair padta hun.. everyone saw how this 'mard' who beats up small kids became a 'chakka' when authorities were involved.
he started begging in front of everyone and everyone in my class supporting me against him was a very pleasant surprise. Everyone started making fun of him , about his cowardice .NOone is my class slept that day untill 3:00 AM in the morning
Anyways next morning i was called to the placement division and was informed i was one of the two guys in my class who were placed in that respectable company. all well that ends well i guess. Plus i became a class hero that night :) </p>
<p>"</p>
<h1>gci- Good and a brave effort and congrats for getting placed but please do not use the word chhakka in a derogatory way. You uses it to explain his situation. Next time, don't.</h1>
