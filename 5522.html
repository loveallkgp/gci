<p>I am abroad from the last 10 or so years. I am a retail manager in one of the leading superstore in the country. There is this one customer who came by last night to get something. He saw me and we shake hands. I know him as a customer and that's all to it. He is handsome and would fantasize a lot about him. But I know well enough that nothing is going to happen. So I let those thoughts go. He talked to me for a bit and told me that he is moving to another country for good. He also asked his friend to click a picture of him with me. This was probably the first time we shook hands. Now, I have kind of separation anxiety. The same sort that we have while departing India. He was never more than a customer to me. Never thought I would get so weird afterwards.
It's like first time I have felt so strongly about a person whom I hardly know. I don't even know his name to begin with. Has anything like this happened to anyone? Please share your thoughts. And in the process help me get over it.
Thanks &amp; Regards
DJ</p>
