<p>Dear GCI , Hi. plz dear let all gays know about Canada process. which Visa would be easy to obtain to Enter Canada.. student visa, tourist visa, visitor visa .. how much maximum time Embassy takes to decide the Application.. how much Bank balance u need to show for particular visa catagory and... for how Many days we need to show the Banlance, 30 day, 3 months , 6 months how much effect gives the Sponsership letter, if the visa is in visitor catagory ? If any firm, company, or Personal person provides you for Domestic work permit letter, does it give work effectivly for visa process, And what else Easy way or Simple Visa catagory you think would be comfortable to obtain Canada visa? PLEASE - DONT ADVICE to visit web site.. Because the way you advice in FRIENDLY WAY .. the Web Site will NOT .. Thanks n much love </p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks for guiding me on how to reply. I would have never known.</h1>
<p>Anyways, I'm got here on a student visa so I am gonna write about that. So it goes like first you have to apply to the university. After you get your letter of acceptance you have to apply for the GIC account which is operated by Nova-Scotia bank. In that account you have to deposit 10,000CAD which will be used when you get here. In the mean time you have to pay the first semester fee and apply for CAQ('CERTIFICAT D' ACCEPTATION DU QUEBEC') if you are entering Quebec province. If its any other province you don't need it. You don't have to show any bank balance or anything else for the visa application. Just your GIC account which is a specific procedure made for Indian students, is sufficient.</p>
<p>So that's that.. now im gonna sleep. Cheerio mates.</p>
