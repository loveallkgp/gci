<p>I never thought I'd cry like a bitch for someone in my life. I had crush on a guy the 1st time I saw him. But I never talked to him and I always kept away from him coz I knew he is trouble. But then he was the one who talked nice to me. He was the one who insisted on going out with him. He was the one who constantly kept calling me for sleepovers, he even cuddled and kissed me every time every day. He'd hold my hands so tight all through a movie, I thought the signs were so clear. We saw world together and now when I became so dependent and when he came to know that I'm in love with him he just bailed on me. He doesn't want to see me anymore. He literally raped my emotions and left. I'm feeling so used and broken..</p>
<h1>GCI- And you think that feeling pity on yourself is the best thing that you can do? These are the time of take respect and give respect. If someone doesn't respects you then to hell with him. Just believe that before him your life worked perfectly well, and after him it can be the same if you put some effort in it.</h1>
