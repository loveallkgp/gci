<h1>Viv- You are the right one here because you understood the situation of him having a gf. Its upon him to make a right decision between you and his gf. There's a saying that says, "If you are in love with two people then choose the second one because if you were in love with the first one then wouldn't have fallen for the second one." So maybe he loves you more and it all comes down to him and his choice.</h1>
