<p>plz read this-
Human Rights Watch has had only a few direct
contacts with juvenile prisoners in the course of
research for this report, although it has received
numerous reports about their treatment from other
prisoners, in addition to hearing from some older
prisoners about incidents that occurred when they
were minors. In 1998, the mother of an Arkansas
prisoner contacted Human Rights Watch to report
that her son, a friend of his who was only sixteen,
and a third prisoner were all raped in the same
cellblock in April of that year. Human Rights
Watch wrote to the young prisoner, who was being
held in an adult prison, asking about his situation.
He
responded:
Sorry for taking so long to write, but I have been
having a lot of trouble. I'm 16teen. I got into a
fight and I got a broke bone in my arm. It don't
hurt that bad. Now about the trouble I have been
having. I have had 2 people try to rape me . . . . I
have tryed to go to P.C. [protective custody] but
they wouldn't let me.
In his next letter to Human Rights Watch, R.P.
explained:
When I was in B pod I had 3 dude's coming to
me that said they was the only thing that was
keeping me from getting raped, and they wanted
to jack off and look at me. The pod I'm in now I
had 2 people come to me and put a ink pen to
my neck and tell me that if I didn't let them jack
off on me they were going to rape me. I told the
officer but they didn't do any thing about it.
R.P. never directly said that he was raped but he
has
complained about severe and continuing sexual
harassment from adult prisoners. Prisoners in other
institutions have confirmed that R.P.'s situation is
typical, stating that young prisoners like R.P. are
viewed as more attractive sexually and more easily
abused. A Florida prisoner said:
Mostely young youthful Boy's are raped because
of their youth and tenderness, and smooth skin
that in the mind of the one duing the raping he
think of the smooth skin and picture a
woman . . . . Prisoners even fight each other over
a youth without the young man knowing anything
about it to see whom will have the Boy first as his
property.
An inmate in Nebraska told Human Rights Watch:
The kids I know of here are kept in the hospital
part of the prison until they turn 16. Then they
are placed in general population. . . . At age 16,
they are just thrown to the wolves, so to speak, in
population. I have not heard of one making it
more than a week in population without being
"laid."
As described below, small size is another risk
factor;
small young prisoners are thus especially
vulnerable
to sexual abuse. A Utah inmate told Human Rights
Watch:
[When I was sent to prison,] I was just barely 18
years of age, about 90 pounds. I did nine years
from March 1983 to November 1991. In that 9
years I was raped several times. I never told on
anyone for it, but did ask the officer for
protective custody. But I was just sent to another
part of the prison. Than raped again. Sent to
another part of the prison. Etc.</p>
