<p>Yeah am a gay, but it doesn't mean I don't need respect
N being a gay doesn't mean that I can go for sex with everybody
Then why everyone stare me like anything
I feel insecure n crazy
Wildness surrounds me
Why is it that the men at airport or hotel or at display counter turns to be a bisexual n
Starts approaching like a fucker
Although m little naughty but it's not like that m foolishly bottom
Many times I have asked whereby thy r gay or how many times they had sex with a a guy
And the same reply comes from very second person
Tht I donot like gay sex just had it once or had it with one friend
I mean if they want to have sex with every second guy who looks appealing at their counter then why do all straight cheat n say falsely tht they are not much into sex
The world is full of foolish sex seeking animals
Why dot thy understand if m good looking or gay
It's not compulsory I may have sex with them whenever they want it</p>
