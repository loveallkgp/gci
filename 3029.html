<p>I've fallen in love 7 months ago with a completely different guy. He was calm like water and very charming. Truth be told I've never seen him angry. Im in so love with him. He is working in a MNC office in Gurgaon. Lately he is getting drunk and beats me up. He is having lots of problem in his office and when i ask him what is his problem he refuses to say and when i ask him to stop he abuses me. But at last he calms down and hold me tight while sleeping. Few days ago he hit me really hard in my stomach and i that part had become blue-black. I cried a lot, but after few minutes he came picked me up in his arm and massaged me in the stomach area. Till this day it still hurts. Although after that incident he has become much more docile and doesn't abuse me anymore. I love him very much he is perfect for me. But can i live like with the fear that he would hurt again. Sometimes to be exact when he try to touch my cheeks i just panic from inside. His hands are big and im just a thin teen fallen in love with a beast. Some of them even said that i should satisfy him sexually to control his anger and frustration. Is it true? Although i tried it once he slept like a baby!</p>

<h1>GCI-  And you say he is calm like water. The question here is not how to control him. The question should be that why there is a need to beat you at all? It would have been all okay if he beat you once, realized his mistake and never did that again. But clearly he didn't do that. Love is one side but you cannot compromise on your self respect. You will say that he tries to make it okay later on but making it okay it really doesn't matter if he choose to do it again. If I was in your place, I would have left him.</h1>
