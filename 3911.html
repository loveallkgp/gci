<p>Animesh this side ,19years old gay :) Sharing something funny and interesting that happend with me yesterday :P</p>
<p>I was there at Noida sec 18 around 6:45pm,sitting with one of my friend who likes me.We both were talking normaly then a 10years old child came who was selling-roses,that kid was approching evry couple out there to take his rose,then he came to us as well and asked if we want flower,unexpectdly that guy purchased the rose and gave it to me without giving a damn abt number of couples sitting next/nearby us.People nearby us started staring at us when he gave me the flower and proposed me yesterday with knee-down.Few couples obviously laughed with weird expressions and few gave us a sweet smile and indirectly wishes us by thumps-up and 2 couple  came to us and asked if we two are gay and we told frankly yes we r gay bt not couple bt just friends they wished us gud luck and said we would look gud as a couple.That yeah  child was too sweet he said "Aap dono bahut acche hai bhagvan apki jodi banaye rakkhe"</p>
<p>After sometime another child came who was selling the roses,i dnt discrminate people so he sat nearby us and asked me to give that rose to him(i guss he wanted mine rose in order to sell it n get money in return of it).I told him swtly that i can't give this since it is alread gifted to me by someone.He said who gifted i was hsitated to tell this bt then my friend told that guy swtly that he gifted this to me,that rose-seller's expression was too weird and shocking lol :P and asked us if we two are hijra though we look like a boy so how boy can gift rose to a boy,we must b hijra fooling people around by wearing male clothes and looking handsome like guys(i dnt look good bt the other guy was certainly too gud and cute).So he was in utter confusion of it.I did not feel offended by what he said i did not say nything but said "Beta apko jo samjhna hai samjh lo" bt my guy got angry and was scolding him for using this term.Bt i dnt find Hijra people too bad that if sm1 would call me hijra i should get offended.Like if sm1 would call us Srk hritika or something we take it as compliment so hijra people r too bad or what that we take it as an offense ? i know its about identity but still.</p>
<p>I couldn't stop my laughter after he went thinking abt the whole thing and also the sweet gestures got by 2 couples who  seem to be  LGBT friendly and had deep interest knowing about us but couldn't interact much due to time-issues.But i find this realy good that in the same place i got people who blessed us and at the same place and time got few people whp laughed at us.Would not say nything about kid since they r unware of sexualties gender-identity and all.It was overall very happening day for me and it was something first time i experienced such thing.I m too shy and hesitant when it comes to do this thing bcz i think too much about others nearby me bt the guy was too fearless may be bcz he is Haryvani jaat who is known to be out-spoken and fearless =D :P</p>
