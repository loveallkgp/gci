<p>Sushant is the hot gossip of the day.</p>
<p>Nothing much to say about him. My opinion is simple, he must not act like the way he is. At our home, school and even in college, our family and teachers teach us that we should act good and be good at every time. They teach us how to react and behave in front of everyone. And yeah, this is not a right way what he is doing. It is creating a bad impact. When we say we should not change anyone, let the person be how he actually is. Then we should not think to change our society as well. Let the society be the same. But no, we should adopt good and avoid bad. But what the guy is showing is worst. So simply he must have some class and should not behave like a baby doll. </p>
<h1>GCI- Toooo fucking much contricted views. Let me deal with it point by point.</h1>
<p>He must not act the way he is. Then how should he act like in a fake way? Then you people will be the first to say "oh he is so fake" and shit like that.
At school we learn about etiquettes and manners. The behavior comes from within. As an educated person you should know the difference.
Why the society should not be changed? I lost you at that point. If we let the society be same then by God's grace, India will surely flourish to the pit because there are an awful lot of people who just know how to make life of others difficult. </p>
<p>Let people be. The society needs to change. The thinking that you have, needs to get changed. Charity begins at home. Tick tock!</p>
