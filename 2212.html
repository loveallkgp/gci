<p>Hey guys i am Gay,i am not so goodlooking so people make distance with me .people has told me many bad things,so painful,and many people left me because of my looking....but i got more inspire by this all activities,the inner spirit came out,there grew up the thinking that no boy you should grow up and show them who you are coz you have talent....i think i have talent i can sing well,dance well,draw well,cook well and etc etc....some are got by natural and some are got by practise,so i want to be a big star and want to show them who i am...and one day im gonna tell them who i am....but there is a problem that i cant sing other song perfectly...i can sing english POP song,its my genere and i want to be the singing star of hollywood...is that possible friends to be a star in hollywood?i personally think if u do hard labour then success we come after you....so i believe in hardwork suggest me friend....i want your suggetion....i want to show these all holy fools that who i am and what can i do....comment plz...thank y</p>
<h1>GCI :  everything is possible .....you need dedication , hardwork and talent .,, bit of luck .  Freddie Mercury was indian , frida pinto was a normal girl who tried into modeling ..finally ended up into hollywood . best of luck ...</h1>
<p>but don't do it to show somebody else . .. if you wanna do something make sure you are doing it for yourself . there is no need to prove yourself to anybody . but sure keep their hatred as fuel to your journey .</p>
