<p>Hi to all.I just wanted to share my love story  which ended in vain.It started at the age of 16.I created strange feelings on men.Started searching pics of men and I found about gaydia.in. I created a profile there.then only I found there are lot of people lyk me and I m not the one. After getting into the site I met a unknown guy and lost my virginity with him.after that incident I was so feared and deleted my profile.during my 11th std holidays,again I opened a profile there.Giving random messages,getting random phone numbers.First tym I felt a spark with a guy called santosh.He spoke nicely in phone.he is a IT guy,staying in the city for work alone.we met,went outings and had fun.soon he became more closer to me and he wanted me to delete my profile and be with him.That's where the argument started.lot of fights between us.After all fighting I deleted my profile..3 years I ve been with him. He spent lot of money on shopping,outings etc. In between these 3 years I was caught red handed by him lot of times by keeping fake profiles in gaydia. Days passed..we became lyk true lovers.we both had mutual fun without anal.He loved me truly and me too did the same.After I joined college he got married. He totally cut my relationship. Blocked my number.I don't know what to do.My dream castle just fallen apart.I just kept calm.last week he called me and said his wife went to her native.I went to meet him.He was totally drunk.The character which I saw in him for the past three years had gone.he treated me lyk a slave.within 10 min I got out from his place.cried like anything.Now I am just alone and thinking my past days..don't know how long I am supposed to live like this.I have no feelings on girls. I think again I m going to land on gaydia.in </p>
