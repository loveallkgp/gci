<p>Hi. I'm a 24 year old guy. Still virgin. It all sounds good that you should not be sex seeker and all. But i've this strong desire to have sex with a top guy. Their Profiles where i can be sure they ve posted their real semi nude pics and ve asked to suck their cocks make me full of desire. I can not seek anyone. First reason is it's considered bad you know. 2nd is i'm actually a bit afraid of top guys. I tell my friends i'm versatile. But my bottom feelings far outweigh my top feelings. Once in a while, a rather twinky cute facial hairless guy turns up and it twitches at third base, front. But mostly it's rear. I feel like i wanna begin being bottom. Eventually my desires will be more like to penetrate than to be penetrated but then when i ve been satisfied enough by top men i'm sure of that i'm gonna switch roles or be a sure verse. But right now all i wanna do is to be penetrated and suck cock but i find it scary. I know and you can be assured of it that i'll never seek them out of fear and social pressure. Never will i've a sex date in my life. Maybe it will happen when i'll land up with a boyfriend and i dont think i'll be lucky enough to ve a sure top, or perhaps it'll never happen. But i wont ask for sex howso ever much i want to, even though some guy asks for it and seems mature enough to have sex with. My confession is I know i ll never sleep around with a hot muscular boy but it does not mean i dont want to. Why should i hate it? I despise that i've not the sexual freedom to celebrate my sexuality as bottom. What i've to take care of when i'm not sleeping with straight men, the greatest reason for misconception about gays being sex maniacs? [I'm talking about willing a top but pure gay man who is not sadistic or insensible towards my desires.] What i've to do about STDs if I use full protection? With a guy who is single like me. I think i should ve the freedom as a single person to have sex with someone who is single if i wanna lose my virginity. But the social mirror is so bad that i dont even tell my friends that my strong desire at the moment is to be a pure bottom for a hunky muscular guy. To melt by his warm body on bed. :( </p>
