<h1>Viv- Well, this is certainly ridiculous that gay people have to first fall in love, then have to swear on the lifetime companionship, but then have to marry a girl under the pressure. If you know the truth that you will get married to a girl someday, then just hump around and be done with it. Feelings are not effing toys to play with.</h1>
<p>I'm so sorry buddy. I know what you must be going through. But don't loose your head. Trust me, it will be good to forget him no matter how hard it is. He sacrificed the love but you really must not sacrifice your career. Try not to think about it. And do not be a sidekick to him. His wife will be his priority now. All the best.</p>
