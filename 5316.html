<p>Hey Lads , this is my First confessions !
I got to know about this Page Yesterday and I Kinda explored it for Hours and I seriously think that people out here Genuinely Helps Each other and Specially Admin , You are Highly Sarcastically Helping Ass !!
.
.
So Here's an Expressing Of Emotions u can say , Not a confession particularly.
So , I belong to a Family Who are very Famous in Bollywood and Hollywood both as em Indian American ! Dad Famous in indian Fashion world and Mom in international Show Biz .. So being from such Family its Quite hard to accept the Harsh reality that you can share with World that You"re Gay !
I mean in spite of knowing that many Gays work under my Mom Dad but Still my Parents Taunts me that <em>We are lucky that we don't have a Gay Son</em> which just makes me quite obnoxious because that's something which I fear of.
Em way too Happy Being Gay , I don't Regret on my way of living but I really wish that My mom dad accepts me !
When ever on Facebook I make Gay friends , It always Leads on -ve Back fire on Me ! Due to facing Many Bad experiences , People tend to Use me !
Lemme share my lil experience with you Peeps ..
This is somethin 3 Months Old , I added a Friend on my <em>GayFacebookId</em> and he seems to be Nice and Classy enough to carry chat with , so ya . Days passed and we became good friends !
I never share my Personal life with any gay friend bcs I fear the Market of my Parents reputation , so I keep my life as a secret but this time I got lil Lame and overwhelmed that I told him about Myself that my Mom and Dad are these people , he was kinda very shocked and after knowin these things he kinda changed and started demanding things and Lame of me that I started giving ..
Day came , he asked huge amount of cash and I denied and that resulted in Huge blackmailing and till now I am being Blackmailed !
I don't know why I did so , I regret on my some Decisions !
I really don't know what to do ?
Em Strong enough to handle him alone but I do care about my Families Image !
Its like , I have met every star till date and my Mom Dad have worked Hell hard to achieve this Stage !
So yeah ! Its kinda Bad times for me !
I don't know how will it Result ..
May b Suicide ? <em>_</em>
Hell No , I aren't that weak Pussy haha ..
I'll Handle Mentally or Physically but ya I know that Fag will pay his Karma xD
And
Bdw Bdw em 17 ( in next two months) haha xD
P.s : I know its not Shaddi.com hahaha ^_^ </p>
<h1>GCI- Damn gurl, you got some high reputation and obviously a very nice stand. Use it for a purpose maybe? You got the potential for it and it could be easy for you. You will not be always dependent upon your parents. Take sensible steps and people around you will be proud of you.</h1>
