<h1>1 25 % are here just to fullfill there physical desires . Either they are divorcee or unmarried .</h1>
<h1>2 50 % cant procced further in relationship after a certain age of 25 and above as they were forced to marry a Girl or boy.</h1>
<h1>3 10% are those who wish to get married on their on choice but due to social life they can't</h1>
<h1>4 5% are those who are child abuse victims</h1>
<h1>5 9% are those who are sexually assaulted in their family by cousins or step parents .</h1>
<h1>6 1% only dare to live there relationship on themselves beyond any either By Running out from there homes or By Anything else.</h1>

<h1>GCI- Please don't use this page as a grandstanding for the political motives. We need dialogue around the country so that people are aware everywhere. This happened once before when there were elections in Maharashtra where some MLA posted a confession here about how BJP keeps the interest of LGBTs in consideration and till now we haven't heard anything positive about it. Time for words is gone. I guess we need something real time solutions.</h1>
