<p>I am in a relation with a guy since 2 year. We love each other a lot. But he is married with one kid. He says he was forced to marry due to family problems. He does not treat his wife badly and even has sex with her sometimes. Now trouble is that he wants me to get married too. He said if I stay single then people will suspect I am gay and then he will also get exposed if he hangs with me. But i dont like girls at all. I don't know what to do.</p>
<h1>GCI- He made a mistake, that shouldn't be your decision for your life. You are in love with him, okay. Where will you be after next 5 years? Maybe in the same position where you have to be each other's secret.</h1>
<p>What does he care about? His own image that he shouldn't be exposed. That's why he wants you to get married too. The question here arises that will you be happy if you agree with him? It's sometime hard to think about future in the heat of the moment where everything appears to be fine. But sometimes for your own mental health you have to think beyond and from your brain. Think for yourself. This loss will not matter.</p>
