<p>confessing here after a long tym...
21 i am..there is this thing happened with me yesterday....i couldnt get it out of my mind...</p>
<p>i have never carved for sex...i did sometimes oral sex wth people (3 dates till nw) but at end of it i dont feel anything special...few months ago i realize sex is not what i need in my lyf on priority basis..i carve for a relationship...so i changed my profile..altered it completely...few days ago there is this guy who asked me for a date at a particular hotel...i went there met him...he was nice, funny, cute...i liked him..while having tea he told me that the hotel we r sitting in is owned by him only(it was shocking as hell!!)...he gave me a visit to complete hotel...it was perfect date i have always imagined...we started having late nights chats, calls...i asked him day before yesterday tht i would like to date him...like official dating..! he said yes...i was on cloud 9...i was feeling happy...i was soo much positive abt him and me..</p>
<p>yesterday morning he came to my house...i was alone...we both were having good conversation...i wanted to kiss him...but was feeling shy...so i texted him tht i wanted to kiss u...eventually he pulled me closer and we had kiss...obviously we didnt stop there...while we were making love(or shall i say i was making love)...at tymes he just stops doing everything...lie on bed...put bth his hands on his head..nd just stay so fr few mins...nd then suddenly become active again...i feel as tht if he is feeling guilt of something...but i was confused...i mean i didnt forced him...it happened for few times...finally he cum...i was surprised enough tht he didnt thought abt my satisfaction at all..he lie dere wth me for few mins...eyes closed..hands on head...suddenly he got up says tht he is having acute headache..nd wants to leave so he can sleep...i didnt stopped him..while he was going i asked him..how did he feel after whatver we had...he told me tht he will txt me abt it and went...nothing come from his side than..i txted him in the evening..asking abt his headache...and ans to my previous ques...and then he told me tht he is not happy wth what he did, coz he realized tht having sex wth men is not his cup of tea...and tht it was his first encounter wth a man and will nvr do it again...he was feeling guilty while we were doing it...!! </p>
<p>i didnt said him anything...he was saying sorry...saying sorry tht he did ruined my mood...and tht he should not have started...i simply said...its ohk no probs at least i helped you in finding something abt yourself...had few more chats...and we end our call..</p>
<p>now here i am..couldnt stop thinking abt it...it feels soo bad... when i was genuinely hoping for something...i dont know if it was right or wrong at his end..but it breaks me...i feel as tht if i m being "used"..... i know after few days i will move on..might be will nvr step in tht hotel again...its just tht i wanted to talk abt it with someone badly..so i posted it...</p>
<p>pls guys never...never plays wth someone's emotions...and guys dont judge me by saying tht i m just 21..why am i looking fr relationships soo early...you guys dont know me much..:)</p>
<h1>GCIL- UR age and last para says it all...</h1>
