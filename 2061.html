<p>Hi guys,
I want to thank the admin for such a creative idea to have this page.
Hatred is more prevalent than tolerance in this world. There is an incident I would like to share. Me and my bf were in an Indian Resturant here in UK. It's quite popular place. We were there to celebrate a friend's B'day. He was blowing candles and I don't know why my partner kissed me on the cheeks. Manager was really furious about that. I noticed it later when my friends pointed out. We were there to have some fun. So, we planned to have a dig on him. I asked my partner to kiss me again but this time on the lips. He did and to my utter surprise the manager came over to us and asked us to leave. There were cops and what not. Whole chaos.
The point is Sick Indian Mentality exists here in UK as well. If they can't let it go here in a foreign land I can't even imagine how difficult it must be in India.
Be brave guys. Remember : Rome was not built in a day.</p>
<h1>GCI- Of course the law maybe on the side of the LGBT people in the countries where its all legalized but still the mentality of people takes time to be changed. And the mentality of Indian people has to take a lot of time to get changed. Like a lot lot.</h1>
