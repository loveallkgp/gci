<h1>Viv- Calm down, calm down.. First of all, tone down the figments of your imagination. You are thinking a bit too much. These "what if" words create a hell lot of trouble when there is none. Come on! You are just 18. You are gonna have a series of emotions for the next 4-5 years and you are already troubled? Instead of thinking upon "you don't want to leave your parents", or "you want to live with him", have you thought about making your own life? Get a bit practical and stand on your own feet first and when you both are equal, then try to move on with him.</h1>
