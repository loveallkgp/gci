<p>I come to this often mainly to hook up with guys in comments section. But i want to post for first time since recently i notice lot of confusion about married gays. Most guys here are teens and dont understand real world. Have u really met any single guy in india over 30. Very rare and mostly only pansy gays who cant hide their gayness from public stay single. So guys if u r straight looking u must get married or there are lot of problems from society culture and family. Best is to get married to a poor and religious girl from ur small town without dowry. Then after u have kids u can have sex rarely and she wont complain. You can then have sex with gays on the side. I am married for 9 yrs and am very happy with this setup. So dont worry about anything</p>
<h1>gci- jabber jabber bullcrap... shut up.. looks like you have lost every amount of self conscious. Its NOT a solution at all. You and your regressive views are not required here.</h1>
