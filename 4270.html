<p>I don't know if this is right forum to ask this -</p>
<p>I fear I suffer from excessive compulsive masturbation.. (3-5 times everyday).. Anyone has any experience / idea about this .? is it too bad.? or is it okay.?</p>
<p>I have come to terms about my sexuality about 6 months ago and I have felt very better about acknowledging being attracted to guys (Yeh acknowledging/accepting gave the first good feeling..!!). I used to ignore / avoid / bury / any likes towards guys. But eventually I have understood myself and slowly on the path to come out to the friends &amp; family (closeted so far.)</p>
<p>So about this masturbation - I used to do it almost daily since around 15 or so. Fantasies were about some other couple / or while watching porn - NOT including myself in the fantasy. But now at the age of 22 - that I have understood about my sexuality - I can imagine myself so well in the fantasies and suddenly boosted my masturbation. It has become like an addiction / compulsive behavior for me. A day or two I may control - but it keeps coming back. And I don't think it is good for 22 old guy to be mad about kid's thing. At this age - once in day / some times in week should be okay but what I m doing is too much. It is harming mentally (and may be physically ?????). Rather I should stop wasting time over it and get myself to more productive work.</p>
<p>I won't deny that I do get depressed and lonely at times. Worried about future - family marriage pressures - distraction from career focus etc.</p>
<p>NO PR dates.. NO partner.. For now - Good being single..having multiple crushes..likes.. along with understanding myself.. stabilizing myself..etc.. I have got a long way to go.. :)</p>
<p>Can someone here advice.? Should I really look medical doctor or psychiatrist etc..?</p>
