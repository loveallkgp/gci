<p>I don't know what to say but I am failing miserably in my personal life.My parents left each other when I was quite young and all the time I used to see this hatred in a relationship.I used to love a guy who turned out to be a straight best friend.Never really got a chance to love him.I am now struggling to fit the standards of so called model of socializing with people.People don't want me as their friends and my close ones are already not available much.</p>
<p>I never understood why even after being a nice son,being a scholar for the last five years and even after valuing the term "relationship".I never really succeeded in getting self-less affection in life.I guess there is something extremely wrong with me which makes the people to dislike me.</p>
<h1>Viv- You get hurt because you let others hurt you. Those judgmental people have never gone through anything like you. Don't be ashamed of it and wear all those insecurities like an armor. Be proud of the lessons and experiences life gave you and let them make you mature. That way no one can harm you one single bit.</h1>
