<p>Life has never been that easy from the time I came out to my parents, cousins, friends. It is not that I am suffering from the pain of social and family stigma for being what I am, it is simply because I came out to most of of them at that very moment when I discovered my sexuality, when I discovered that I had downfall towards same sex.</p>
<p>Like every teenager I started a quest for love among my crushes. It was unfortunate that the ones whom I fell in love with were counted to be my best friends, one from my school days while the second one is from my college itself, and unfortunately both are Straights. I am still in love with my college waala buddy. I care for him like anything and share all my happiness and sorrows with him. And he does too. And he knows that I am Gay, for ofcourse I myself told him this a year back during my II Semester. He is absolutely fine with it. But I am absolutely not fine with the feelings that I imbibe in myself for him. It hurts so badly whenever he lies to me about any of the silliest things which are not a big deal to hide about.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that for the next 2 and a half years of my college life I would not be able to resist loving him but I certainly fear that these damn shit sentimental thoughts of mine are adversely puttimg impact on my stuidies.And despite knowing all this, I just cant help myself coming out of this unbreakable four-walls of fucking love for him.</p>
<p>Because When You Fall In Love For Someone, You Perhaps Do Not Enquire His Sexuality At First. Rather The Shit Happens And You Acknowledge It Later When Its Too Late... when its too late!</p>
<p>$$ABBY : you know i too fell in serious love with my str8 class fellow in 11th ... it really made me a loner person coz i couldn't tell him ,,.. though we used to smile at each other still i knew he was str8 coz in 2nd sem of class 11 i found out he likes the girl in the same class . i stopped talking to .. to anybody ... in 12th situation got worse as i used to go to school only to look at him .. he won't come one day ... i will not go to school next 2-3 days ..and believe me i felt so lonely , i used to cry , anyhow 12th ended and we went to college . i tried my best ... made some 'goals' and moved on . its been 4-5 yrs i still remember  him but i don't want him anymore ... you know why </p>
<p>( BECAUSE HE IS STRAIGHT AND LOVES A GIRL AND THAT IS HIS RIGHT TO BE WITH ONE HE ALSO LOVE ) </p>
<p>SO PLEASE Don't be a kiddo and understand that crying doesn't help .</p>
