<p>I m 24 years old guy
I hv mature frnd he is from chennai 
But we r frnd since last 4 to 5 years but never met ...but he came to city of my state which is 350 km far from my city he came on this 6th .i thought we r frnd obviously i was not for any love relationship but i had some attraction towards him ..it was for heart not for my lower part of body.
When he came to my state i went to meet him i had to travel 350 km by train it was very tiring journey 
When i reached to him.i was suffrng frm severe headache ....
But when i came to his hotel after bath he starts trying to do sex with me but i told him about my headache nd i thought because of it i  was retaining my erection ...he gave me pills nd i slept after some time  when i woke nd again he was trying to do sex with me this time i was able to do penetration nd i did so ...i fucked him he sucked me  but strt of a new day he went to his home town and he is keep ignoring me.i atleast i do think so .he is stop sending me msg on whatsapp .facebook nd yahoo 
Do u think its because of sex which we didnt do that....
Is it the most important thing??</p>
<h1>GCI- Dear u just had a good fuck buddy around the corner..dont get mentally attached..bcoz some people love u only to the extent of using u! Their love actually ceases when the benefit is over...chill and have a time for ur self..u dot need to be with guys like him until and unless u really want to !</h1>
