<p>Hi,
I am very confused at the moment. I am gay and in the closet. I don't know if ever would be able to come out. My parents are forcing me to get married. The pressure is so much that I sometimes have to gasp for air. Recently I met a female online and she is up for MOC. I think it is a good option. But the problem is that she is about 10 years older than me and is totally different from me. It's like trditional vs trendy. 
My parents would take it really hard if I decide to come out. My father would never like the idea of having a gay son. I would like to spend my life with a guy but if I go ahead with MOC then I would have to stuck with it for the rest of my life.
I just want your advice on this. Should I go ahead with it or not. I would really appreciate it because I have no one else with whom I can share this.
Thanks 
Peace :)</p>
<h1>GCI- ITS really an honour to answer such confessions..well dear there are many things to consider and reconsider-</h1>
<p>1- What is that u r afraid of???Family.....society..people...or URSELF???
2- If u earn and are financially independent then what is there for so much to be pressurized of??..we are also indian and live in the same era..but I dont feel pressurized...REASON- i have accepted myself and i know about myself that what kind of future i WANT TO CREATE....have u thought about urs??
3- If u always live according to others' perceptions and opinions ..u are a no better than a prisoner...even u r alive doesn't make a difference..
4- MoC or marriage of convenience are for those who can actually carry on with their fake lives and keep on having men on their bed secretly and thrive on man-mongering..if u  are one of those....u r free to take any step.
5- Did ur parents choose ur sexuality and ur gendr or even ur thoughts and personality???If not then y so much of duty sensibility towards them???With due respect' they are also humans not any super natural entity'.
6- If u have NOT accepted urself or cant make ur parents understand about gayism..there is no point in lecturing u or suggesting u anything..bcoz that will end up in the 'BARAAT KA MANDAP'.
7-If u really want suggestions make sure u act on the things which really needs to be done otherwise just go and live ur hoax and a life of a lie..bcoz that will just add to ur hollowness of the soul..</p>
<p>G-LUCK AND GOD BLESS!
P.S - One of my friend died this month and he was gay..no one knew about him...and he was the only son! (dont try to give me the only male child shit...my ex and many gay frnds are the same and many of them are open to their parents)</p>
