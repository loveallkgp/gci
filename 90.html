<h1>AdminViv- a long read but worth reading. Dude if you do get into a relation with him just keep it friendly. All the best to the both of you. Friendship indeed is priceless.</h1>
<hr>
<p>i met him like 3 years ago in a gay dating site, he was (and is) the typical boy-next-door type, sweet, caring, adorable guy. we started to hang out often, in fact very often than any gay guys do. but the fact that it was less of sex and more of friendship was something that surprised me.
i used to be a guy fast to crushes, it was stupid but anyone being nice to me was at a risk of being my crush. and there, i had a crush on him too. but i never showed it (as far as i know). but he always read my mind and read this too. but he was sceptical about it, he never believed in gay relationships back then and he started showing signs that he was not up for a gay relationship. i was totally cool with it, cos we both valued our friendship. and so he went on to to be my best friend and i know that he too considered me the same. and i started to be more mature about relationships. i went on to date another guy, he also knew the guy and was happy about it.
since a year or so, something (maybe seeing my ""perfect"" relationship) made him think about gay relationships in a different way, he had a relationship with a guy, i was happy for him and did support him in the best way possible. it did go on well for a long time, meanwhile i had issues with my guy and we broke up and after a few months or so he too started having issues with his guy and eventually they too broke up. i felt sorry for him and was like consoling him, but he said that he was happy being single. i was relieved to hear that. but what he said next was a surprise, he said that if he ever felt that he needed a relationship, he would propose me.
these were the words i longed to hear from him a couple of years ago. but i am a lot different now, our bonding has changed to become very strong. i've had my share of gay relationships and i know how it goes. the point is that i can let his romantic feelings for me spoil the priceless friendship that we have. i have a feeling that he would understand and can relate to what i feel. but if he doesn't, and plans on keeping a distance from me, that would create a void in me that nobody else can fill.
i've told him once that i love him even more than my boyfriend, so i dont want him to reduce to my boyfriend, cos he s lot more than that. i love him</p>
