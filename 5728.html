I chose the second.. Coz i didn't wnt to take risk.. As i was nt knwing about his sexualty.. Bt i had always seen him staring at me.. Even i used 2 do the same.. He didn't even had a girl frnd in his skul days.. Nd he used 2  stare at me.. Soo i asumed dt he liked me 2.. Bt i wasn't confirm i didn't made a move.. Nd like dis classes were over.. We gave our exam's.. He went 2 other town 4 his further studies.. I remained in same town nd did my +2.. I haven't seen him 4 last 2 yrs.. There is a regret dt i have lost sumthing precious.. Still i look into his fb acount.. Jst 2 see wht's going in his life.. The more i try 2 forget him the more i stared loving him.. Coz of dis all.. I didn't even studied nycly in my +2.. I even tried 2 move on.. I even made a boyfriend bt.. It was jst 4 name sake.. I wasn't able 2 love him.. I was n't able 2 hug him with dt fellingss.. I knew dt i still love my crush nd m nt able 2 get over him.. Sooo i thought 2 end dis relationship.. Bt i thought how can i hurt a guy who loves me soo much.. Bt i was wrong he was such a jerk he jst needed physical satisfaction.. Bloddy loser..nd thankgod i got i got a reason 2 end dis relationship.. Bt i still love my crush.. My one nd only Ag.. Sometimes i feel whatever be the consequences.. I shuld confront my love 2 my crush.. Bt again my mind says wht if he ll be st8.. Nd exposes me  infront of all our mutual frnds and blaaa blaa..

Till i dont forget him.. I won't be able 2 move on in my life.. Plzz help me!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Next time if u confess with that horrible english which i edited before posting..i m not gonna answer u!</h1>
<p>On a serious note u have 3 things to consider-
1- What exactly do u want from ur life??
2- What is the kind of life u wanna create??
3- What is the first and foremost important thing to you...BEING HONEST WITH YOURSELF OR LIVING A LIE???</p>
<p>If u can answer these u have the answer within u..if not then ur love or platonic feelings for that guy will get buried with u when u die..
Personally i feel u must know the person before speaking ur heart out and if things go against u....atleast one confidant must know about ur feelings for someone...it unburdens the heart!</p>
