<p>m agree wid ur suggestion that gives inspiration to many ppl... Bt i want to tell u dat u should not to advice ppl fr random meeting or for having sex wid other person jst to fed up of their past.
If sex is d ultimate solution den no one have regret of loosing their partner.
U hav a lot of fan or say ur lovers
All of this page member appriciate ur thought .... So if u guide ppl to control their sexual desires n all d thing that against loyality
Just try to make dis community also as a normal one.
U hav d power... N i think u should not only solve d problem of this ppl but also try to giv n take idea for betterment of our community.
Asvice to b loyal 
I jst want to tell dat ... Do something that change d view of society for gay</p>
<p>$ABBY : we always mention things like that ... we always advice not to make it all about just sex. but one can't change the reality ( gay world has good and bad people and so does the so called normal ones ( your straight people) have too bad and good sides . instead of making it look so good will be a big fake ... its like putting concealer on your face to hide imperfections.... i don't want to put concealer... you want it you do it. again ' sex isn't sin ' ..</p>
