<p>Background: 23/M/Student, Gradually I have started accepting my attractions for males. Although I am not quiet sure about gay / bi (which only time will tell), I am acknowledging my interests openly within myself. So far, only a few of my close friends (who are not in my college) know about my this state and are somewhat supportive to the same.</p>
<p>Query/Confession:</p>
<p>I feel like I am in love with one guy in my class. I don't know whether it is just crush / liking / love / infatuation... Help me with it, how should I deal with this situation !!!</p>
<p>He is very very sweet that it is very hard not to like him. I just like everything about him and cannot avoid stalking him whenever I get chance. He is good for all - whether his voice, smile, laugh, eyes, touch, his hair, his physique, innocence, shyness, courage, his anger, his sadness, - I cannot describe my feelings in words may be. Feelings have grown gradually over a couple of years. He is a good friend of mine. Sadly, he has interests in girls.</p>
<p>Over last couple of months, I wanted to come out to a friend here in college but I am reluctant. I wanted to come out to this friend also but it seems very risky.</p>
<p>Does these feelings have any future (at least may I confess to him) ? rather I should just move on and ignore / forget / get rid of him out of my mind/heart however difficult it may seem....
Should I confess my feelings for my friend - to him or someone else.?
Should I be first sure about whether i am gay / bi before taking any step.?</p>
<h1>GCI- My my my an ocean of emotions! All this time I hate Katy Perry's Teenage Dreams going on in my head. He is straight honey. All you can do is look at him while he walks away. But you will love the sight of him walking away. <em>HMPH</em></h1>
<p>No matter how good and kind he is or whatever, having feelings for a straight guy can never be healthy for you. Sometimes physically(what if he punches) and mostly emotionally(he will deny you and can tell others). So watch your steps before you bury them in shit.</p>
