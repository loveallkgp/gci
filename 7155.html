<p>Hello friends. I am 24 and a gay like you. I just want to warn you about open gays. Its very risky to be involved with them. I had relation with such guy who used to go to pride and used to talk about gay rights and all. Biggest mistake of my life. I clearly told him I am closet and will marry by 26 age. So want to be in love in secret only and not be seen in public with a openly gay man. But he soon starting asking for favors like wanting to see movie or dinner with me. I tried to break off but he said he will tell my family about me. Luckily I had some naked pics of him which I said I will put it online. He got scared and left me. Guys don't get involved with such openly gay people. They always force you to be gay in public. Have sex with closet gays or married guys only.</p>
<h1>GCI- To u I have two very important things to say.</h1>
<p>1- U were in love with a superficial bitch fapping and boasting about gay shit who was the same dickhead with all the dino pooh u have brushed and collected in ur mind as a gay man.</p>
<p>2- If u ever come back on this page again with ur shitty shit, trust me all my obloquial wrath is gonna burn ur ass and ur dick will deplete like it was never born as that extra organ with ur balls cum no balls.</p>
<p>P.S- The leader moron! what the heck is gay in public?!</p>
