<p>i guess this is not a confession but my life story might be a long one so bear with me.</p>
<p>when i was 7 y/o one of my elder cousin(Mr: Y) started molesting me( my heart goes out to everyone who has suffered this kinda truama i know how bad it is). i used to have mixed feeling about it. Dint understand wether i liked it or not he even abused me in front of his friends and they laughed at what he was doing. so this continued till i was 14 when because of some family problems both our families stoped talking. still confused on whats right and whats wrong. then after a couple of year when i was 16 i had this friend(Name Mr.A) actully he was my best friend. i dint know what lead to this but we started enjoying eachother's company and then one thing lead to another we started sleeping together. still dint know what this was wether this was love or what this contunie for a couple of years and then my moved out of the state (i am from Goa) for his further studies while i decided to persue my further in Goa itself.i was 18 at the time so for the next couple of years i dated girls and decided to hide away all my previous abuse and everything i kind of put a mental block to thoese memories. but once in a while i used to think about MR.A and it used to bring a smile on my face but we never really got back together but i used to miss him and miss spendin time with him.fast forward 3 years down the line and couple of realtionship with girls i meet this guy online (Mr.V) similar taste in music we liked all the same TV show's (HUGE GAME OF THRONES FAN) so we became friends and after 6 months of friendship he actully asked me out and i said yes. we were happy together and enjoying our life  this went on for 18 months and we were in the process of moving out of state and go to Mumbai and get a job there and live there togther since i already had a place there  and suddenly i got an oppturnuity to go abroad for work and now i was in a real delima wether i reject the job and stay with my Mr.V or i take the job offer and see where things lead. i told all this to Mr.A and he encouraged me to take the job offer and with great pain i took the job offer and moved abroad and we decided to give long distance a try. but after 3 months we learnt that with the time difference and everything it was difficult for us to make the longdistance work so we decided to call it quits. so for the next year or so we kept in contact but not much because we dont wanted the other person to move on and not dwell on things. In december 2013 Mr.V suddleny out of the blue sent me a text on BBM sayin that he had got a job in  same city as me and he was moving there in January (First thing i asked him was if he was still single and he said he was). Fast forward present day we both live togther and cudnt be happier.</p>
<p>And Thats a  WRAP folks. hope u read through the whole thing.</p>
<p>PS a few things i Noted 
1). There's no "TOP" or "BOTTOM" in a relationship if u truly love eachother then these two terms dont exist.
2). Recently have read a lot of abuse towards the "GIRLY" guys. to all of ya'll who abuse them  FUCK YOU. Do something better with your life then comment on other     people's life choices.
3). All Bi-sexual guys arent looking just to sleep around some of them are genuine guys.
4). Huggs and kisses to the ADMIN. Fucking awsome job man. HIGH FIVE :P</p>
<h1>GCI : good thoughts. and again we all have different lives and we shall be ready for all the adventures life bring to us. live truly with heart . don't give up and leave the hatered for fellow gay guys for being feminine or bisexual . if you want to accepted by society .. make sure you also give acceptance to others who are part of the same society you live in</h1>
<h1>NO #HATE .</h1>
