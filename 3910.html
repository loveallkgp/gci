<p>Wanted to write my love confession but after seen this #3868 from my real id mind changed :(. For the 1st time I have written a confession So,
When I was in class 12th, the only dream I had was to get admission in AIIMS Delhi. I appeared for four entrances(AIIMS, JIPMER, AIPMT n Assam CEE) and cracked all of them. Unfortunately, getting a lower rank in AIIMS entrance crashed all my dreams to get admission in AIIMS Delhi. It was just 10 ranks distance to get into there, I got AIIMS Bhopal. The hardest time I had ever faced at that time to select the college becoz I belong from Northeast. My father forced me 2 take admission in Guwahati. Reason was , at that time people from northeast were racially discriminated in Delhi, only the negative type newses came to here. But GMCH was not on my choicelist at all. The best city with best college I wanted to select. JIPMER is too far from Assam, though it was 2nd best medical college in India, I really didn't want to go there. Option left only to select college through AIPMT and finally squared up with MAMC Delhi. During entire time, my father has been on edge, I really felt insecure seeing my father saying not to go north with a fragile mind. One of my UP friend told me dt I shouldnt go there n a guy from Mumbai told me"come to mumbai, yaha paani se leke bijli 24 hours rehti h, north mae crime bagera ka rate bohot high h"  . So guys, the fear has come to every parents (as well as to us) from Northeast that either they r doing r8 thing to send their son/dt to d other city or not. When I was carried off my feet for Delhi at d same time I left a so called TENSION 2 my family. Though d appearance of Assamese n d other 7 states people quite different but yeah still I have little mongolian look n I faced hardly racially discriminate by my friends when they got quite impertinent. Well, after seen my slovenly manner, cuparious behaviour come itself from them. After all they r my best friends. But not everyone has d capability to control their anger when a stranger discriminate u. After facing it the indignation of Northeastern resulted two things specially untold
1. Why will call me chinese ? I m an INDIAN, I am only an INDIAN n I will be an INDIAN even if u discrimante me, at utmost level of anger still my mind not goin 2 support any other country.
2. We may not understand/speak hindi, but we know our national anthem. And heartly respect it sing it as a responsibility citizen. N we are responsible for our country.
    People from China are called chinese. Dn how we become chinese ? :p we stay in India.
Heights of stupidity :
a manipuri friend I had. He was asked where he from. He replied MANIPUR. Dn from the otherside the reply was "u gt admssion here through NRI quota ?"
another incident with me.. I said I m from Assam. Reply was " Assam ? Ye Punjab me h na ?"
   ye sab sun k 2 hum yani northeast k log aur jyada proud kartein h BEING INDIAN. Atleast we have the obligatory knowledge of our country as well as put us off after hearing such types of things from u. Yaha vi other state k log rehte h, but they never faced like that. May b little by some uneducated. So much fear come to us guys. Kahin na kahin northeast ka baanda to kuch aisi situation face karta hi h. Recently a news releted to them an assamese guy found hangning on ceiling in Gaziabaad a clear evidence of hitting spot on head, he was studying medicine n was class topper(from news paper). Aisi news northeast tak bohot negativity k saath pahuchta h. India's growing too fast ; is type k behaviour humko suit ni karta. MARS tak pahuch gayi h India. Aur aisi desh mae discrimination vi hote h. SHAME :(.  Racial discrimination jyada hote h Delhi me (Research analysis said). People's mentality n their amiability very much matter to us. BDW, 25% people are the dishonest, rest of 75% are stand for us. Just be nice, n it will be a feather in ur cap. Everyone should search for gathering roses only not their thorns, I am saying it 2 northeastern people as well. Be optimistic, be positive  be calm:).
To the confessior #3868. No offence but want to tell u one thing by saying DELHI PEOPLE by ur friend wasn't wrong at his point. I'm sure crestfallen he was when he said like dt. Do tin logo k bajah se saara north ka name kharab h. N it just u who failed to prove  that "No ! Delhities are best". Instead giving him faith u breaking up d relationship. N d way u comparing other cities with Delhi, I found it logicless. Sometime comparing becomes worse. Isn't it like we often see on tv in a debate with politician blaming other cities when a bad incident happnd in his city n debate was running on d basis of that case saying " such type of incidence more happens in their state(blaming)  than that of our state"
A nice reply by #Ravi_Mittal (y
)"Delhi being capital of India should up as an example for the entire country 4 gUd reason"        BE INDIAN, BE PROUD, RESPECT OTHERS :)
and I wish u 2 everyone WISH YOU HAPPY DIWALI in advance :)</p>
