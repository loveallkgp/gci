<p>I made dis confession on different confession page, </p>
<p>After three days posting dis confession, I sent dis link to my partner, he said he liked as a person I m but he can't accept dis relation, he tried to console me den and there, and then he deactivated his profile for next three months, he activated his profile back he didn't block me, then after few days later I received a call from his end, he did not say any thing I was just saying hello hello.. Then I disconnected the call, again when last week jammu climate was not well, I msged him and asked him is he alryt.. He said yes everything is fine here. 
Now I don't understand what he wants, y does he responds to me, if he is completely in his st8 life then y does he respond, y can't he just ignore me. Should I consider the a soft corner for me in his heart. And yes I can't see him happy in my absence. It kills me when he uploads his new pics on fb. 
Its been a long while now but still at the end of the end I miss him. 
Admin guide me on it.</p>
<p>Actually admin I m trying to join two different threads here if it makes sense then post it ,if doesn't then dont . </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, if someone is going, then let them go. Don't hold them with a thread. The memories will fade away with time and you will recover as new people will enter. Just don't stick to the one who fucks with your head.</h1>
