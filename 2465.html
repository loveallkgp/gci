<p>Manish Dutta This summer remains me the days of my childhood days... It was the my age of 7...where i use to go there my granny's house for every summer vacation... I spend my whole day roaming around there town/village..with my young brother and cousin brother.. And we also send sometimes playing beside our house also.. My cousin brother,who is age of 13/14 that time. He's with his family is staying up there at my granny's house only... With him only we brothers go around the town/village as he knew every area over there... Our parents also don't bother about us as my cousin is Big enough to look after us..he also buy something to eat, whatever we ask to him.. He show some more care to me..i don't know why but i like that of his being...that time...He sometimes take me with him on his bike ride..too..as i like speed up rides...he avoids my younger brother.. when he's caring me.. One day its was a very hot summer..where house members my granny,my parents,cousin parents gone out of some work or any sort of outing business..and we're not going out to play as of this hot weather..so beside te house we played 'hide&amp;amp;seek' there my young bro..was seeker..he was counting the numbers upto 50..where he even don't know to count numbers correctly ..we use to make him to count correctly always where he making it soon..before we get in to hide itself .. As at third round when my bro was counting we both ran up to his House..where there is only condition that we has to hide,with in our house compound wall...he was searching for us he couldn't find us that we've closed the door in..we been seeing him by window..he's coming up near to the door ..he thought its was locked...and he went in search to another place... There something i feel strange..my cousin&amp;amp; me we both gazing at window gap..He was behind me inclined on me where we're standing as he was hugging me from behind..he made his chin on my shoulder...this made me feel Woo ..he in same position with me he made walked to bed room..there will be no cot in seem..he raised my mood gently he kiss my neck, </p>
<p>//Censored for bein awkwardly explicit//</p>
<p>it was like a great feel that tempted me so...... aw.. uff.. uff.. there it goes on..then after he got up from..there..he made me to rest as it is..he get his clothes 'dothi' on..i too understood that's its got over..i quickly grab my clothes to put on..he opened the door..and we both came out..we couldn't see my younger brother where he'll be. he was sleeping down at granny's house ..we came down he went to bathroom...when i came i could feel that some thing sticky in my butt..so slippery between my butt..when i walk...i too go to bathroom..as i feel something weird about that...i could see only a watery liquid so sticky when i touch in my butt..i washed it off for several times..i could feel some even after so.. That was evening so then i go to my granny room watching some tv program and i slept off..there my parents, granny and my other relatives of house too came in..who had gone some where outing.. Whatever its was a happy amazing moment i was so confused and scared of being like this..i was temped to have once again.. As so we do it when we're not seen by any one in time as we had before..we could feel our self when we are alone...as several times..then i packed up to my place as vacations over.. This story is still there..to go on.... #i still hate those moments..bse now i coudnt concentrate in my life; decisions...im now 20 im in love with a girl she love me, trust me ...but mind always make a twist in me..i use to think some times to avoid her to talk; couldnt bare that pain in both hearts... </p>
