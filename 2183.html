<p>There is a girlish gay in my office.. he is around 27-28 i guess... he is V&amp;A trainer.. i have crush for him  and if there are other gays in office they must have too thing for him bcz he is so cute and adorable ....and very successful in his life.. for me he is my role model.. bcz i want to be a V&amp;A trainer. he is that much smart that so many girls in my office told me that they feel for him... he is very gud nature person as well.. his trainee always praise him.. and he is very popular among other st8 trainers as well.
The bottom line is- doesn't matter who u r btm,top, bi or whatever, we are just gays. so if u r hard-working and good at heat u will make ur own way. "whenever i see that guy i feel proud to be a gay" </p>
