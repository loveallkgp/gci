<p>well i am at an IIT campus doing my summer internship and he, well i don't have any problem using his name, Sai Dwivedi is here for the same reason. we met just casually during our orientation ceremony on the first day of our internship. he is from Orissa. he is cute, utterly cute. Mostly he looks sad because the college canteen serves only vegetarian food and he is a devout fan of non-veg. i like when he talks about the chicken dishes he likes. i see a spark in his eyes which makes me think that i can do anything for them. He is committed most probably coz i see him mostly over the phone in hushed tone. lucky must be she, his love. Whenever he goes past me, he gives a charming , effortless smile nd when he leaves , he tells 'bubyyeee' , not 'bye'. 
i love you. but this love comes with a alidity, a validity of two months the tenure of our internship </p>
<p>$ABBY : you know you will end up sad if you will fall for him . believe me ...!!! its nothing but one sided fuvking love with no guarantess , no future.. its fucking lotto which has a price but no reward .</p>
