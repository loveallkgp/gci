<p>Hi buddies,
This is not a confession but just a piece of information I wanna share with you guys.
Most people and even gay guys don't understand sexuality that well. It's like a continuous spectrum. The two extremes are hetero and homo and then there are in between. We call them bisexuals and most of them are not like 50%-50% as most of us think. Some are more inclined to guys and some towards gals. And rarely some are perfectly inclined to both sexes equally.
Same goes for tops and bottoms. Versatile again can prefer more bottom role or more top role.
Before I wrap, can I ask one things to guys over here. I feel offended when someone asks who wears the pants in the relationship or dono mein se mard kaun hai. Ya for female part kaun hai. Do you guys feel the same. What's your take on this?
One last question to all of you. Would you like to be in a relationship with a guy who is HIV positive?
Thanks.
Love
Harry</p>
<h1>Viv- Beautifully explained. And yes, these questions do trouble me when someone asks "who is the male and the female in a gay relation?" Why should anyone bother? Do we invade private lives of straights? Blehhh...</h1>
