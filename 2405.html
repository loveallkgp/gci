<p>Hello friends, I am a GAY and I have been living this life since I took my first babystep into these world. I had always been sexually weak and would often get discharged very quick with an active partner during foreplay itself. The time I need till I get orgasm depends on the passion and vigour involved in sex with my partner. With very masculine/ sexually attractive partner I get discharged very quickly and then looses interest to indulge further. With relatively weak partner I can hold on for a long time but then again I don't get mentally satisfied with relatively weak men since I always get attracted to raw masculinity in men. I have never consulted a doctor regarding this but I am not sure that medicines can really find a remedy to this problem. Is there a solution to this problem friends ? Is anyone else is suffering from the same problem ?</p>
<h1>GCI- That's your excitement level that varies with the type of person you are with. Next time when you think you are gonna ejaculate early, just stop and hold it in. Prolong your foreplay and try practicing relaxation and distraction techniques.</h1>
