<p>Why on the bloody earth is everyone so ugly over here? Ok ugly is a strong word - sorry - but you know what I mean. I don't usually get close to most guys over here because i know mostly are into sex and are big douche. But the three-four people I've seen the real pics look so...not really good looking. Very disappointed!
I for one look really good; much better than average. And I want someone who'd also be a little above average. But I don't know where such guys are. Definitely not here as much as I've seen people here in past six years. I'm 20 btw and you guys might pass negative comments on me that 'I'm actually a douche for looks don't matter if heart and soul is good and blah blah..." But lets be real, looks DO matter. No matter how much you try to deny but deep down every one knows. It is how it is with us creatures.
Sure what matters most is how a person is on inside but one can't deny that attraction to how one looks (plus hygiene too, mind you) plays a vital vital role.
I don't know if I ever will find a guy like this or I'm being too choosy. But such guys do exist and I'm positive Insh'allah I will find one for me one day. :) Hope you guys find the perfect guy for yourselves too. :) Stay blessed!
P.S. Don't judge me. I'm not horrible person. ;) Just little realist. And saying things here which I'd dare not say in front of another man. Hell I'd never ever make any boy feel un-beautiful from my comments because hurting people like this ain't my thing. Little hypocrisy if does good, it's alright! :D XOXO</p>
<h1>GCIL- Bitch I partially agree with you, but beautiful and ugly are just nomenclatures in today's era and I guess u must see the beauty of men from around the world and then make notions...</h1>
<p>P.S- U maybe ugly to somebody too. Be ready for that too.</p>
