<p>Hello. </p>
<p>I am a content gay but have never been romantically involved with any other guy so far. I had few flings in the past but that is it. However being at the age of 28 years now, I am being pressurized to marry a girl. So far I have kept this issue at bay with excuses like career, salary, property etc. but I currently am very well settled financially (not like super rich but rich enough to get married). So I can not use that anymore and so I have realized that the best way is to tell my parents that I will never marry a girl. They are visiting me come November after Diwali and I am thinking of using that time to tell them. However I am not sure how I should approach the situation. Should I:
1) Tell them that I am impotent or something like that I am physically not fit to marry, (again a lie but more acceptable but with side-effects of going to sexologists etc. for their satisfaction)
2) Simply tell them I am gay. They have been open minded in the past for different issues but sometimes I really sense a regressive attitude for some issues in their talks for example premarital sex, girls smoking etc.; so I am actually not sure how they would react to it.</p>
<p>To give you more background, I am a Hindu, a North Indian guy from the state of Uttar Pradesh, settled in Bangalore Karnataka, and younger of the two brothers. My brother is happily married with a 4 months old kid and that is all the more reason that the marriage baton pressure is building up on me now with my bhabhi leading the charge along with my mummy.</p>
<p>Can I get some advice from the admin and other confessors and readers with their coming out experiences to close ones specially in the Indian context and how I should tell them? I mean, where to start and lead the conversation.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well ultimately the truth will come out. There will be questions raised by our precious society and the relatives. Lets not ignore the fact, they always do. Even the worst couples ever, who are barely hanging together, will always ask, "why your son is not getting married?"</h1>
<p>Lets see, if you get a guy with whom you have to settle, then your impotency lie will not be a good one. </p>
<p>So in my opinion, a guy of your mentality and thinking, should make a right decision. You are already financially independent. I guess, nothing is gonna harm you if we take the worst case scenario. </p>
<p>There is no proper method to lead the convo. Just tell them you are gay. Or if you want to be a bit emotional you can always go like, "Mum, dad.. if I were physically disabled, would you have loved me?" Their answer will always be, "Of course beta. Ye bhi koi poochhne wali baat hai?" Then you can say, "You know that I love you and I hope this changes nothing in our relationship. I-am-gay." Just pop the bubble like this.</p>
