<p>Umm... What would you do if you loved someone more than anything else in this world... That person, who recently had a breakup with his bf, loved his bf a lot, and needs time to get over it... He also says that he had started developing feelings for you... But is not sure about getting into a relationship... You are not demanding... And are happy that at least he is a good friend of yours... Both of you understand each other well... You see your future only with him, but he is afraid of taking about future right now... You both are very open...and he said he will tell you if he is ready for a relationship... (There is no other problem...problem as in understanding, compatibility, maturity, etc... Additionally, you both are potentially good partners...)</p>
<p>Do you see any future in this relationship? I mean, no matter what, you will stay good friends..but..will it grow further??</p>
<h1>GCI- The thing is that the other person really need some time without a relationship. One cannot jump into a new one after a breakup immediately. He'd be doing wrong to the new guy. He should be atleast sure that his past isn't gonna trouble the new one because if it does, then the new relation would be a mask for a rebound and it does not end good.</h1>
