<h1>GCI- No one can become gay or anything like that. Its you who have to talk him down seriously, in a good way about this and explain him that you cannot be with him at all. Moreover, tell you friend about him and ask him to not be mad on his brother. What he needs is some reality talk that you both can give him.</h1>
