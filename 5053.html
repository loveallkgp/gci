<p>majority of the population in my class think of me being gay. i'm a college student. My best friend was cool with me in the beginning months but almost after a year he told me, he doesn't want to associate himself with me because it would make him also gay in the eyes of classmates.
he would never talk to me.He has left me. He is also a closeted gay but seem heterosexual. </p>
<h1>GCI- It's better he left you. In a way he showed that he was never your best friend. Best friends don't leave. He can ignore the truth for now but at one stage he will have to face it. Double standards.... ugh.. my brain hurt now.</h1>
