<h1>Straight_Crush:-</h1>
<p>It was raining...i was in bus,had a window seat listening with music with cords when my mob buzzed...it was his msg...
my best friend since 8 months ...i always wanted to befriend him since i saw him and now we are :D
About him...well he is the typical guy next door type,an inch taller than me,Very fair with Light brown eyes brown hairs...sometimes i doubt whether he is foreign hybrid :p
He is the most innocent guy i ever met,shy,well mannered,Not girly still more sweet than a girl,intelligent ...   lol he is almost perfect :p(I on d other hand am quite opposite  ps: but m not dumb :p)
    I read his message " hey i wana tell u something"
i replied -will be there in 5...(feeling excited that he wants to tell something!!! But i shouldnt expect much)
when i got down the bus it was already raining heavily...  as i reached near the gate i saw him standing holding on to his umbrella typing on his mobile probably trying to text me...
i was so surprised he waited for me in this heavy windy rain outside the college gate but i had to keep this feeling low (afterall we are just friends)
he saw me and gave that angelic smile...
We met and entered the college a bit drenched .We had electronic practicals... as we both reached quite late so our teacher assigned us to cut trim the ends of wire it was good as we got some alone time to talk about what he wanted to say...
we sat on the bench near the window....the environment was cool...
 i tried reading his expression he looking quite confused i touched his shoulder and asked what happened...
He looked at me and smiled then looked outside the window.I saw his fingers tensed wire and then he said...
"I think its gonna b...."</p>
<h1>GCI : i didn't got the story .. its ending was ..wait it has no ending ... . great essay on 'my straight crush' .</h1>
