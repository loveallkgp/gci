<p>hello viv...i want to confess something.
"I am 21 from chandigarh. i like watching smart and sexy guys. I adore them. does that mean i am gay?. but i dun like sucking cock neither do i like fucking. i once tried doing sex with a guy of my age but we just ended up doing smooching only. Suggest me what to do. Moreova, Whenever i try to meet someone , there is always fear in my mind that what willl happen if he reveals my sexuality or meet me in future somewhere and create problem in my life."</p>
<h1>Viv- Being gay has a much more wider meaning and it is not constricted to looking at guys and getting physical with them. Give yourself a bit of time to feel comfortable with guys if you want to get physical with them. Do not rush into it like most of the newbies do. And as for the last part the guy whom you meet with can never ever reveal you until he reveals himself. Even if this kind of situation happens you can always fire back. Try to act smartly!</h1>
