And close to my family . . . . .she know everyone in my family . . Because she spend some time with them on her indian trip . . . so I decided to tell her about my sexual preference . . . so here I post my chat with her on whatsapp . . .to show you guys what is her opinion or thinking about us. [11:04PM, 22/03/2015] Mam. whatsapp: I said....I know....you believe in God....me too....Creator created only a one Man and only a one women..... [11:04PM, 22/03/2015] Mam. whatsapp: And man has to have only a one WOMEN [11:07PM, 22/03/2015] Mam. whatsapp: I hope you got answer on your question [11:07PM, 22/03/2015] Me: you want to say . .

<h1>GCI- Darling, she is Russian. What else do you imagined would have happened? COnsidering the present scenario in Russia, it's really really bad for LGBT people. Do not get your hopes up. Come out of that country as fast as you can.</h1>
