<p>I as my habit and carefree nature provided my number in a social networking site named topix delhi gay sex. I usually don't meet with guys frequently but sometimes. One day a gUy called me and I somehow randomly decided to meet him for some casual fun and take him to my room where I was staying. He was good looking and physically very strong. I gave him blow job but did not allowed him to do anal. He came and we did it for about 20 minutes and after that he quickly got up and put on his clothes. I asked him whether he would leave and he said "no". He started to ask me whether I was staying alone and where I am employed and other personal details. I told him that I stay alone but didnot tell him about my job and any other things. Then he told me that he is an escort and I am required to pay him for his service. I told him that I am not entitled to pay him as he never told me about it and I would have never met him had he told me that he is after money. Then he started blackmailing me that he would create a ruckus in my area and would tell my landlord and neighbours about me. He would call his other friends who stays nearby. Suddenly he changed his behaviour and appeared like a criminal capable of even murdering me. I could see that violent streak inside him, in his eyes and body language. He started to blackmail me for money and ultimately we settled for Rs.5000. He deleted his number from my mobile as he didnot want to leave any evidence. He was physically very strong and masculine and he hit me physically and abused me and slapped me. I felt helpless and started crying in front of him and even fall on his feet to leave peacefully and settle the matter amicably. Finally he left my room. But I am so socked that I am unable to share it with anyone in the city. I am having a night mare as I am staying alone here. I understood that I have unfortunately fallen into a racket that is in operation through that site that I have specified above. I am also fearful of other possibilities that may appear at this juncture. These people if they are in a group can continue to blackmail me together. In this difficult times when government and administration is visibly against homosexuality how could you expect justice. Even on police I don't have any hope as they are extremely corrupt and insensitive and may create more problems for me instead of finding solution. However, I hope this do not recur and the guy don't trouble me any more. As I have confessed this incident I would request my gay mates here that please be very cautious with your life. GAY world is very dangerous. There are people who may exploit you.. There are people who are into drugs and women and may use you for money. There are extortionists as I have interacted with one and explained here. You cannot expect help from the police because police and administration is very insensitive. So where should you go ? Be very cautious while you are in social networking sites. This world is so fake and dangerous my dear friends. I had my lesson and posted here seeking your help if possible in this regard.</p>
