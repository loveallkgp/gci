<p>Myself Prakash 21 bottom from Mumbai. When I was in school, a gay teacher kissed me on lips. Due to that my brain turned gay. I am now only attracted to men and meet them for sex. I have tried hard to become normal but it hasnt helped. I feel so much hate for that gay person. Why did he have to ruin my life? He could have kissed a already gay person only. I understand some people are born gay and that is OK. But I was converted by a gay person . That's why I feel angry and sad. Gay men should never be allowed close to kids to turn them gay. </p>
<h1>GCI- Well if you were turned gay, I think it should be possible for you to turn straight as well. Go kiss girls and see if your dick stands up for them. If you can, I don't think there's a problem for you and there is not point in complaining anyway.</h1>
