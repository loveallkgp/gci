<p>Well hi everyone...salaam to all..from the past one month i have been reading so many confessions here...some made me laugh..some made me wept bitterly..some were as sweet as a fairy tale can be..some were as stupid as people can be and some... well i don't need to say more..but today if u guys could really feel my words then i would like to take the pride in sharing an overwhelming feeling which i think most of us would want to have once in their life...my nephew who is barely 10 months old has given me those feelings which i longed for .....while in the balcony when he was playing with me my eyes were constantly fixed on his playful movements which makes him even cuter than he really is... my eyes got wet without any reason ...just looking at him was enough to do that.....whenever he is in my lap he embraces me with his cute little warm hands and i melt as if this was the only feeling that was left for me to breathe...his feet try to reach my shoulder and he kicks on my stomach and torso ...once he tried to suck milk from my chest which i felt was the most maternal feeling to be felt..he always counts on me after he wakes up in the morning...i even have now developed the habit of staying awake late like upto 2 o clock just to ensure he drinks lukewarm milk which i boil..his mother , my sister in law even remarked that i am like his second mother..it was the most rewarding comment i ever heard from a woman..
i have divided my time schedule according to his eating and sleeping hours...he is so into me that he doesn't sleep without my cuddling and i take him out for an evening walk....i can go on and on like this but i know i cant...guys i dont know whether as a gay person what i would get from my life or what hurdles i have to cross but the feeling of parenthood is a feeling that motivated me even more and made me a more better person then i could thought to be...i would just say that whether we get a life partner or not but be brave,mature and strong enough to raise a child ...because in my opinion WE ARE RENOVATING THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE AND ADDING NEW LIFE TO IT....and sooner or later the ball shall be in our court..</p>
