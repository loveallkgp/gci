<p>I just want to share a horrible period of my life asking you all to be careful before getting close to anyone or coming out.  In my hostel was a guy whom I was close friends with. I somehow felt he was gay due to many little things but wasn't really sure. One day in a weak moment I tried to kiss him and he pulled back asking are you mad? I tried to apologize but he told all his friends about me. My life became hell. They started calling me Karan johar and would pass sick comments like mu me lega kya, kitne logonne gand mari hai, meri underwear chatega kya. They used to piss on my bed and sometimes put used condoms in my tiffin. No one wanted to be my roommate or talk to me. I finally moved to a PG but the insults continued in college. I once hit a guy in anger and the matter went to professor. The guy lied to professor that I was gay and try to touch guys cock in class. I was really scared. The professor warned saying this would be my last chance and if I acted gay again he would rusticate me. He said if I wanted to be gay then go to American college not here. I spent the remaining two years totally alone and with constant jokes but somehow completed my degree. I am really shocked how many so called activists encourage teens to come out in college saying their life would be better that way. I want to SLAP those gay "activists".</p>
<h1>GCIL- Calm down honey, the milk will always be milk even if it burns your tongue. Try not to consume it when it is too hot.</h1>
<p>P.S- Coming out is not necessary in a homophobic environment when u don't have any kind of backup...sorry but I did not tell u to kiss ur roommate.
Goodluck with the future kissing.</p>
