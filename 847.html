<p>hello.
right now i m cuddling and swiming in deep sea of love thoughts, more imaginations, less practical and in more dumb behaviour.
so i m 21 years geek type of a guy and im preparing for master from iit and styding hard to get a seat.
my
classmate from colleg who is my best friend (ya i think so ;) ) is in
delhi for some months for coaching and sometimes i invite him to my home
for late night studies etc .
now this is the strange thing i m noticing in my head is I M GETTING FEELING TOWARDS HIM AND FEELING LOVE FOR HIM.</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH
he seems to be straight and i know most of his gfs. but ( nowadays no
one can exactly find about the sexual orientation) .....</p>
<p>we share
same bed and he intensionally or accidently or un knowingly may be
knowingly HUGGS ME late night and bcz of his behaviour i cant adjust
myself to get a single minute of sleep.</p>
<p>right know i came to know he is afraid of dark when i cracked some jokes on him abt his kiddish behaviour etc...</p>
<p>the moment he hugs me, i have so deep intense feelings and urge to kiss him (not SEX) but i cant.</p>
<p>when ever we travel from buses he pushes his head moat of the time on my shoulders like he prented to sleep or what i dont know?</p>
<p>all these gestures are not making me feel concentrating on my studies seriously.</p>
<p>he sometime give me flying kisses in classes and i just see him and ignores most of the time...
i know he is straight i have seen his gfs in colleg and obviously he seems to be straight but i have a doubt.</p>
<p>may
be i think these kisses ,hugs or intensionlly showing affection by
touching, laying on shoulders etc ARR BCZ IF HIS kiddish or most
preferrbly child like behaviour...but i m confused.....</p>
<p>im all the way gay but not a despo queen to get laid whenever anywhere everywhere with anyone.</p>
<p>i
just love hiM BUT WHAT YOU GUYS SUGGEST ME? SHOULD I TELL HIM ABT THIS
FEEling to him....or if he found straight; will he break friendship wth
me of 4 years...
im in big delimmaaaaaaaaaaa.....</p>
<h1>Viv- Why don't you just enjoy his touch and his attention and try not to bother about love because if he is straight then you two aren't gonna happen. BTW, you can tease him by saying, "You are so gay" and notice his reactions and then judge his sexuality. Note one thing, nothing is complicated until we make it.</h1>
