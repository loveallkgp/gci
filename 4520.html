<p>Hello everyone
Well iam a indian guy studying medicine in ukraine.
I need some suggestion from admin and from other people who will read this confession.
Iam a gay n from the very begning of my gay life i always wanted a bf in my life but nowdays dnt know what is happening with me.it seems to me that iam loosing my interst in a loyal lovable caring relationship.
When my ex broke up with me in 2011,i never fall in love with anyone,i dnt know why.
Manytimes my distance has created obstacle in my life too because most of the guys want relationship but wo bhi uske sath who is near to them.
Aajtk ek bat mujhe samjh nhi ayi if some one really want a lifetym loyal relationship with any1 aur jb unhe loyal guy approach bhi krta hai to why they always measure tht thibg with distance?
I know distance matters a lot but i believe distance is nothing if the feelings are true.
Well kehte hai dhundne se to bhagwan bhi mil jate hai phir hune to sirf koi pyar krne wala chayien.
This time i want to fall for some 1 special (i know love can happen anytym anywhere n with anyone, ye sb planning krke nhi hota)but still i want to be the reason for some ones smile.
Fingers crossed,hope for the best
Will wait for your comments guys </p>
