<p>hello members and admins we love u for maintaing this page so well....
MY  confession starts from delhi metro.i was sitting on the seat just.closest to door.one 30years old uncle came towards me and insisted follow passenger to adjust for some room for him.he sat besides me.then that admi pulled out some paper notes from his bag and rolled those papers and wrote his name and no. on the circular sides of that rolled paper and was constantly hitiing pressing my hands thighs by that paper.i was like hawwwww.eh ki honda paya hega. i was confused ki accept his proposal or refuse it.but meko laga ki may be that uncle is in special police staff of dehi police to catch randomly, people of sick mental health in metro who are only searching for their prey etc in metro coaches. but me koi sadakchap thode na tha jo usne ye kiya.me to apni coaching pe ja ra tha saket.
so i decided to teach him a lesson and i stood up at malviyanagar station farted heavily on his face and  de boarded the metro as soon as poosible bhag bhag ke. that fart was so loud ki 2 -3 aunties on ladies seat were laughing badly.aur us uncle ko bhi maje aa gaye honge.hahah.</p>
<h1>GCI :  30 years isn't uncle technically . ..</h1>
<p>and why would delhi police go like this .searching for 'mentally ill ' people .. by giving their no and name .</p>
