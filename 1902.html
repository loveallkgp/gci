<p>Hi, I m 25 yes old, definitely well presentable, hv never ever dated a girl even though i got many proposal( not bragging but honestly), I just finished my MBBS course in one of the most prestigious college in india ,and oh god it is so boring and why not, I m surrounded by geeks and nerds who are mostly virgins n will go for arranged marriage...but the most memorable and interesting thing happened during my course...I came to the conclusion that I am an official gay and had a huge crush and fallen for my best friend..who is very nice to me and treats me very well..how I wished he is on same team...he used to burrow laptop from me..one day he found my gay related videos and internet search..and he sent me a message that he found those what does that mean?..I told him I m confuse about my sexuality even though I was very sure about it..but later one day I took the guts to tell him I HV feelings for him.. its surprising that he rejected it so nicely that he said he likes girls nevertheless he will remain my best friend..after that I tried to stay away from him becoz it was hard for me..it took quite some time to get over him..and then I met my current n first bf who is from the same place as my best friend..since then I m having a happy and healthy life...we have planned to stay forever like this..before I felt being gay is burden but after accepting myself I feel quite free and happy...this is who I really am..n being yourself is the best thing you can do to be happy..</p>
<h1>GCI : that really lovely thing and i hope that things work betwwen you two .. and hope story of you two enlightens some hope in our readers . :) ^_^</h1>
