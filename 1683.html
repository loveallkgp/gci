<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    First of all I would like to give a bucket full of thanks to #Viv for wonderfully managing this page!!!!
    My Confession is..... I always wanted to be loved by a Guy and even want now to be loved!!! But i think i will never get one !!! But my problem is I imagine too much..... Drenched in the World of Imagination, I imagine myself being loved by a Shy Cute Guy.... (i like shy guys a lot :P) it feels awesome when they open out to u and hesitatingly admit that they love you!!!(Though noone has done that to me but i have seen it in Movies :P) Since, i have never got a guy who will be loving understanding (will not crave for sex all the time) (Manta hu Kabhi Kabhi Chalta hai who will never leave your side and always be with you even if the whole world stands against you!!! But now this Imagination is affecting my Academics.... i want to be a successful person in my life and can&#39;t ruin my life bcoz of this.... May be if once i bcom successful i may gather courage to open out!!!
    Moreover i fell in love with my college mate.... he&#39;s straight!!! That&#39;s a mistake i made!!! but he&#39;s so Handsome and cute that i couldn&#39;t resist!!! I love him a lot.... He loves me too but just as a friend !!! He has hugged me several times!!! and i just love to get hugged by him!!!! Well he has ill opinions about Gays (I hate people who don&#39;t respect others Be it a Girl or a Guy), so i couldn&#39;t even tell him otherwise i would have lost even his friendship and slowly My love towards him has faded somwhere!!! Khair Merey Liye Accha hi Hua but what about my Imaginations???? Ye to mujhey concentrate hi nahi karney detey

    Can you Guys tell me some way to get over my imaginations... I know its difficult but koi to tarika hoga!!!! Aap sabkey chotey se chotey suggestions bhi shaayad merey kaam Aa jaye!! Help me Please what should i do ??? Sorry for bieng too long...

<h1>Viv- Taubahh! Your imaginations are really cute. I mean they are like true and honest feelings. Why do you want to let go of them? Just have a long lasting dream like after 10 years you will see yourself established, financially settled and with a nice partner and start working for that goal. But work for your future only. Maybe you will get a chance at love in between. If you do then its way better! Just don't go looking for love. It will not do you any good.</h1>
