<p>Hello Everyone,
Everyone says that confessions relaxes the heart. Lets see...m trying it out and here to pen down about my past...
I was 15-16 when i realised about my orientation.....being a strong Christian believer i thought it was a sin to have attraction towards same sex.then thanks to a friend who introduced me to a lady named Francine in Germany who was running a church and also was a lesbian. Weeks of counselling made me to accept my orientation and I opened up to my Aunt who was more like a friend to me,,Though she was very worried initially but then i always ruled over her.then the hunt began....rediff messenger....Guy4men...thats when i came across Sabby...a guy from Thane Maharastra...We had long chats n conversations over the phone...huh Aunt used to pay my phone bills,,,,,lol so nice of her!...Then Sabby n me had common interests in our lives,,,We both were very much inclined towards our religion and loved food and most importantly were crazy about music...Thats when i auditioned for the band in which he was a guitarist...guess what ,,I got selected and was about to meet him for the first time....I still remember it was 4am when my train arrived at Kalyan,,where he was waiting for me...my fav white flowers in hands,,,he stood tall and smiling at me...We went to many places around.I stayed there for few days n then the day came when he proposed for relationship.I was very confused as he was very young I was 18 then and he was 29...but then i felt inclined towards him and after a couple of days i said yes to him..and then we celebrated our love for each other and that night i surrendered my long saved virginity to him....lol not a big deal i suppose...I melted in his arms and was completely engulfed in his soul.Few days later I returned back to Orissa and we were again on our phone calls and chats,they even became more profound and ofcourse reasonable...We were in love..every two months we used to meet...and make love..It was so wonderful that how 3 years n 7 months passed by we could never know,,,in this short span we had fights lol....intense love,,,care ,,,trust,,understanding,possesiveness,,and ofcourse great sex...But then his widow mother started forcing him to marry a girl...he was in huge dilemma...he had to make a choice..He was the only son ,,,and I am no good in competition to a mother.....I lost,,,I lost him,,His marriage was fixed...He wasn't happy and my heart was mourning...My utter silence was killing him...I met him 12 days before his marriage in Thane...It was the last time we saw eachother...We broke up....months later i also lost my Aunt who was everything to me,,She died of Cancer...Life was brutal the famous line of Memoirs of Geshia was flowing across my mind,, I had lost all hope...I started scoring low marks in my exams,by this time Sabby had a daughter ,,By the grace of God I stood up..After couple of years i even tried to date some guys ,,but then nothing worked...lol...............
4years have passed by.. I've got a job...keeping busy,,,,though m still incomplete and single but still m not sad..I am happy about my life,,I am happy being gay..I am happy....Spreading happiness to the less fortunate give immense satisfaction so ...indulging myself on all sort of activities..and keeping myself away from this love making thing....perhaps LOVE had few lifespan in my destiny........
Thanks for reading...
Regards,
Vishu</p>
<h1>GCI- It could have gone in an entirely different way if only you both have really decided to live together in really and not just in dreams. His marriage won't last long or even if it does, he will be worse than miserable. So will be you. At the end of the day, you will miss him and your mind will not be at peace. If only you could have stayed together.</h1>
