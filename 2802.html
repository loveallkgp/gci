<p>An incident which almost made me to kill myself. I have really good friend, rahul. We've been together since we were in hsc, I used to visit him at his house, and he used to do the same. One day when i went there, he has in bathroom, and he requested me to wait for some minutes, i agreed. His house was empty then.... Somebody knocked at the door, it was his elder brother, he called me and ordered me to follow him, and he took me a bit far away from his house, in a dark lane, he grabbed my collar and said, "i know you're a gay, so stop coming at my home, and if you'll try to sexually seduce my brother, I'll slit your throat. You gays deserve to die.. And if ill ever see you calling him or anything, I'll drag you outta your home and will beat in front of your family".... After hearing this, i just ran away and,cried a lot, A LOT......... I almost tried to kill myself by sleeping pills' overdose.... It was horrible experience... I didn't talk to my friend for months... And when i told him the reason, he scolded his brother, now everything is normal. </p>
<h1>GCI- Freaking homophobe! These things are generally said to just threaten gays while no one actually has the guts to do what they say. It must have been terrifying for you but did you really have to attempt suicide because of what that douchebag said? You should have a strong defense ready with you if you are threatened by a homophobe. Don't just give in. Always take a stand.</h1>
