<p>have already confessed here about my boyfriend n all How He ditched Me . Its very hard to understand him really never wants to chat with Me and will Not message . But we met last week had a great sex in lodge . it was awesome after long time with him really around 1year. He is egoistic Dont know What happened He went after that No message again . But again my heart started to beat for him. I think If He really needed Me for sex He would had with many guys for sex . But He only needs Me for sex. SomeWhere He might have Feelings for Me i think. Its for sure He will marry a girl But i Dont want to get hurt again But my heart is weak started to beat for him again What to do</p>
<h1>Viv- You know the problem, you know the solution. You only said, "He only needs Me for sex" and, "I don't want to get hurt again." So, why don't your channelize your energy to focus on these two things? He has an ego to not call you after he got laid with you so you develop an ego to not feel for him. Its gonna take time but then you will feel relief. Why give satisfaction to someone who wants to see you suffer? Make them suffer by being happy.</h1>
