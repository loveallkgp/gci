<p>Admin i just needed a piece of advice from you
Just one month before i met a guy through facebook
And the i met him
I developed a feeling for her
And after that he met me again and i told him my feeling about her and he replied back that he also have same feeling about me
Admin dear
We meet everyday
We used to spend time together i go his home
He comes to my hostel for night stays
But in duration of one month i sometimes shout at him and abuse him a lot but he never feel bad 
On the other side i have watched him using the same id for meeting other guys
And he spend money on me and always says ki ur student now dont waste money
So my question to u are 
1)dear can our relationship can work
Or i should leave 
him
2)who to be blamed for such complications in the relationship
3)and he has past record of misusing ppl nd luring them to sex does past of person matter or present 
4) or i behave psycho</p>
<h1>GCI- Have you talked about all of this with him? The factor of trust is lacking between you two. Nothing can be said at this stage because you two never talked about it. If you have the fear that you are just one guy in his life to be lured for sex, make the air clear before you get a major shock.</h1>
