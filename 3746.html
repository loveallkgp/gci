<p>hello everyone 
i have a confession to make and advice to seek.
i met a guy from fb which happened after he was constantly asking for 3 yrs. i didnot meet many guys . i met him we talked and he asked me to drop him home which i did. since i am a bisexual i never want to ruin anyone guys life after him falling in love with me and i already told him and i was clear that i will eventually marry a girl  . we then startd talking and eventually we had smooched many times but i was not in love . we talked and sometimes he sqid i love u which i instantly contradicted and stopped him. then i just started ignoring his love u . but we talked as friends 
sometimes he forced me to say it  and if i didnt he started crying and said he wld commit suicide . i knw his family . one day i brought him at my house and introduced him to my family . nobody in my family liked him . he startedweeping then and there  . he assumed me his property and wanted to marry him . i again said we r just best friends . bcz he was getting too much on me i gradually reduced spending time with him . hehad some disease too and he was in the hospital and the communication was cut there . after he was well i asked abt his health and he started showing hatred bcz he wanted me to him only bt i igonred but ......day he had crossed the line calling something wrong abt my fathers' profession . i was instantly raged at this statement bt i calmed myself down which i have learnt in a few yrs .bt i cant hear anything abt my father bcz he is a diehonestperson and of course bcz i love him too . i want to kill thar guy which i eventually will. but i want ur suggestions too . 
i will post more as per ur replies</p>
