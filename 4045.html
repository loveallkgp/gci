<p>Apart from other, there r some boys who look at me...and of course you know the way of look m talkin bout. Well, I'm 19 and there r few boys in my neighbourhood who r like 12 n 13 or so. They'd secretly look at me and undoubtedly my gaydar understands the thing.
And trust me whenever I see anyone of them looking at me like that i feel really sad :( I know the feeling when u r 13 n gay n see a handsome older guy. I too have had many crushes on older guys when i was young :3 but now when i look at them it really stings me coz i know what their future is ....i know what they r gonna go thru' in few upcoming years....i already know the hardships that they will be dealing with....i know they r gonna b equally sad as i am n was....I reallly wish i could approach them and tell each one of them that there is No freaking thing wrong with them...the way they r is as perfect as any other human being on the planet...i just wanna prevent them from the negativity of the world that engulfs the jolly souls and turns them into some scared unhappy ones :/
Alas, i just cant but i really do wish that they dont have to go though what we have gone through...i cant see more sad souls... what more pains me is the fact that i see someone who i know will deal with lots of hardships but i can personally do nothing to fix or prevent it... :(</p>
