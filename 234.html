<p><strong>please censor the part that is not decent for the forum, i had to right how a felt </strong>**
I am 27 male
I was a cute little shy and girlish kid who loved to play, talk, eat, read and everything normal. Had no interest in boys. Then one night at age of 7-8 my cousin slept with me, he did dirty things, I was scared to tell it to anyone. I kept thinking why that happened. Then on another day another cousin did that to me. I was shocked. but it was not new for me. Now I was 10. Another cousin said he loves me. he kissed me, caressed my body, loved me all over. It was the time I started liking sex. And never stopped after that. I did it with some friends, some more cousins, some strangers. It got more intense when one of my cousins penetrated me at age of 13. I was hurt. I resisted. But after after so many days, so many tries ,and begging for penetration, that cousin did anal sex with me. I was hurt like anything. I cried. He said he loved me. I was like what??? Now I knew anal sex.experimented it with other. started liking it, the rush, the fear. Had enough of it,giving and receiving till age of 20.my cousins continued even after their marriage. Then I got anal fissures. fought with them for one year.never let anybody to enter me after that. Started hating the whole gay thing once again. even sex was no charm.
Now I am fine, When I think about past, I conclude that being gay is not loving other guys.Its all about sex. when you cant get it from other girls you try boys, when you are scared of being beaten from boys of your own age you molest kids of age 7. I just hate all these. Hate the feeling that had to go through all this. hate that I was exposed to sex so early, hate that my childhood was ruined by some sex maniacs.</p>

<h1>Viv- Its very sad to read about this. People say that talking about sex is tabooed and they won't talk about it. How many will be molested over this this issue? I am very sorry it happened to you. Those who molested you are not gays. They were just hole seekers. Nothing else. True gays do not do like this. they don't go around messing with kids! A childhood once destroyed cannot be repaired. Again, I'm sorry for you.</h1>
