<p>Hello admin and all my dear friends.
I am Arijit Biswas. Today I don't want to confess anything but want to ask all of you something. 'Why do gay guys marry a girl ?' Is it to maintain their so called respect in society or they are unable to accept themselves. If they are dependent on their family who are very orthodox then its ok but I see guys who are financially independent go for a hetrosexual marriage. I feel this is really sick. Some will justify that they don't wanna loose their family but I think the person who can't accept your truth, your sexuality which is totally natural, can't accept you the way you are DON'T DESERVE YOU, because they don't love you truly, accept it or not it's the truth, they are just bind by socially accepted norms and want to be respected by society.
To such people who are homosexual and still want to marry a girl I will ask them to learn from the 'Bangalore guy' who was arrested. I personally don't have any sympathy for him but I do belive that he being is arrested for a wrong cause. Instead of adultery he is arrested for sodemy. I believe that we must protest for this thing.
Coming to the main point, society will accept you when you will accept yourself. We must fight for our rights. We need to come out of our closet to make the future generation of LGBT youth acceptable. Try thinking beyond sex please and ya I would really like to know the views of our dear admin regarding this matter along with the Bangalore case and and and I think only discussing these matters here won't help we must take proper actions as well.
Thankyou!</p>
