21 M i want to break-up with my love. I love him truely bt its untorable now, the way he's talking to me, i m fed up the daily night calls ending in the fight he's ignorance is killing me i had tried a lot burned his photo, deleted his no. Slapped him even not talked 4 2 months but after a couple of times again the same routine. I know i can't live without him but what to do u only tell me i love him madly bt i think he can be more happy being apart from me. I told him to have sex with other's so that i can get hurt and leave him forever but he's not ready. Plz yar</p>
