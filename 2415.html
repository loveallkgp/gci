<p>we were just wondering if you could review our new idea of opening a gay dating agency. we feel that it's our job to make life simpler for gays who are looking for a partner. me and my group of friends have decided to do so, so here's what we are going to do..
1. we have guys who is too much in software and computers, so he will store all the profiles of gays who have registered and by matching those profules, we will find a right guy for everyone on the basis of similarities in their lifestyle.
2. our dating coaches who will be in chare of counselling , they will counsel every guy individually and personally like what they should do on dating and what to do for better relationship.
3. me and my team alloted many tasks to find perfect places in the city where we can arrange for both guys to meet, we have a special task and that is to find place for guys where they can have unique dating experience.
this will be more like a blind date for every guy who registers in our agency.
we have found a small place where we can carry out our plan and we already have large circle of gay friends who are willing to register.
we are if yoy could suggest us some more things and since you have large following. we are really excited to get their reviews too and inspire them to try this too.
thank you.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, the idea seems good but don't the gay dating websites and apps are already on the large? Most of the people use them for hook ups and yours will be having a same use to the most part. What different your website can offer? Can it be a good place for those who want a stabilized domestic partnership?</h1>
