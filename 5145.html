<p>M 24 from delhi ...my partner is 48
M Exactly not from delhi but here for some career purpose ...
I m the same who have shared his problem with u people i.e. 593 .
So everything is fine now and i hv tried to make him understand that he is important</p>
<p>.past is past nd it already hv gone ..so he felt bit relax and contented.. ...we are so close to each we love each other he understand me ..but we hv never did sex I told him once to do once but he said if u want u can do with me but m not feeling .he explained that there is probablity that after sex i get bore with him and can leave him, i want to convience him about my love towards him but how can any one do. But i think he perfectly fine on his point of view as he have faced the same in past i think i need to take time .</p>
<p>whenever we meet feel bit intense chemistry between us ..but when the time come to say bye to each other i usually feel down nd he feel the same.
I m bit introvert so i dnt talk much but i want to be with him at the end of my life but not able to say him .
And one major issue is that the reason why i m in delhi has been completed and i m not able to say him that i need to go as i tried once but he said he cant Live without me...and was bit depresaed for few day and when i told him i was joking then he got cool and things got normal ....but i need to go as i hv no work remain in delhi ....but m afraid of consequences..... what to do actually how to do is more important ..</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, I'd just say to make those decision sin life which make you feel happy and not suffocated. Don't out put yourself in a situation which you will regret later and put the blame on each other for professional things not working out. Make him understand every bit of it.</h1>
