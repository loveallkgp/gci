<p>Hiii friends .... this one is to all u gays down there ...</p>
<p>I don't understand why do we gays especially bottoms feel so underconfident ... why are they always crying behind their own self ...I m a bottom and I never cry except for love ....guys .. looks are not just everything :- I understand looks are attractive but much more than that a soul's personality matter a lot ... every day I read we feel lonely every day we miss our ex .... dude I understand moving on is not that easy but dude we have to be strong . We should rather find the reason of our rejection and we should improve ourselves and the next time we should rather fall for a better man .. dude it's really important to be with someone who deserve to be with u . I know I sound lame but dude that's the fact ....
Dude improve your personality instead of crying over a spilled milk
It's really hard to be with someone who doesn't deserve to be with u ... know yourself well and suit your self .. not matter either u stay single the whole life . But dude being just used is better than rejection ... dude ... this wasn't a confession . But it was a message to all u bottoms there like me ... </p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, being a bottom is not a tag that you should have with yourself everytime. Secondly being a passive doesn't mean that you have to beneath anybody(pun intended). Thirdly, being used can never be better than rejection. You got that wrong.</h1>
<p>Lastly, before loving someone, try to love yourself first.</p>
