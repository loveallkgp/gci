<p>hi guys!!! 25 Delhi</p>
<p>m in a kind of medical problem here. Its kind of embarrassing. Hope u guys will understand &amp; suggest something.</p>
<p>A month ago, i slept with a guy. We didn't do any sucking r fucking (Thank god!!!). But, we did Body-pLay &amp; kisisng. I think, just after that incident, i start noticing very tiny bugs sticking to my body, whenever i closely observe it. It sometimes itches too &amp; i have to literally scratch them off. They are mainly on the stomach &amp; on the legs. I thought they will go away with regular baths but its not happening. I think they are increasing. I am taking regular baths but not helpful. </p>
<p>Please guys, if there is some doctor or someone, who is aware of this situation, help me out. And, a piece of advice, Guys please dont sleep with any random guy you met on internet like i did. I am thankful to God, that i dont get any deadly STDs. But, u cant be lucky everytime.. So, choose wisely. Its ur life &amp; trust me its very precious</p>
<p>$ABBY : he is actually right . don't sleep with random stranger ... get one guy , be in a secure relationship then have sex after both being tested for std's and hiv ( u must get tested its really important and its not rude to ask your partner to get tested first .. its moral responsibility towards healthy life of yourself and your partner )</p>
<p>to confessor : i don't think its any kind on std or if that guy gave u anything . mostly if any type of std happens it  happens on genital regions mostly or in mouth then it spreads top rest . so you might going through some allergy ..go to skin specialist please .</p>
