<p>My last post was #4248.</p>
<p>So now it goes here like this.
I'm flying to Canada in December. So I needed to arrange for a room. One of the guys already (but in India right now) added me to the Whatsapp group of 5 people. They gradually started pulling my leg off. They started depreciating me. One of the guys messaged, "Bhai yahan mat aa, Canada is a fucked up place." But then he said he was just kidding. And another guy told me to chat in Gujarati (its my mother tongue and theirs as well). I was like "WTF man. Its my wish whether to use Gujarati or English." But I did not say it to him that I didn't like it. Then the previous guy sent me the pics of snow and said "I'm warning you bhai. Yahan mat aa." I mean he had said he was kidding. Then I did not understand as to why was he going on kidding with me.</p>
<p>I had told another guy in a private chat, "Bro I'm quite tensed and worried. I still haven't booked the tickets and IDK what am I gonna do." So in group chat he said, "Stop saying I'm tensed. Just ask your conerns and follow what they say" By this time, I was totally irritated by those guys. Finally I left the group. And then I messaged the admin (my main contact) that it would be good if he helped me instead. So he got angry on me. He said "Just GTFO man. This is not the way to talk. They are helping you. And you're behaving like this. Now just fuck off and manage your things by yourself." I was almost crying by the time that how scary straight guys can be. Then I started apologizing to him. He said "Don't message me" I then started saying sorry again and again. I said, "That guy had scared me like anything by saying Don't come to Canada, You'll suffer a lot." Finally the admin of the group said, "Now ask just me for any help." I told him that I'm extremely introvert and emotional guy. But I guess I'll have to cut down all of my emotions so that I can survive any hurdle there in Canada.</p>
<p>The end of the story is that I really now don't know how will I survive there around such fucking straight guys! (Well I believe every second guy is a bisexual). And I just developed more hatred for straight guys after this. But I know I'll have to kill myself emotionally and mentally to fit in with those morons.</p>
<p>P.S - Buddy please Montreal se merko milne aa sake to aana. Mujhe pakka yakeen hai ki wahan jaa ke mai straight friends nahi bana paaunga. Kyunki yahan India mein bhi mera koi straight friend nahi hai. I've always kept a distance from straight guys. Teri raah dekhunga mai mere yaar! </p>
<h1>GCI- Know this that you have to survive all by yourself. You cannot depend upon anyone ever. Make some friends to have contacts. Ultimately your good contacts will be good in getting yourself a job or find a place to stay. But yes don't get overly attached to anyone until you find them good enough. Also know that you should not be an emotional person to anyone when you come here. Your initial two months will be a struggle both mentally and emotionally but things will ease up soon for you. Hang in there and do not give up at all. God bless you.</h1>
