<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was in love with a guy who was my close friend during my college days. he was doing BAMS (Ayurvedic medicine) and me doing B.Sc. Both of us were engaged in sex (not hardcore or anal). i was loving him very much. After finishing my degree, i went for masters. he went for his masters degree.</p>
<p>Later we met 4-5 times. after sumtime he was totaly changed. he started to ignore me. i felt bad. then he stopped texting, calling and even not answering me. then in frustation i started to drink.</p>
<p>i dont why sum guys do like dis. may be he is a doctor now, so he is doing like this.</p>
<p>now i did my masters and ph.d and now a professor. i got married to a good girl and leading a happy life.</p>
<h1>GCI- And still you are here with a fake profile and confessing on a gay page. A happy life indeed.</h1>
