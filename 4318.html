<p>hey admin...!!!this is my confession n i request tat u post it on yo page so tat all the users can know abt this....</p>
<p>hey every1...!! i'm a 19 yr old guy here n i'm studying ...
well, u wud b wondering y am i telling it, but what can u imagine a 19 yr old guy to face so many probs at only an instance of time??
well, it was abt 2 months back and it was my birthday month, uk, expecting for many things!!! everybody does tat and so it happened(my unexpected expectations).....
i'm a singer n i have done many albums n concerts in most of the places but, once , i finished my singing for my new album and it was about to be released and there was a guy called zack here in our studio and he messed things up like hell... he pirated the CD n it was not any ordinary CD, a bollywood music director's compostions one... well, how do u expect when u come to know tat yo CD is being pirated n all yo efforts r like.. pooof...!!!??
then the toughest part is all the investigations were going on n this so called zack, piled up all his mess upon me... he accused on me tat i asked him to pirate the CD....!!!
this is not the end.... at the same time, my boy friend called me up n he said he really gonna need a break in our relationship which was another unexpected expectation...!!! huh!!! my mom, dad, bro n my boy , left me amidst these difficulties... no 1 believed me( even my parents)..... i stood up alone and was trying to fix things up both the sides..... it was very very painful.... my boy was like, " don't come after me n don't force me which i hate to the core... please leave me alone n it's enough of being in relationship wid u.. i'm fed up of it "
still, i believed in my love n i believed in my oath on my music...!!
investigations were complete n they came to a conclusion tat there was no mistake from my side n all the heck things were done by the one n only zack.... huh.... one side, i was relieved but, my personal life, was judging my capability to hold my love.... !! he was sliding outta my hand like butter.... couldn't even do anything... i waited for him but, nope... now he is long gone and i'm single here.... dunno the misteries the time does... really forgetting about all my love n affection and i savour my pain but i don't live with it.... do u guys think leaving my boy is a mistake???!!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- You haven't done any mistake as it is visible from your confession. That's your personal life anyways. The only point to be considered here is that everyone left you when you were in trouble. When you needed your family an your partner, they left you. There isn't any bigger betrayal than this. So you are clean in all of this situation. I am sorry that it happened with you and you have to suffer because of this but you have a nice career. You can convert the pain into something much more beautiful and amazing through your talent. Have a nice life and as impossible as it may sound, don't ponder upon it much. You cannot change it.</h1>
