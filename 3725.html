<p>Me n Mr. Prateek</p>
<p>It's been more than 5 years and everything still looks so new between us. I love you Prateek. </p>
<p>I wanna quote a lovely memory between us. Prateek called up at 11:39 pm late night, he said he loves me and wanna chat with me whole night. n we talked about our childhood, how our lives were so meaningless without each other, how much we love each other, we care 4 each other, sex chat n blah blah blah. clock stuck 6:57 am and we both were still awake. </p>
<p>I said Prateek you know you're a crazy man n I love you from the bottom of my heart. his craziness didn't stopped here, he said baby I'll be at your place at 10 and we will sleep together and yup guess what, he showed up at 9:57 am, actually I've digital watch and my awesome brain remembers everything because I write diary.</p>
<p>then he got shirtless n dropped his pant, I went red. he dragged me in bed on a chilly morning in temp 4 degree we slept half naked on each other. </p>
<p>I love you Prateek, thanks for being the biggest happiness of my life, without you my life would exactly be like this planet will be without oxygen. &lt;3</p>
