<p>I honestly never made friends during my school days and my college days were also for a year only . I live in a very small district in tamil nadu where getting good guys is next to impossible... hence I m already so alone in life . If I stand rude , arrogant and with attitude no body will even give a fuck about me ..  I have always believed to be sweet and polite..  it doesn't mean I don't have a stand of my own . I definitely do have a stand of my own but the way I speak is very polite and soft ...  which people take an advantage of ... I have always believed to speak politely and in a  humblest way . But people around me are not the same ..  and they show attitude to me in return even if I say them hii . So how do I react or act on such sort of situations when people turn rude and arrogant towards me ..  how ... abusing someone is not my kind of language ...  then how should I handle such humiliating situation...</p>
<p>Soft doesn't mean in a girly way . But soft as in like in a humblest way possible . I sound like abishek bachan all the time but my communicating skills are very polite and down to earth</p>
