<p>I am a 24 year boy from a town from those who like men with a good age difference . I had a bf who was 30 years elder than me . These are called intergenerational and sometimes dad-son relations also . I know its a bit incest but then being gay also is also a psychological disease in the eyes of straight world . I was always like this . During my peak teenage days i used to see at my teachers and uncles and not at my classmates .
Last week something happened which shocked me . My father brought a 15 year boy at home to take guidance and some classes from me as his exam were to come . He was a boy from a village who has lost his father in a mishap some months ago . I taught him , talked to him . Found him quite mature by his age , and intelligent. However his way of talking was of a villager like calling me by ' tu ' not 'aap' .
But i gelled with him very well. Taught as well as gave him indirect emotional support. First day he slept with me , i made him sleep close to me . Next night i had to go to our another place to sleep . He stayed at home . Third night when i was going , he said he wanted to go with me , he couldnt sleep second night when i was not there. I said i am going to a lonely village area where i will take care of our plot in night . He insisted to go with me . He slept hugging me and playing with my hand . I for the first time felt attracted and excited for him . Made him sleep over me , his head on my chest . However i lived with my purity and did nothing bad to him . But i cant deny that i felt mesmerized by his innocence and tenderness . I had mixed feelings for him like i felt like his father at that moment while made him lay over me , brushing his hair and talking to him gently . But why bad thoughts came to my mind for him ? I wished to kiss him on his lips .
Next day he departed and i got call from his mothes thanking me for taking care of him .
I am extremely puzzled from that day .
Now i am attracted to mature men , then when i will be 50 , am i going to get attracted to younger guys ?
If such happens ? Can anybody tell ?</p>
<h1>Viv- Its pure and simple. You were attracted to his innocence and his mature nature. Also, there was a bit of pity for him involved in your behavior. You felt like a guardian for him. But don't you see it here? The preferences are not permanent. They can change overtime. All it takes it someone for whom you can care about and feel protective about. For whom you can be shell to protect them from harm. Don't predict the future. You won't get anything by thinking about it. But don't loose any good chance just because you appear to have a different set of preferences.</h1>
