<h1>GCI- I know moving on is easier said than done. But life has to go on and you really cannot stick to the awful past for your own mental health. You will deteriorate yourself! Of course you should be ready for him to be in a relation soon. He might not even contact you much after sometime. The more you think about those memories the more sad you are gonna get. Moving on is never easy but one day it is sure that you can come out of it and when you will, you will be glad. Personal experience.</h1>
