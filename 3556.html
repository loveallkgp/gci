<p>Hey guys, today its my happiest day, its been like three years since i meet this guy from london, people say its not gonna happen coz it was just online dating n trust me guys it happened, we text we talk we share pics (not naked) sometimes get mad but love never ended, he loved me n he was my everything, we planed of meeting and make our relation grow But one day he blocked me, no word, no mails, no calls, nothing, So i call his friends who were so close to me and ask them what happen, the news was he left me coz he loved me alot, reason he left was some guys of india warning him that if he continues the relation they will inform my parents and acused me for doing illegal things, i was so mad at those people but later found out that the person was a friend of mine, maybe he was jealous of our relation coz he knew about us, i cried day n night for my love, than my friends help me to move on, i did try but no i can't, i thought myself that if my love was really true i will get him back and as my result I GOT HIM BACK, i love him alot, and this time i'll do whatever it takes to save my love, so guys i just wana say is nothing is impossible in this world if u want it with all your heart, I LOVE YOU my man &lt;3</p>
<h1>GCI- Everything was good in your confession. Just saying generally, why did he block you when the other guy threatened him? Love is supposed to be strong enough to not pay heed to loosers like that. He should have said, "Ja tere ko jo karna hai kar le, meri jaane jutti."</h1>
