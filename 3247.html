<p>19, m
(its a bit long)
Hey all, I'm in a state of quandary from the last few days. I'm totally perplexed and confused after what happened b/w me and a very special friend of mine. Help me out pals.</p>
<p>He is guy whom I came across online, actually another online friend introduced both of us. Since then (two months or so), we are chatting and now we both know each other very much. We share almost everything. I was into him ever since we started talking. I even told him that I like him just after a week. But he advised me not to be in any hurry and to move with the flow. I agreed. We guys are not bfs but still that bonding b/w us is no less than those in a relation. Maybe, its only me who is having such feelings.</p>
<p>So this continues for over two moths and I'm falling more n more for him everyday. He never reflects any such feeling directly but my instinct says that he too likes me to some extent as we talk for hours and about everything.
So here is what happened. He has other online friends too. He says that except for me and the guy who introduced us, he doesn't talk to others that much. He meets his special online friends if he finds them good in nature. He has met quite a few guys since we started chatting. And he tells me everything about who he meets. I started feeling a bit possessive about him and i told him that its not safe or good to meet people who you dont know that much. He said he doesnt meet everybody but only those who he thinks are OK. I was still not convinced. May be because of my insecurity of loosing him to others. I asked him if we should meet someday but he refused saying he wants to meet me when he is totally free of his chores. He said he would meet me very soon. After this he again meets a guy a few days back and told me about it. It made me a little sad and worried too. I didnt want to say this to him directly, but i ended our chat abruptly that day. I was miffed actually.He got a sense about it. Next day he asked me about my reaction. I told him what was in my mind. I was angry and expressed my displeasure over him denying meeting me but having time to meet other guys. He tried to console me but i made it worse by escalating the debate. He then told me not to be possessive about him and not to ruin our friendship. I tried to understand his view and apologised. I accepted my mistake and said sorry. I thought he was right and i should not act foolishly.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make things perfect again as they were. But i'm seeing a change in him. He has started avoiding me. He talks to me when i text him he seems not to be interested anymore. His way of talking is changed. He is busy whenever i text him. I apologised again and again and again. He says i dont need to say sorry, he is fine.
I am a little depressed since then. I dunno what to do and how to handle the situation. I don't want to loose him. I don't want to be in any hurry as fas as relationship is concerned. How do i make things same as they were earlier? Its killing me from inside.... :'(</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you made a mistake and you realized it. Now it was upon him to be normal with you. Which he is being not. What you can do is that you talk with him and let him speak his mind. Don't say sorry anymore. It is already done. You can not text him either for sometime and see if he initiates the chat or not. If he doesn't then, I guess you should leave him alone to his thoughts.</h1>
