<p>Hi Admin, i want to ask something to u...</p>
<p>I am a gay guy posted confession a year ago saying about my crush on a straight guy whom i met in Bhopal. Here i want to ask to u is that now i m in Canada and he is in India but we talk on skype and facebook. He is planning to go New Zealand and he is doing ielts test preparation for that and i am helping him for that because he is not good at English. When ever i see him on skype i always fall in love with him and cannot take my eyes off from him, he is so charming and cute. Sometimes i fell like not talking to him becoz i cannot be his love. So i told him many times not to talk to me, but after some days i dont know how we start talking again. one week ago i did the same, i told him not to talk to me but after 3 days i kept one condition i front of him, was that i will talk to him till i finish my responsibility of teaching him through skype and then when he goes New zealand we will stop talking to each other and we would nt have any contact in future..after knowing this he accepted my condition saying that he dont want to be selfish but he really need my help right now, so he had to accept my condition. then from next day i started teaching him, then after teaching he asked me y i always do that, then all of a sudden he asked me r u not interested in girls? this question shook me away. i replied him saying anything else to ignore that question, but he again asked me that dont u want to get married and all, then i replied NO i dont want to. I think he have some doubt about my sexuality.
So Admin i was thinking to tell him about me that i m gay and i love him since very long time, and this i will tell him when we will have our last talk...What would u suggest me should i tell him that..bcoz i cannot keep this in my heart any more, it hurts really, i love him so much and i want to spend my whole life with him..i dont bother if he dont accept my proposal, i just want him to know that how much i love him...If u want to suggest me secretly, then i would appreciate that. I really want to talk to u more Admin.
Thank u.</p>
<h1>Viv- All these feeling are bottling up inside you and you cannot take it anymore, right? Well as far as your privacy is concerned(if you are closeted) and if he isn't in any contact with other people you know then by all means you should tell him and be free of the burden that you have on your heart. If you won't tel him then you cannot let the feelings go. You have thought about it totally correctly and in mature way.</h1>
