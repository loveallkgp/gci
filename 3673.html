<p>Hail to the LGBT community,dream of equality and acceptance in soceity when they themselves discrminating people and rejecting their own people.This way they would get equality and accptance in society just by talks.If they think they r gonna get equality this way then they r most stupid people.U would get equality and accptance bcz of ur acts of accptance of ur own people with diffrnt taste.Change begins from you then expect others to change for you and accpt u for who u are</p>
<p>I m just fucked up seeing this Sushant's confessions and posts on my newsfeed.I feel laughing to the idiots and uneducated people who are relating diffrnt life-style and sexuality.These two things are totaly different and nowhere related to eachother but people are trying to link sexuality,gender and life-style all together.</p>
<p>I have a question to the Gay and Bisexual people.Its just question don't get offended since there is a reason and message which i want to convey to you all.</p>
<p>My question for all people here is "If ur sister is raped by group of guys,would u leave her just bcz she is innocent bt society if defaming ur whole family memebers because of ur sister who is innocent and did nothing wrong ?? Would u support her in that situation when she needs u most or throw her out bcz of the taunts getting by society ??</p>
<p>As far as i know,mostly answer would be yes u would support her in that worst situation when she is innocent and being defamed for no reason.Same i want to say about girlish guys hijda and trans people,.when they r being abused by gay and bisexual people itself then what do u expect from us ?? They are people who are identified easily who face more emotional issues,face more problms and discrmination,rejected by their own friends family members don't have gud friend-circle just bcz they are girlish.So being girlish is in his hand ? U think of yourself why one would chose a life-style where there are thorns evrywhere in way instead of smooth road comparitively like you people ???? Its bcz its not choice to act girlish or be hijda or trans its same as ur feelings which can't be controlled but comes itself.</p>
<p>I always loved and adored LGBT community.Let me let you all,real educated people know that gays are manly or boyish but you can't deny the fact that girly people also exist in gay community which is absoultely okay just like in hetro-community girlish guys and boyish-girl exists it doesn't mean all girls are boyish or all guys are girlish its same with gay community so chill-out and love girly people as urself they need your love,ur support since they can be identified by haters easily therefore they face lot more discrmination than you people.Love your own people who are like you but little different from you at times.They are ur own family members its duty of evry individual to support ur own kind with different taste and likings.If u would start hating your own family member just bcz ur family is being defamed by haters for no reason.</p>
<p>This is so unexpected and disgusting to see all Gay people here fighting with each other and hating each other because of Sushant being girlish and representing Gay people on national television.Defaming sushant by calling him hijda chakka.I want to know if Hijdra and chakka people are bad that u r usingsuch terms to abuse someone ?? I should instead use Gay term to abuse others then how would u feel it ? i knw its pathetic but thats what u people are doing.Just like hetro people use "SALA GAY HAI" to abuse their friends likewise u people are using""Hijda Chakka" who are part of ur community which different lifestyles and tastes.Respect all.We are human before being Gay bisexual trans lesbian.You talk of equality but discrminating people themselves.Idiots</p>
<p>Being Gay i just want to carry a message to evryone out there.Love ur own people who need more n more support of their family members(LGBT) when discrminated by others.Where should they go if u only would hate them.To whom they should share their problms ???</p>
<p>My question about rape was related to this only.Just like a victim has no hands to defame u or ur family likewise girlish people are nt defaming ur commuity too.Work of society is to hate someone or the other and this would be continued it doesn't mean u start hating evry innocent people who is little different from you</p>
