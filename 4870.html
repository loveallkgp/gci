<p>Well its not a confession it's just something I'll like to share I opened a fake account about 2 months back found different kind of people...Fell in love for second time ( first time with a girl n now not to mention that m a bi ) Anyways my second love he turned out to b fake, Badly hurt, deactivated the account, but soon came back, n the day I reactivated I got a request from a random guy at 2 o clock midnight...Talked to him, he had fears regarding his sexuality being the "only son" of family....We exchanged numbers the very night itself...Got to kno each other even better....Felt for each other.. I proposed him though initially he was reluctant but later agreed....N something worth mentioning is that v both are from two different cities, he's top gay n m top bi still we love each other n going good till now....Yes v fight a lot but at the end of day can't sleep without saying love u to each other........We don't know what future has for us but we want to live our present together So boys yha I wanna tell love can happen again n again distance n sexual prefrances doesn't matter if u actually love someone</p>
