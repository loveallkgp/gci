<p>I am 24 year old from ranchi. I am not sure if i am girly gay or transexual. I get attracted to guys but want them to love me like a girl. In porn i watch straight porn and feel as if im the girl with me having vagina. I imagine to be married and live like straight couple. However i dont hate my male body which is read online that all trans hate their body and penis and want sex change. When i used to do any girly thing my dad used to beat me and not give me food that day. My brother called me hijda for many years and in school other kids and teachers used to torture me if i acted like girl. I tried suicide once but was saved by doctors. I dont know if i have suppressed trans feelings or i am actually gay.</p>
<h1>GCI- Whatever you are or however you feel is completely okay. You love your male body and don't want to get changed, then you are gay. Don't go for my words alone. Only you can find out about yourself.</h1>
<p>What concerned me about you is the reaction of your dad and brother. They are so consumed by the idea of masculinity that they drove you to suicide? That is so much inhuman! Get out of the place if you can after you make a career.</p>
