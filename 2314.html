<p>Well , I feel really astonished to see the atitude of ppl towards gay , LGBT Community outside the metro cities... I want to share the experience with you yesterdy while watching Humshakals in Kurukshetra , there was a hooting , nd boys were whistling like hell over a gay scene nd were making fun.. and most of the crowd was aged under 25 only ...</p>
<p>Ufff by seeing this i feel really sorry for LGBT comm nd yaar they all were educated atlst school to attend kiya hi hoga. nd kurukshetra has really good universities i think.. still ye sab ??</p>
<p>P.S. - mentioning of Kurukshetra city is just an example nd based on personal experience... I really dont want to hurt an1's sentiments.. sorry if i did so....</p>
<h1>GCI- I completely understand your sentiments. Even the most educated ones can be douchebags sometimes. But we have to also blame the so called disaster of the movies who promote LGBT stuff in the ridiculous sense.</h1>
