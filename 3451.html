<p>Hello Admin..</p>
<p>I am in very Big trouble.. Even I cant take deep Breath...
May be I am in Love.. Last night I met with toooooooo sexy and toooooooo cute guy.. in park.. we both r bisexual.. we liked each other and we did some kisses and body love.. He said to me some loving words.. like sweetu, babu,,etc... which made me so romantic for him.. Then he also said to me that he wanna fuck me and wanna spend full night with me.. And for that we made plan for next Sunday.
But....... when we said Good Bye to each other.. he said to me that if I give some gifts to him it will make very happy for him.. and if I will be in my car.. it will be more comfortable for him.. He is 5 years less from my age.. I m into business and he is student.. so that i think he is only depend on his pocket money.. and as i m into business i have some money for spend and for enjoy..
Lastly I again say that he is very sweet and chatter box type guy.. I like him soooo much.. Now what i would do.. May I buy some gifts for him and arrange my car for him.. or what i would do.. Don't wanna loose him.. coz he is really very very very sexy and sweet guy..
Plz tell me admin.. Mere apne uper Control nahi ho pa raha... Dude.. Kya Karuin..????</p>
<h1>GCI- Darling, you met him in the park and did hanky panky stuff and then he said he wanna fuck you. I'd ask you to take it slow. I'm not being the buzzkill here but you really should let the testosterone level come down a bit and then think about it wisely.</h1>
