<p>Bro i want to know something.. Feeling frustrated frown emoticon Having friendship vit my friend for the past 6 yrs . first 3 years I know its normal friendship nly, frm 4th year I feel jealousy when he is getting close to anyone. I came to know that I'm truly in love with him. I didn't proposed him at that time , after that the distance between us is reduced we both say I love u so many times a day, endless speeches while sleeping, then we both kissed each other cheeks, eyes, forehead. We always hug each other to sleep. I think like he too hav the same feel like me. One day while he sleeping I kissed his lips n played with his body and Su<strong>ed his d</strong>k. I know he hav Wake up in middle of that thing. From the morning he avoids me n not speaks vit me as normal, I was cried n felt the depth of loneliness. That night he said sorry for the last night, I luv u as a frnd n just forget this. He requests me pls don't do that again . Then v came to normal life after 6 month without my control I did that same , but that time he did not speak n didn't bother about that so I started to play like couples, everything is normal, after some days he starts thinks about that again and worried. Sorry to say this I don't don't know why I'm allowing to do dat , but I don't want to do this anymore and this is not true friendship if we do like this .</p>
<p>He is allowed to S**k him not anything else . after every time he getting worried and saying don't do it again frown emoticon . I'm confused he is a straight r bi??.. But one thing is sure we loving each other so much.</p>
<p>Please help me what to do cry emoticon .
Any suggestions, waiting for the reply.</p>
<h1>GCI- As far as I can say that guy -</h1>
<p>1- Is getting oral pleasure from u for free.
2- He is just an asshole who is not into labeling himself apart from being nomenclatured straight.
3- U are acting the sex starved slash cliche gay guy after dicks and nothing else.
4- Ur friendship has a sexual angle due to sex suppressed environment.
5- U want to love him but are not able to sync it with ur bodily needs of carnal desires.</p>
<p>P.S- Either both of u are sex deprived and this starvation has led u both to think that it is another form of affection for each other and trust me its not love in the real sense, its just the matter of being with each other for a temporary phase of ur life.</p>
<p>Q.E.D- U must understand that ur decision to be with him are from one side and very silly and he is not at all reciprocating anything. LEAVE THIS TOXIC RELATIONSHIP ONCE AND FOR ALL!</p>
