<p>These kids are growing so fast
I always wondered whether i could come out to my family. I somehow always wanted my sister to be first as she has always been forthright about people's right. But i never heard her saying anything positive about gays.Come one summer i saw a rainbow flag on her room's door!</p>
<p>Anyways after knowing her views on the topic i felt a burden lifted from me as i could come out to her. And I did. To my surprise she was more like indifferent. She said its ok you are not a criminal (as if i didn't know that already!) She accepted me for who I am. She told me she was disappointed that i had not found a boyfriend yet. Anyways after this we bonded on this gay thing. We talked about guys we like. Our future and stuff.</p>
<p>Like an ideal sister she teases me whenever a hot guy passes around! Once in swimming pool i saved a boy(rather good looking i must say) from drowning and while he was thanking me my sister with her Cheshire grin signaled me to give him THE kiss of life! We have become comfortable in each others presence now.</p>
<p>She tells me her friends both boys and girls now support gay rights (after she convinced them). Damn she has a gay friend too who is accepted in her group. And to think of it she is 15 years old and from a small hilly town of population 30,000. DAMN THESE KIDS! oUr FUTURE IS BRIGHTER THAN it APPEAR! :D :D (Y)</p>
<h1>GCI- You had me at Cheshire grin! OMG! Your sister is so cool! God bless you both!</h1>
