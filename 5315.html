<p>Simple problem is.
I love a gay guy very deeply. Never expressed though. He considers me only as a good friend. He has a crush on some other guy.
I somehow manage to accept the reality nd try to move on but fail everytime we talk. He is a friend, so I obviously can't stop talking to him. But I get only confused, sad nd depressed when I talk to him. Because when I talk to him I get to know that I'm just a friend, that he likes someone else nd he treats me a a friend only.</p>
<p>Sometimes I manage. Today I'm just ij too much pain. Neither can I stop talking to him nor can fake that I'm happy, excited to know that he's dating someone else.</p>
<h1>GCI- Aaahh the unrequited love. We all have that. Sorry boo, but come out of it. It's the only way. I had that too, but then I got out of it and the guy and I am the BFFs.</h1>
