<p>Hey there! I have recently started writing a story. Story of a young boy who is infatuated with a policeman who lives in the neighborhood as a paying guest. Here is the CHAPTER 1 : </p>
<p>A TWIST IN THE TALE. I would like it to reach to the people of our community. The gay community to which the story is related to. So if you guys have no issues with it. Please post it on the page. </p>
<p>"I live here only because of you two brothers" said the man with dark black eyes, equally black hairs; nicely groomed above his clean shaven fair toned face. he rose to his full height. Straightening his yellow Royal Enfield bike, with a siren on each side, a shade or two lighter than his Delhi Police uniform. The man was in his mid 40s, 6 feet tall, well built and a charming smile. The boy being addressed looked slim and smart in his loose outfit. He was a tad short. His wheatish complexion being yellowed under the street lights which looked happy hearing those lines. I live here only because of you two brothers. Telling to himself. He bowed a little in front and said "Thank You" acknowledging the appreciation. "I will dance in your wedding" said the Policeman kickstarting his bike. The 20 years old lad gave a skeptical look but replied with "I will be glad to see that". With that they both raised their hands making a gesture quite similar to a salute. All fingers joined. Placed on the forehead on an edge, pointing to sky and giving it a little jerk. The ice was broken with the badd-badd of policeman's bike and he left adjusting himself to the seat. After the man left, the boy looked elated. This was so far the best thing he has heard from him, his crush . He could still hear the echo of his words, rushing towards the adjacent house. He climbed three steps unbolted the gate, entered and bolted it again</p>
