<p>i know they r going to torment him bcs of being too loud..hell u cud even see tht when they said lets stop luggage of tht guy who wears tht much makeup....tht gay...and this was nothing,even thn i felt bad..things are going to be way way bad for him :( ... previous seasons had all those were whacky lgbt ppl..he seems just a boy...as much as i think him not to be representative a whole spectrum of diverse community..i still want him protected....mn :/</p>
<h1>GCI- Well it goes like this, people only know how to criticize. We all have ridiculous egos in us that we cannot see someone different representing us. Also, things aren't going to be bad for him. For him, the word gay isn't an abuse like it is for most of the people here. He is in the house with those people who are in the showbiz and showbiz  industry is filled with gay people. Its the outside, the haters and especially homophobic homosexuals who are the real threat to him. Either way no matter how much hate one spews, the producers will kick him out if he is too good, or will keep him if he does drama. No matter if you vote or not it won't be counted because the producers want their money to be worth it.</h1>
<p>Also, all of this hate isn't gonna push him into the shell. He is already very successful and this bigg boss is gonna make him even more. So hate all you want but this is not gonna put any black spot on him at all.</p>
