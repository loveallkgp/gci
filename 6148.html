<p>This should never happen to a gay !</p>
<p>See, I am not interested in receiving love proposals in Facebook. I dont know I got actually some 4 - 5 all of which I rejected. Right now i am not interested / dont have belief in the Institution of marriage. I had those fairy tale love / crush over straights in my college in my twenty one which I could not get rid of of my mind. They stay as pleasant memories.</p>
<p>Now, a well settled straight, a wonderful character ( certain things can be understaood if we Analyse from the way their mind works ), he is somewhat good looking and bcame a fb friend with whom i was having a sex Chat in my fake Profile ( his being original Profile ) in These days. He never looked on any Girl as he was looking for right Kind of Girl in his life ( he is straight for sure, may be 0.01 % bi ) He today expressed his Feelings for him with much hesitation. He said he is bit confused about all this.</p>
<p>So I explained him that He is actually straight and since he was single for a very Long time and the few romantic and lovable words that I spoke to him during those sex Chat filled his emotional vacuum and this is not really "falling for me". Also I told Long distant relationships, even if he happened to be gay or bi, will not work ( both are in 2 diff countries outside India ) Then he became Little clear but quite satisfied with my answer :)</p>
<p>But he is such a wonderful guy. good looking, tall, settled, owning house, no parents Problem, matured Kind, hearted, understandable, etc and falling for me ! I am not at all being pompous but I received other proposals from well settled good looking gays. Only i didnt make any step :( I just dont have the emotional bottle within me to pour it on somebody and fall in love. What I want ( my college day crushes ) I am not getting, but what i can possibly be happy with, I am getting, but I dont want.</p>
<p>All I aks Lord Ram is to send me my own dream man, one of those straights, whom i truly had crush on ! :( </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, we all have our expectation but they should at least make some sense. You cannot ask to settle down with a straight man. There should not be anything said about this matter.</h1>
<p>And about your college day crushes, darling they are a thing of past. You cannot live in the past and deny the chance for future. You have to get out of your comfort zone and leave that glitch in your life which is holding you back.</p>
