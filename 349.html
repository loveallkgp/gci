<p>hello everyone.
I met this 28 yo handsome hunky guy in wechat. am 23 yo. that very evening I met him and I told him am gay, he wasn't surprised as he had suspected that. we had beer, drove in car whole night, chatted about many things,. it was a wonderful time. but he told me that he is straight and even has a gf but gonna break up with her soon. when I asked him why he met me then he said that he liked me and am beautiful and cute and blah..blah... I was confused . we met a few times after that and had really wonderful moments.I even told him that I like him and if he was gay I would go in a relationship with him. finally on our fifth meet he told me that he want to make out with me. I was like really??? and he was serious. so we started. he was nervous as it was his first time with a guy. I gave him bj for some time which he really enjoyed but when I started kissing him and hugging. he said he is feeling awkward. so I stopped at that moment. it was embarassing. but we are still in touch.
what should I do now?? should I continue meeting him??? if he wanna have sex again should I try ?? I think he is bi- curious</p>
<p>agra</p>
<h1>Viv- You could continue meeting him but make it non intimating. Hang out like two next door boys. If he says anything to try some action, its upon you to decide whether you want it or not because honey you are not someone's or anyone's toy. And you do not exist for anyone's timely pleasures.</h1>
