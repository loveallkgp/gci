<p>Here is something which i thought i always had and soon realised that life gives it to you but never lets you have it because it was never yours. So here i am writing a little one on one to my heart and when i mean heart i also mean to the one's close to my heart.</p>
<p>It was a new feeling, a fresh breath of air, soon came autumn which never gave me that flair,
I was young and restless as to what it was,
how would i know that you were the cause?
you changed my life so soon,
just like a butterfly coming out of it's cocoon.</p>
<p>I always thought this love was unconditional,
it didnt take a second to turn me so emotional,
I saw you from above, waved, stared, adored,
here you were to take my heart away!
I knew you were mine from the word go,
Oh baby hell you were my marylinn munrow!</p>
<p>I told you, you were my prince,
then came a wind full of total mess.
God always does this to its loved one's,
and here i was to be taken far away,
to let our love talk and guide it's way!
I didnt know the REAL life was here,
everyday, every minute was so unfair.</p>
<p>Bieng far away from you wasnt easy,
when you always thought i was acting fake and cheesy!
I developed anger, hatred with no mercy,
and it all came on you like a pile of arrogance stuffed inside a turkey!
You told me i wasnt in love,
how should i tell you that i was no less than an onion trapped inside its clove.</p>
<p>I knew that you were going far away into the unknown,
which led my life to do nothing but moan.
You thought someone could replace me,
who could kill your sadness and sorrow!
baby why didnt you know that with him there was no tommorow?</p>
<p>I tried everything possible!
Hearts broke, loved seemed like it has lost its meaning,
Then came a new season with a flower swinging.
I tried bieng by your side trying to do the unthinkable,
Doing what i could for you was evrytime miserable!</p>
<p>Sometimes after all we have been through,I sit down and ask myself whether he really loves me,
I always get the potrait of your face when i close my eyes saying yes!
Baby all i am asking you is to show you faith and love,
just like with someone you had no tommorowother wise the powerful force of love will always be in sorrow.</p>
<p>You gave a new meaning to the word 'me' to 'us'
all i wanna tell you that i only need love and not lust.
If this one on one means anything to you,
then someday you will call me and say '
I LOVE YOU'.</p>
