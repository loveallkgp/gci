<p>Hey guyz , ..... Its been almos a year we r in relationship....sometimes we fight ,though it doesn't last for long.... N m always d first person to seek for forgiveness as i do regard my relationship more dan my egO.... But now m tired up of hodin dis shit relationship .... Even though he love me ,he lack Caring which is a must in relationship.....  He is 31 n i m 19..... He's still not gettin married jus bcoz of me inspite of his family's wish.... I do love him alot but m tired of holdin up..... I can't forget him but m thinkin of breakin up ..... I don't no wat would become of me after he left me or vice versa....  He too has changed a lot..... No more phone calls .... Frequent Call waiting..... :'( ....</p>
<h1>Viv- Okay, first of all you dont have to whine like, "oh what would become of me if my bf leaves me." There are other major things in life that require your attention than a fucked up relationship. Amd honey, if you really think that holding it all together is really melancholic then take your decision. Do whatevee that makes you happy. Your happiness is most important. You are just 19 and trust me it is a very young age to be in a committed relationship amd very few can handle it. You must explore your potentials. If something is not according to what you want then do think about it.</h1>
