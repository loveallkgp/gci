<p>"there is one guy in our class and he's a bisexual, he is extremely popular, he has got friends, he is so skilled, he is a rising teen celebrity (we are in college actually) and he took away all my friends...i never was used to feel jealous and i don't even want to but it just make me to feel so, i am not open when it comes  to sexuality , neither he is
...only few people know. i know i shouldn't get jealous because he is getting deserving attention but when i see my freinds with him, i just go crazy, my jealous has reached to such a peak that i want to kill me ( i am sorry!)...plus i want to say another thing that probably i am getting mad, i may be declared clinically insane if i get checked, my behaviour is already tagged abnormal by some people...i am always confused...i...don't know what to do...i am lonely, i don't have even one friend, everyone is so busy, that guy is the most favoured personality of our class that people have forgotton me...same with my friends...plus i always stay locked up in room whenever i am in PG...and  i can't make new friends because as i said i am confused, i hold the desire to make new friend but i just don't want to, i want to fall in love and have a partner but i just again don't want to do so...it's only lonliness in the air which surrounds me...it's only silence which my ear can catch...i am thinking of leaving college and joining sanitorium..."</p>
<h1>gci- There is something called being optimistic in life. You need that. Badly. If your so called friends left you for another person they were never your friends. Leave him, them and everyone be. You focus on yourself and try to socialize with others. Dont wait for anyone to come to you cuz no one will. Accept the reality and work accordingly.</h1>
