<h1>GCI- So sorry for you buddy. A three year old relationship isn't an easy one to forget. But you do forget it in the long run. To completely move on you have to find pleasure in some other things. Forget meeting new guys for dating and hook ups. Focus on your studies and your future. Don't let one incident in your life to put yourself down. Rather rise from the ground with an obsession to make a change in your life. If you continue to be sad, you will reach nowhere. Whatever happened, was on your ex. Now your actions will determine your future. Make your actions worth good.</h1>
