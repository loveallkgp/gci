<p>Dear admins, first let me thank you for this fantastic page. It gives us one of those rare platforms to confess things which many of us may have no other place or person to share with. It also gives us insight into thoughts of fellow gay guys. Also thank you for taking time to add your own opinions, which are often useful. I also have few suggestions. As some have already complained earlier, postings are far too apart and timing unpredictable. That could be one of the reasons for dismal number of comments and interactions on each confession, for such a widely followed page. I understand that you guys own this page and have right to decide when and what to post. I also understand you guys must be busy with your own life, study, job, etc. But unfortunately for us, there is hardly any other comparable Indian gay confessions page available. So most of us will be very eagerly waiting for our own confessions to be posted, and for others' confessions. Some of the confessors may need immediate suggestions on certain situations (eg: Confession #7620). And the wait sometimes can be quite frustrating. I have 2 specific suggestions to improve this situation both for you and us. </p>
<ol>
<li>Take in more admins. It is hard for just 2 guys to actively maintain this page. I'm sure many guys here will be willing to join the team if you wish. I myself am willing to contribute some time.</li>
<li>If you cannot increase the frequency of postings, atleast fix specific days for posting (eg: every Sunday), so that we dont have to check the page for updates so often. If, for some reason, you are too busy to post for a long time, take just a minute to convey that to us, including when approximately we can expect the next post.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope I'm not asking for too much. This page has potential for far more interaction and discussion  that can be so useful to many of us. Let us all together make it more lively! Cheers!</p>
<h1>GCI- We are surely working out to be more regular here and to create a schedule, because we both are having some issues. Also, we both have studies as well that is taking a lot of time of our lives. Thank you for the suggestions, we will surely take note.</h1>
