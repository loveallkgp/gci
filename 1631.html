<p>$ABBY ; see he just being caring and affectionate . it might be he isn't having any younger brother and thinks of you as his younger brother . so just chill and don't think his care as part of ' flirting ' . love has many types and he might be showering ' brotherly love ' . and about whatspp chats see there are many men who keep on phone all day all night always talking and staying busy in devices . they mostly have big strong social circle . andthey like having chats ...you can say thats how they socialize and entertain themselves . part of hobby you can say too. so he is just socializing . </p>
<p>take care .</p>
