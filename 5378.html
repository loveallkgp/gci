<p>i dont know why i m writing this but my life is a complete mess.....
people say that grandparents are the best but i beg to differ
i hate my dada because my grandpa used to sexually abuse me.
he first had sex me when i was 7 years old...
i thought that it was some play but then he continued it
my parents came to know about it we moved to another place
pr ye bat fel gyi thi
mere sschool me pta chal gya tha to sabhi mere ko ajeeb dhang se dekhte the.
bullying got a new level in my case
class 9 tak i lost my confidence
one day some people cornered me in the toilets and raped me. i couldnt do anything
my parents got to know about all of it and they changed my school
till not things are a little fine but there is this giant hole in my brain which is dark and takes me to a blank space.
i dont know if i can be happy
i dont know if someone will accept me with my past
i dont know if i can ever have my confidence back
i have no friends no bf no one to talk to</p>
<p>this is the darkest part of my life and i don't know how to deal with this</p>
<h1>GCI- And some people cry for having sex with a straight guy. Hang in there buddy. You are strong. You have survived this far. Focus on your life now. Become a totally new person. Work for yourself. You can and you will come out of it.</h1>
