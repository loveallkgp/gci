<p>Hi Im from Chennai! Im 21 yrs old male...i have been friends with a guy since 2 years...we see each others as best pals it was all good till i got separated from his after i had to pursue my studies elsewhere...days passed and i started missing his company and started contacting him through sms and fb chats...everytime he said he had found a girl i would feel jealous...not of him but of her!!! i unknowingly started to like him like a lover...but yet never showed him my feelings...i wanted him to know my feelings and change his to mine...i created a fake profile on fb in a girl's name and started texting him through it...he also was responding well..after a few months he asked for a sex chat and i said yes(from the fake profile) slowly we started it and it gave tremendous erection when he used to say how big his dick is and all...i couldn't control myself but as it was a fake profile i had to act like a girl...and so i did! we did some sex chats and he was fully addicted to it..he used to force me for it then i got a plan...we made a deal..i asked him if he would answer all my dirty questions for a sex chat? he said ok! Then i started asking gay questions and telling him gay stories! he used to feel embarrassed at 1st but then started answering...one of my question was "how would tell you best friend that you have a gay feeling on him without opening your mouth?" he said "me and my best friend always go on a walk at night times i would touch his back while swinging my arms and then get an erection and would make his swinging arm touch my erected dick" This literally gave me goosebumps and started wanking at his msgs...i morphed his photos to gay pictures and masturbate seeing them...Now presently Im in my home town met him a couple of days back he's normal but i have changed a lot...he called me home i went and in his room we were talking about what all happened here without my presence and i hardly was listening to him..i just kept on starting at his lips and used to touch his chest part at times when he used to crack jokes just in the name of a missed high five and stuff...i seriously am.mad about him...i want his white ass</p>
<h1>Viv- What in the name of God did I just read? The worst possible thing you could do is make a fake profile and that too of a girl and text straight guys for sex or relationship purposes. I mean there is plenty of gay meat around. Why not look for it?</h1>
