<p>so there is this guy who claims he loves me n want to meet me. i knw he is quiet sad and lonely in his life bcz he lost his parents in early age. bt i dun want to, i hv met many guys they were jst frnds n still how they treated me after n during meeting only i knw. i look somewhat okay but its my personality or wt i dun knw thats quiet strange that people run away from me. i dun want that i meet  him n gt ignored one more time, i m ignoring him, insulting him but he is still sticking, i feel really bad even more  than him bcz i feel fr him too but i knw wt i faced previously. he jst see me by pics only .. how to face this situation admin? wt to do so that he goes away frever.. i have even said its over many times but he said sorry n i cnt be that heartless. n other point is he is descent he cn gt many guys out there thn y he is doing so? m all confused..</p>
<h1>GCI- Try to address his issues and ur  issues at the same time by an analytical psychological insight of ur and then of him second.</h1>
<p>BTW, u must not treat people like shit and must not get treated likewise, but remember if someone has psychological issues..there is always a shrink next door....GET OVER THE STIGMA of going to a psychiatrist....for heaven's sake!</p>
