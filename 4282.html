<p>Hi Admin,
My name is Ricky. I want your advice on something. Recently, I felt the need to come out. So I tried to come out to the person whom I supposed to be least homophobic. He is my friend and we have known each other from long time. I told him that I don't ever want to marry. He started lecturing me why we need to marry, family stuff etc. etc. ... but not even once asked the obvious question WHY? Without him asking me that question, I failed to have the courage to say it. Do you think he already knows about me? Or is he in denial? It's like you just started your journey and are hit by a major roadblock. Please help.</p>
<h1>GCI- No, he is just being the typical Indian guy with a typical Indian teachings burned in his head where career settlement is not necessary but marriage and having kids for the family and to show the society is an absolute necessity. You should have a hint from his thinking that right now he is not the right person to whom you should come out. I know that these feelings are there. But they fade away with some time. This pressure is temporary. So chill down, relax and don't think much about it.</h1>
