<h1>Viv- Are you kidding me? How is that even a solution? Ek breakup hota nai ki poori duniya se naata todna sacha lagta hai. Come on and be a man. There are tons of people who have gone through breakup shit and still they are surviving. LOOK AT ME. I had the terrible break up as well and I'm still here and hoping for the best in life. My ex don't deserve me so I'm waiting for the right one. Seriously if you were infront of me I would have scolded you bad. Do not take any decision at which you will regret brutally at the later stage.</h1>
