<p>Four years ago, I met an 18 year old guy. He was cute, nice and very friendly. He was also a talented pianist and a good singer.</p>
<p>We met on facebook by accident. But we began to chat. Weeks later, we met for the first time.</p>
<p>It was at night, and I met him outside his hostel. I waited for minutes before he arrived. He looked nervous. I still remember looking at him for the first time and thinking, "He looks so young... and he has such a nice smile." He did.</p>
<p>That first night, we sat in the backseat of my car, holding hands and kissing. He was so shy. He could barely look at me. It was adorable.</p>
<p>We met a number of times after that. And eventually, I became the one who took his virginity away.</p>
<p>Things were fine for some time. We were happy. But in the end, we both wanted different things. And I had to let him go...</p>
<p>He eventually found a different guy and moved on...</p>
<p>And as for me, I am still single... by choice. On most days, I am fine. But there are times when I miss him. And during those times, I can't help but wonder if he was the one that got away... and that hurts... &lt;3</p>
