<p>Hi I am 22.. I met this guy through a friend of mine.. he himself is bisexual.. we met on 29th April on Skype chat.. we chatted, shared about our lives and got to know each other very nicely.. next day we met casually as my place wasn't free.. so we met at a Ganga ghat.. on the 3rd day we made out at our place and trust me we both never felt that way ever.. he said me I love you n I didn't bother and was just lying.. later we started meeting each other on a daily basis for almost whole day as he was supposed to leave the city so we had very less time approx 13 days more with us.. we wanted to have the most of it.. he said me how he got into guys, I said mine.. we got closer.. he felt of me as an elder brother and I started feeling for him.. we became mad for each other .. we couldn't bear a minute's separation.. I never said him that I love him.. although we both used to say I love u .. I need u.. and all.. he always wanted me to just hug him n cuddle him tightly in bed or outside and Kiss him on his forehead.. we used to cry with the thought of staying away.. we exchanged gifts.. I made him meet my friends.. famiky.. everyone I could in that limited time dividing our personal time with them...so the day came for him to leave.. and it became tougher for us to live.. I said him I love you not as a brother but as a Lover... and he himself knows how badly I love him.. I expressed him everything abt my feelings.. he said I too love u but as an elder bro first n den as a Lover..  I said him may b u r scared to lose me and so u r scared to b in relationship with me.. one day he broke with his gf and he proposed me.. n I was like so happy but then I wanted him to Think and n den he apologised for it... now that he is coming back here.. it's becoming very tough for me to not love him because I love him very badly n I don't know how to be his forever.. I was a sex freak.. now I have left all those for him as he doesn't like.. I don't even meet any guys.. he is jealous of all my frnds.   He cannot share me.. I feel likewise but since he does all these I feel somewhere he loves me but I don't know .. i need help...</p>
<h1>GCIL- This is gonna get bad..real bad...leave each other asap....that will suffice.</h1>
