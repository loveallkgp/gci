<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A huge thanks for coming up with such a good and motivating platform. I really admire what you are doing.
I am a 26 years old guy from Himachal Pradesh. I know who I am and have accepted myself. I have this fake account for so long. But haven't found any one for me. I have observed people here are only for NSA or hool ups. Nobody wants to be loved.</p>
<p>I am fed up of all this. Why people are so? I couldn't understand.
Sometimes I feel so lonely and feel like I will end up in depression.
Why can't people understand what love is?
I can't even share all this with anyone, not even with my bff. So am writing up here. I don't know what destiny has in store for me.
I feel so much emotionally devastated sometimes. Its so difficult to a find a person who understands you and be there you in this anti country.</p>
<p>I feel so broken up.</p>
<p>Please suggest what should I do.</p>
<ul>
<li>A follower and Admirer.</li>
</ul>
<h1>GCI- As one great woman once said, "Henny if you can't love yourself, how the hell you are gonna love somebody else?" First try to get yourself back together from the emotions. Being emotional is good but living your life based on them is foolish. There are other things in your life as well that are just as interesting. Don't run for anything in your life. It will automatically come to you when the time is right.</h1>
