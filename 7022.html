In my whole life knw I m 28 I have never fantasize abt girls there are always boys , n whenever I m trying to be with girls in my thinking n fatasy  things are not satisfactory , due to this I dont want  to get marry n  I m always  neglecting  diff proposal  ...jub bhi bat chalti h  m koi na koi bahana bana deta tha ladki thik nhi ye vo ..but this time  under pressure lots of pressure of family ..mujy han kahna pada  ..again many  try kia papa ko bola mujhy sadi nahi karni  he sadi  tere andar koi kami h kya  ..itna bada ho gya h  saram nahi ati  ..sadi nahi karega to majak ban jaega ..

<h1>GCI- OK! calm down first of all. An dlet me speak now for godsake!</h1>
<p>This happens when u don't take stands for ur life and believe in that shitty notion of parents bhagwaan hote hain...Like really man if that would had been the case toh woh sab jaante apne bachhe k baare me and would have dealt with it accordingly.
With due respect to ur parents let me throw some light on some grave issues-
1- Only u know what can be the best outcome provided u can really take a stand for urself now.
2- U must understand that gay men are also forbidden to marry according to the Shastras if am not exaggerating.
3- U must now understand that its a do or die situation or u can act cool and calm and say that if they force marriage on you u will leave the house forever( better be prepared for such for a short span of time.)
4- U can consult the Humsafar trust or any other NGO dpending on the location of your area and city.
5- U must now realise the fact that this is why we need gay ryts which includes the right to marry bcoz in doing so innocent lives shall be saved( of urs and that girl's).
6- This page or its members are not a magic wand for you to flee the situation and put u in Narnia through your closet. REALISE THE FACT THAT U R GAY AND NOW IS THE TIME TO ACCEPT YOURSELF IN FRONT OF THE FAMILY OR TO URSELF.
7- U must understand that crying, weeping or sulking or even marrying is not the solution to any of your problem.
8- Talk to people who are out, watch videos of them, talk to those on how they did it and then make peace with your life.
9- 'Mazaak' tab banega jab logon ko yeh pata chalega k tumne shaadi apni sexuality chhupane k liye ki aur ese cases baddh rahe hain.Newspapers and channels are after such news like jackals.
10- U need to visit a psychiatrist if u want 2 get assured of ur sexuality( not required for sexuality though) as per your mental state needs more of clinical help.</p>
<p>THOSE WHO RISE MAKE OTHERS RISE WITH THEM AND THOSE WHO FALL MAKE MANY OTHERS FALL WITH THEM....CHOOSE YOUR SIDE WISELY.</p>
<p>P.S-  Married gay men can NEVER be happy, satisfied or be of sound mental health bcoz that is equal to making an apple an orange and expecting it to be an orange for others and itself.
U can check our page too where we recently shared such a plight of a married gay man whose wife divorced him within a week after knowing his truth.</p>
