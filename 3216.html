<p>Hi guys......
I am 23 years old from delhi.... Sometime i wonder what life wants from me or where am i heading.... When i was just 10 years old i was sexually used by my elder cousin brother for many years. When he left my desire increased and i wanted more of that. I was fat and dark so nobody liked me in that sense. First time i masturbated i was 14 years old and it was accidental. I was all alone. At 13, i lost my real sister. Many friends came and went and some are close friends but somethings u can't share with them.... Years past and my desire increased and so my frequency of masturbation. I like girls also but i never see them the way other guys or the way they comment bczz i respect girls. In 2012 i met a guy online named sanyam oberoi thought he would be a nice genuine guy but his actions and what i heard from others forced me to go away as i belong to very respected and sophisticated family. I met few guys but never had anal sex with anyone except foreplay. Finally i met a guy, with same thoughts and feelings. We both belong to different religion. He being muslim and i being hindu used to clash at many issues but at the end we were 1. He never loved me but was always over possessive about me. We had physical relation but not anal and we never desired still something is missing. I am missing that love, care which i shower on everyone around. I miss being loved..... I miss myself..... This post is a bit scattered but yeah i will bring out every aspect of my life in detail here only.... My good side and my dark side so that atleast you all can learn from my mistakes.</p>
