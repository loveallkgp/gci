<p>Hello all the beautiful people and amazing admins. 
This is Tarun here, your long time fan. I've been following this page for almost 2 years now and made some confessions before. But lately I got busy with studies and all that stuff, so I was a little inactive. But I'm back again, at least for a while. 
Now, I am going to rant about my life for a few minutes. If you have something important to do, then please skip. I'll write in points to make it easy for people to read and understand:
1. I'm gay: I don't know if I am really gay or not. I mean I jerk off to gay porn only. Straight porn kinda grosses me out. And once I watched lesbian stuff, I vomited (literally). But at times I feel attracted towards girls too. I have a few friends with whom I can flirt very easily and there is a girl I really like, not sexually but I like her (its complicated). And I sometimes enjoy looking at girls with my other friends, so sometimes i get doubtful. And I am a control freak so in such doubtful scenarios, I freak out.
Also I'm not comfortable with the idea of me coming out to my friends. I sometimes openly voice my opinions on gay rights and all that stuff. But when it comes to personal comments (in which my friends are PhD.s), I get really nervous. Sometimes I feel I am not doing justice to my community by not accepting myself openly. So you can say that I haven't accepted myself totally.
2. I'm out to parents: Yes, I am out to my parents. I came out 3 years back. It wasn't tough, neither was easy. They told me to take my time and clear out things. My mother is very supportive and I never had a talk with my father. But I know he's supportive too. I mean up to an extent. But sometimes I feel really bad about it. I mean they are so good and supportive and loving and all that, so I feel I am disappointing them. My brother is terminally ill, so I am kinda sole supporter of my family. But that's not the issue. The issue is the guilt I feel. And with the recent visits to home, I realized a tension is brewing. My extended family is pressurizing my parents to get me married. So my parents are very depressed. They are worried about my future. I told them that it won't be possible for me to marry a girl. But they are getting restless day by day. I am the eldest, so the obvious situation. I am 24 btw and my 23 year old cousin got married this Feb.
3. I am introvert: I am a little introvert in nature. Shy of talking to new people. And I really don't like random chats. I can discuss Syrian refugee crisis, latest episode of silicon valley or Ayn Rand's philosophy endlessly with my friends. But when it comes to talking to a relative or other gossips, its a massive turn off. My parents call me selfish due to being anti-social to my extended family. (Its not my fault that I don't talk to them, they are a bunch of hypocrites, misogynists and religious retards). And my parents don't respect my friends, so I don't respect theirs.
4. Love and sex life: I am going star in 40 year old virgin sequel. I have had a few (two) crushes, even fallen in love with my straight best friend (who doesn't). Things got real awkward so I backed off. Yeah it hurt, but I got over. Due to that episode, I don't trust people much. I mean I don't have many friends whom I can trust. So sometimes I feel that I failed in this department too. And one other thing, I think I am demisexual. So I really don't like sex dates. 
5. Career: This is something I can say I didn't disappoint anyone in. I am (post +) graduating this month from a prestigious engineering college. I have a high paying job offer which I'll be joining the next month. But here I disappointed myself. I didn't want to do engineering. Neither my parents forced me. I just did it because I didn't have any other choice. So I'm not complaining, but I am not happy either. Hope money keeps me interested. 
So, that's pretty much about me. I know it sounds like describing a first world life in a third world country. But yeah its my life. And I am proud of it. There are loopholes here and there, but I am happy. And yeah sometimes I do behave like kids.
If you have made it this far then thank you for reading. And thanks admin. You are doing a laudable job.</p>
<h1>GCIL- 5 points to u as well-</h1>
<p>1- Its okay to label or unlabel urself these days, that is what being lgbt or queer is all about. The truth as a whole in u being queer is bigger than the truth of u feeling fluid at times. Just relax and do not worry if u get girl crushes, even strt men have man crushes...what's the big deal dude??</p>
<p>2- Pressurised- Understood, but Pressurising urself?? Not factual enough because once u have set ur own path there is just construction and not comments on how far u have come.</p>
<p>3- Intelligent people talk less even to their friends and feel good if they talk less, so chill. Its the new psychological study telling this not me.</p>
<p>4- Demisexuals are the most fucked up breed of gaymen. Welcome in the league. Just relax and let it go.</p>
<p>5- Money will make u happy to a great extent but will not enrich ur soul, for that u need human contact and 'pseudo-wisdom' which u will gain when u make ur own destiny.</p>
<p>P.S- Thanks for the wishes and a bow from our sides.</p>
