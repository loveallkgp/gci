hey guys it's H..... M......recently i went to Nepal coz my relatives dwells there.so it's been just few days i'm now back again at my lonely world :(.ok my sweet journey began when i first saw him.his age must be around 21/22(gorgeous face,tanned skin and totally simple outfit)luckily his house was just at my left and it was attached too.once i noticed he used to go and sit in balcony and used to study.so i started visiting balcony to see him and he was studious guy of course and he didn't looked at me even once :p.i know he was busy at studying.so sometimes he used to take break and for god sake once he gave instant look at me and suddenly i pretended like i was watching kids playing just beside him lol.he always used to put headphones in his ear idk why :/?anyway so the time passed by and next day again i went to balcony to see him but he wasn't there i kinda felt sad but soon he came but that day he wasn't studying rather wandering here and there with his headphones on trying some moves of jogging/exercise(i got to know that he loves music)afterward i had one naughty thought in my mind ;).i brought one banana and threw its outer part just below my footsteps and when he reached at my spot i pretended like i don't know anything and just walked but seriously that plan got failed,and i ended up falling down but then he saw me and gave his soft and sweet hands to help me and i tightly hold him and stood back by embracing his shoulder's.(i never looked him in a sexual way).so ok next day he was sitting in balcony(lol balcony thing is kinda repeated but bear with it guys) studying and i went there too and that day he talked to me saying "how r u?"and i replied him likewise we had long conversation and got to know many thing about him.afterwards we became a good friend lol the most sweet thing about him was his accent it always used to kill me.he was able to understand Hindi but not able to speak whenever he tries to speak he used to mix Nepali and Hindi gosh that was damn funny.sooner the saddest moment came when i had to leave.i feel kinda broken when i didn't find him the day when i was returning.i asked where he is then his family replied he went to college and will come back at daytime.that was the most hurting moment i didn't had enough time to say goodbye :'( but what to do there wasn't any solution then i went bare mind with broken heart.and as a result i feel more alone.except him i never looked at anyone still m single but i will try my best again whenever i will go back there.
lastly i love u my.........</p>
