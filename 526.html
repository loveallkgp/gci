<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    hello admin
    i am a final year engineering student. ever since the first year i&#39;ve been in love with my straight best friend. we are best friends since first year and we are always together likes &quot;peas and carrots&quot;. he is the kind of best friend that everyone should have, caring, selfless, understanding and trustworthy.

    my heart melts when he smiles. sometimes i admire his cute face when he is sleeping. when we are sleeping together, sometimes i smell his hairs. i listen to his breaths carefully, but then i stop my self because he is straight and most importantly he is my best friend and i can&#39;t afford loosing him because of my any stupidity.

    once there was a happy movement in between us and out of boldness i kissed his cheek, he pulled himself away immediately but i remember how badly my body shivered and my heart almost jumped out of my chest. i made some excuse and left the room.
    he is not a hugger, so when we were in second year i waited for month for his birthday to come so i could hug him. it was a brief hug but it was worth waiting for.

    in third year i told him that i like him and asked him if he felt same thing for me. he said NO and ever since then i never pressured him in any way.i guess i became mature by then. i still love him but now i don&#39;t want anything from him, i want him to be happy. now i do believe that it is not decent to hit on anyone straight. but i think i can&#39;t hit on anyone now.

    i&#39;ve made many friends now, i am a damn good listener. i do counseling of many friends. when i talk to other students of my age having issues with their family, career and relationships...i think i am not the only troubled person. in fact my problems are nothing as compared to problems to others because although i don&#39;t have a lover in my life, i have a really good best friend with me.

    i have developed hobbies of reading, painting and watching american tv programs. i keep myself occupied. i hang out with friends and i feel happy with them. very often i watch gay porn and masturbate to get free from sexual stresses.

    but every night when i go to bed, i feel enormous pressure on my heart. i feel loneliness, that i can&#39;t discuss with any one not even my best friend who understands me. sometimes i don&#39;t even realize wand my eyes star brimming with tears. i ask my self what is happening with my life....am i happy?? or i am pretending to be happy. i wish i could cuddle my best friend at that time and drift to sleep in his arms, but then i realize...i am alone and he is straight. i hug my pillow and after long hours of depression i fall asleep. (this happens everyday).

    i don&#39;t know why i am posting this or what kind of help i seek, but i just wanted to share.

<h1>Viv- Are you my twin brother? Anyways, your writing really touched the heart. The core of it like valves, the auricles and the ventricles, all of them. The next time when you sleep, try remembering the people you counseled and show the right path to. You will definitely feel happy. Take care buddy. Keep your goodness intact.</h1>
