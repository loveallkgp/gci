<p>GCI I do connect to this world with a fake profile. I do it for my own safety. I know there are people with nasty/ sick mentality lurking in the background to keep track of GAY activities. i DON'T understand why they join the GAY communities when they are themselves not GAYS. Anyways, Admin of GCI you are doing a very good job. You are giving a platform to the whole queer society from all around India. I appreciate you. At the same time I would like to give you a note of caution that don't waste your energy on people who post hate messages. I hope you are intelligent enough to un-cover such people who have homophobic tendencies. Just block these persons and don't led them access to our community. And its not a matter of surprise such people like Mr. Shobit Pandey are also creating nonsense in these valuable online Gay community from a fake profile of himself. Finally I would request to not loose your cool and act intelligently and not emotionally.</p>
<h1>GCI : those people will be complestly blocked .. but again we gotta make fun of them . if we will just block them they will think they were right .if we will answer them , show them mirror and humiliate them on their narrow mindedness .. it will to some extent give them knowledge and they might try to know more about lgbt people. our motive is to bring the knowledge to 'straight and homophobic people or religious people' ... so we gotta reply them . though i understand in what way you said . but see for a change ..  to bring peace ... we must have a hurricane first . .</h1>
