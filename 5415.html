<p>Hey I am 22 guy from Delhi... I am not a sex obsessed person... as I believe 1 should have it with the person whom your comfortable with... Recent I meet a guy whose office is in the same building where I am working... earlier we used to have eye contacts... but just a week ago he asked for lunch together while we chatted for the 1st time in the lift... He is damm really handsome tongue emoticon</p>
<p>Then day after that we went for the lunch to a nearby restaurant and during our chit chats he asked Do you like Men ?_?
And I was silent for a minute... I didnt had any words to say... as I was more over confused with my answer inside my head</p>
<p>Then with all of my strength I said... it depends... as even I am a man too... I like myself... and just laughed on the matter as if I wanted to run away from that stupid question. Then he asked me straight away... I want to fuck som1 like you... I was shokced and replied what the hell you meant? And then after that I went away.</p>
<p>Though I have decided never to talk to that idiotic head ever... but inside even I know i want som1... some guy... whom I can love and visa versa. But I am feed up with guys asking ur T/B/V... WTF... I want love... that doesn't have positions... its pure n mutual!
Seriously I am damm confused now with my life </p>
<h1>GCI- That's not called confusion honey, you know what you want and hopefully you will get what you want.</h1>
