<p>hey..guys.

<p>it may go long but this happened yesterday with me......</p>
<p>yesterday i was was waiting for bus to reach rohini sector 3 and i took bus from mukarba chowk.......
most of the time cute boys u can search over here and u can seemlessly stare at them and it just feel good....
i reached towards conductr to take ticket and most of the time i pick up my bag on shoulders facing front side.....</p>
<p>some guy from behind just forced me intenstionly and tried to touch my butt with his groin.....</p>
<p>the touch which i felt i cant explain....it just make me feel like falling from the sky into the deep ocean where u donot know how and where to stop...</p>
<p>that guy was just behind me touching and fallen over me completely..i for the some seconds just ignored bcz it just happen whe u travel in delhi low floors....</p>
<p>i took ticket and the bus was fully crowded.......in the same postion i moved to search a better location in bus bcz i have to travel for atleast 30 mints.....</p>
<p>that guy was cute and talll....i secretly checked him out and his bulge like hell i cant explain....some times u just dont care for the surrounding and do what u want!!!</p>
<p>his dry hot breath was taking my breathe all the way and when ever driver took break he intensionly forced himself to cover me more and more......</p>
<p>that feeling i am unable to explain and it was so unbearable urge in my blood to kiss him but i didnt. :3 :*.....</p>
<p>then after some time he came just besides me and his chest was touching my shoulders so lovingly.... he covered my chest and back with his both the arms and i felt the warmth in his body yesterday in the RAINNNNY DAY WITH SOME COLD SENSE AROUND.......</p>
<p>i asked him " ye bus pushpanjali enclave jaegi",,,,,
he replied" uska to pata nahi yar"... and then some one called on his phone.....</p>
<p>he was tall handsome and cute so cute by face and small mustaches nd beared on his face and tikka on his forehead seems he is DHARMIK TOOO... &lt;3 :)
then i moved myself to the drivers door bcz i was unable to control my rush in underpants which i was hiding from my bag.....</p>
<p>i really cant understand why it happened with me but for the first time and was great...
he then jan bhuj ke drame karne laga hello hello aur phone kat diya...mere se bola kya aap phone doge apna call cut ho rahi hsi mere mobile se.....
iwaS LIKE WOOWOWOOO...i gave him my mobile he pressed some numbers call talked for 10second and dropped the call.....
i moved and i smiled just he walked behind me till door and i was watching him in driver's mirror and he was searching my body o_O o_O :-P like hell and my side face to kisss......</p>
<p>that guy if u are reading it(means u if having fake gay account) :-<em> i want to say please that time MERI FATTI HUI THI USSE JYADA NAHI BOL SAKTA THA NA HI ME KOI SIGNAL DE SAKTA THA BCZ IT HAPPENED JSST FRST TIME AND what a virgin guy can expect to do more than this.......
