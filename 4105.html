<p>I was shocked to read in times paper that a Infosys gay guy has been arrested under 377 and may spend 10 years in prison. It seems his wife caught him having sex with another guy. I am also getting married next year and must be very cautious. It seems he didnt satisfy his wife sexually whereas i plan to force myself have sex with her atleast once a week. That way she wont suspect anything. I will meet gays for sex only far away from my house. Please all married gays be safe from police.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, the news went like this.</h1>
<p>The guy was effeminate but was forced into the marriage. He and the wife slept in different bedrooms and never had any physical contact. When the wife complained to her in-laws, they said that their son was perfect. Moreover she got to know from the neighbors that their were different men coming in to meet her husband. When she used to come early , the hubby used to come late and vice versa. Frustrated on the whole scene, she put spycams in her hubby's bedroom and then went to her home. On coming back she saw the saved videos of her hubby having sex with other men. </p>
<p>Now in this scenario everyone is a victim and at fault.The guy's family despite of knowing the behavior of their kid decided him to get married. The guy didn't protest. The girl could just have had the talk and had gotten a divorce without going to the police. Moreover, it is against the IT act to use spycams for such purposes. It is a sheer act of breaching someone's privacy.</p>
<p>What you are planning to do is clear cut wrong. I am not acting as a moral police or anything but your decision may feel like totally good and awesome where you can be yourself in your "second" life. It does not work. After a few years you will consider it as a biggest mistake of your life. Better make a correct decision now and don't do a blunder with your life and with a girl's life.</p>
