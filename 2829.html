<p>Well.. I m not gay but i ve met with some gay encounters..
I ve met with a gay encounter last saturday night. I m staying in hostel and got some friends who are staying in a rented house outside. Last saturday i just went to a movie and could not get to hostel on time so i planned to go to my friends room to stay fop that night. No was home that time and they told me the secrete place where they usually keep the key. I just took it and i was waiting for them. Before their arrival another friend came to the room saying that he was also late to the hostel and he just also wanted to stay there that night. From the time he entered he was talking through phone to someone till 11 pm even after all the others had came. I thought he was talking to his gal fren or some gals from his class because he was my roommate in the first year(now we are in our third year of study) and he used to talk to girls of his class for hours.
The rest of my frens and I planned to sleep and we went to bed and still he was talking. It was a tired day for me so i was fast asleep. I m very sensitive so that a small movement or sound near me can wake me up. It was 1.30pm and he came and was lying next to me. I dont said anything as we dont ve place to sleep because two of us were extra for that place.
After that he started seducing me by rubbing his ass against my penis. I was shocked and dont know how to react. I said nothing as it was a heavenly feeling for me too. He then tapped me showing his ass and started fingering... I dont know what to do. To be very frank eventhough i m not gay, was out of my control got his ass in my hands and started rubbing my dick against his ass.
I was in a heavenly feeling enjoying the ass but being a virgin i was afraid to remove my pants and drill my dick into him which i just wanted to do.
It was hard but I somehow managed to control myself as i always wanted to save my virginity till my marriage. And also have a thought that isnt it dirty to have sex with a man being a man.. Am i bi?...the next morning he showed no reaction and i was in a great confusion and till now i m feeling guilty. I then in the just masterbated and left to hostel very early even before my frens had woken up
lots of confusions in my mind.. Apart from every thing he was once my roommate. I couldnt even imagine that i ve seduced him walking around the room with my underwears.
He is my fren and i could not imagine the scene of having sex with him... I ve then tried to know about him. he got a fake girl account on fb. I ve nothing against his sexuality and infact i m okay with it. But though we are from different departments we ought to be in the same hostel for two years from now looking at each others face.. I cant share this with my frens as it is not fair and also its not easy to talk about gay sex with others. Sometimes i get a guilty feeling for i radomly getting some thoughts of having sex with him sometimes later when i get into sex mood... I m totally confused</p>
<h1>GCI- Someone control my laughter! XD XD Sorry man, but you are a bi.</h1>
