<p>Hello #GCI, there was a confession about pain while having anal intercourse.. Eventhough nowadays I don't like to label myself as top/bottom/vers, Actually in Sex, I was top during my initial days, then I'm Vers now still play more a receiver role in anal sex..Here are some tips for the guys who like to receive Poles in their holes 
1. Prepare yourself mentally for the pleasure and don't think about pain.. After all sex is an art to be performed with pleasure 
2. As anus doesn't lubricate on its own, use water based lubricants.. Ask your partner to apply and finger it with lubricant. In case if he doesn't like fingering into your hole, just make it yourself.. 
3. Take slowly and bit by bit.. This is the stage where you exactly feel pain... If the pole just slips in, you feel pain like hell.. So just take it bit by bit until the whole Pop is inside your hole. 
4. Ask your partner to move slow initially and when you start having pleasure, then its upto you to have accelerator during the motion. 
5. Talk to your partner, about being slow and gentle during start. This will make him understand your physical needs during the intake. This will make you feel comfort while receiving the poles..
 Lastly, have a protected sex and don't forget to lube the Pole too.. Cheers in Life..! Good day to All!!</p>
