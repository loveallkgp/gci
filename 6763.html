<p>Hey all, i desperately need ur suggestions, admin and everyone ..,
I m feeling soo terrible about myself., i was (soo sad i m unable to write "is") in love with a guy, he was like the besst man i cud ever be with, extremely handsome, caring he thought of me as his best friend but i fell in love with him, nd wanted him at any cost, i prayed god and in these 4 years i saw no one else, and seee what god did. He defenitely cn not change that guys sexuality but few days back i met a stranger guy in metro and we were talking then i found that we had so many things in common we exchanged number. Nd within few days, he admitted that hez bi, hezzz so in my head, hezzz almost like the one whome i loved, i thought that i wud not love anyone else. But now i m in dilemma, i m feeling like bithch, hezzzz so perfect in everything, hezzzz sooo much like the one whome i love., today he said he loves me nd wnt to have a long term relation, i dont know what to do, one part of my mind says its the gift from god, (how exactly these two people are same, coincidence)
And another part of brain says do be a bitch...,  help me to come over this situation guys, ..., i m sooo wanna hit my head hard......</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, stop setting up a standard for your likeliness. You don't have to like a person because he is like the person that you previously liked. Everyone is an individual. Secondly, go for a person if and only if he likes you in turn. Having feelings for a straight guy will lead you nowhere(I guess I have said this atleast a 1000th time). Try and take it slow with the guy you met in metro.</h1>
