<p>Hi admin seems like you are doing some real good work over here. Hats off!
Anyways I never thought I would be doing this but here I am. I have been over here for long now- it's been close to two years or perhaps even more. I have kept my involvement among people a bit limited over here because most guys are sex seekers. But I never stop trying and add new guys and chat with them. This way I have found a handful of good friends at least. It so happened last week that I started talking to a guy over here and I sort of liked him. I felt a bonding with him in the first conversation itself. We talked another day and the world seemed all the lot more beautiful.
But it was short lived. The very next day when we started chatting he said that he is leaving facebook. He has had two break ups in last one year and some friends ditched him. Perhaps he knew that I was liking him and did not want to go ahead. I asked him to stop but he didn't and said he will come back some day.This guy has left me confused. I still do not know what exactly was up in his mind. And above all is he worth waiting for?</p>
<h1>AdminViv- IF he comes back and texts you, that means he felt the same way about you. Then its worth hanging on to him. Don't pamper yourself in the meantime. :)</h1>
