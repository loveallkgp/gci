<p>Why are bottom men usually portrayed as hairless beings? Is hairless that sexy compared to hairy men. It conditions everyone to be turned on by smooth guys more than hairy ones
I like smooth, toned guys (I can't stand overly buffed up men) too. They are fucking hot.
But I would rather get fucked by a chimpanzee/orangutan/gorilla/monkey/ape with fucking awesome personality than a hairless, shaved-vagina-like guys who have something stuck up their ass up till their brains.</p>
<p>Fuck you physically beaus who are burnt messes. Your face will become like a granny's wrinkly vagina and equally unattractive as you grow old.</p>
<p>Fuck you uggos who are actually fucking awesome as persons and think they aren't worth anything. Your inner beauty outshines everything and your partner is the luckiest man on earth. So raise you head high. But please, know that extra mark for good handwriting, too ;)</p>
<p>Love you bitches.</p>
<p>Oh btw, GCI, I sent a peck on your cheek flying and a slap on your booties :P And of course, loads of love :* &lt;3</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh i likes a hairy man. And bae, no one touches my booty. The touch is specifically for the one. :)</h1>
