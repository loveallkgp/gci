<p>"I just love the feel of stockings/pantyhose.. I would wear them at times, even once to the hellfire club , where I was not so much caught but confessed to a close female friend... ""oohhh you kinky devil was the reply""... Then a few years later I started wearing an exes (not at the time) snug tight dresses, and it felt great!! Why is it that men clothing is texturally plain and boring, and women have 1001 textures to tingle the senses.. silk, satin, lace, nylons, gause, etc... </p>
<p>I was almost sprung once when my partner was out with the girls, I was enjoying a dress up session, and she'd forgotten something, I hear a key in the door, and quickly throw a blanket over me... It wasn't my gf but a friend of ours who walked in to get the 'thing'...
Story is the 'friend' caught me masturbating.. ironically knowing her she would have been more acctepting of the truth...
In a way it was kinda thriling...</p>
<p>Now my gf has been in hospital for the last month, and I have bought some wicked skirts, shoes and items to wear I know the sensuality of wearing these things means I will keep it up, but how to tell someone you love so much that it doesn't change things between us?! (she know i've 'dabbled' in the past but doesnt like it)</p>
<h1>gci- So you are in the lesbian relationship already?</h1>
<p>She wears jeans, tshirts and cardies... One of us has to have a feminine wardrobe damn it!!!
Why can she crossdress and I can't..lol"</p>
