<p>Hey ppl, I am a 22 years old guy from Chennai, doing masters in engineering.</p>
<p>Some says people are born gay and some says people are turned in to gay due to some circumstances. But in my case I liked boys as far as I can remember. For instance, I had a very hugeee crush on a boy when I was in 3rd standard! Could you believe that?! I was always gay.</p>
<p>But I never wanted people to even guess that I could be gay. I always try too hard to act tough and straight.</p>
<p>I got myself into lot of sports, I am going to gym for past 5 years, grew passion for bikes and cars, I talk with my friends a looot about girls, boobs, pussy and asses.</p>
<p>I am really a two faced bastard..</p>
<p>I like soft nature and innocent guys, But I make fun of them and be mean to them in public.
I like romantic movies and melodies. But I watch only action movies and item songs when I am around people.
I really loved a guy from my college, I felt so insecure about it.. so just to hide my feelings for him.. I picked up a fight with him and punched him.. and now he consider me as his mortal enemy.</p>
<p>My planetromeo profile says "Only for sex, no friendship, no love and blah blah blah... I F**k and Forget". But I really want to fall madly in love with a boy and have a serious relationship. But I am too egoistic to accept that to another person.</p>
<p>I always want to look like a tough and hard guy. I never want anyone to find my soft side. Am I sick? Whats wrong with me?</p>
<h1>GCI- No honey, you are just too much full of your macho ego. In addition to that you are scared of your true identity. What if someone knows etc etc and blabbity bleh. You are a typical case of those guys who are scared from within but hurt others to make yourself feel better because you cannot see the guts of other like you. This is the truth about you.</h1>
<p>You have to shed your ego. Being whatever you are, doesn't makes you above others and being yourself will not make you beneath anyone. You are living for a lie and for its temporary acceptance. Just to be a part of the so-called normal club. It's time you come out of it and live for what you want. Stand in front of the mirror and say all the stuff that you just wrote. I am sure your burden will lift and you will feel happy. And after a few months when you have completely embraced yourself, come here and we will share a laugh on your stupid past-self. :)</p>
