<p>Hey ! 
Im 20 years old. Im like you guys. I was ashamed of my sexuality in my childhood as I used to think that no one will be proud of the way I am. My childhood was worst. I used to sit quite all day unlike other kids because my cousin abused me and warned me not to tell it to anyone. I started to stammer because of depression. I grew up like that. A year ago, I came to metro city for my further studies and I found a guy on social networking site and we got connected. We were so mad for each other.  We fell in love . It is a distance relationship.He came to my city to meet me and made me feel so special. I recently went to his city to meet him after 8 months. Everything was going so well. I felt so blessed. We have planned our lives together. And THEN.... 
Actually my dad was following a pandit since 2 months . I actually dont believe any pandit but when my dad met him, that pandit literally told him everything about me like every single thing that has happened in my life from my childhood to my college life and said that my career will lie nowhere, I ll do nothing in my life . He said to father " you ll die in 2021 of shame just because of your son's confession and your wife (my mom) will go insane."
I know myself better than anyone else. And I know what he said abt my past is 100% correct. I dun wanna loose my love and my parents both. I dont know what to do. My dad is so depressed. At this situation I dont know how to tell him that im different. </p>
<p>P.s bad comments about pandit not gonna help as he has said alot true things about my life in detail so I cant prove him wrong. </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, as you know what the outcome is gonna be, better try to change it by teaching your parents. It will be a long process but do not loose hope. They might be angry in the beginning but they will come around when they will see that you are happy.</h1>
