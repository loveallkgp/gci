<p>its me any my darling ... I fell for him d first tym I saw him... but I knew he was str8.. so didn't dare let him knw my feelings... I offered him my frndship n soon we were buddies ... but after a year I had a fight with him n we didn't talk for four months after four months we were so impatient for each other dat when we meet we became passionate and physical... its was all so sudden ... we loved each other very much and lived with each other for 7 months but our career streams and colgs separated us... nw we live in two opposite ends of india... we seldom talk... but I still love him and mayb he does as well...</p>
