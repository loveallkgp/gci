share him wid any1 ....so i sd u hv to choose
between me nd d girl.....he answrd...dat ur
worth is nthng in my life u r nly gd till
bed......i'll stay more happy wid
gal....goodbye......getlost
2. Another reason...is i hv no value of feelngs
nd emotions in society. Nobody respect me. I
live in dis world putting a big fat mask
coverng all my sorrows.
3. Thirdly aftr breakng wid my ex....no doubt i
ws shattred all ovr....bt as tym past ....i saw
dat so many guys nd gals were behind me....i
thgt datng odr ppl wld give me new life...new
courage...new dreams....but alas i went into
3-4 relationshps....nd all of them were more
advanced versions of my ex....who nt nly
made disturbd me sexually bt also disturbd
me financially nd mentally
I thgt dat each nd evry creature in dis world
os born diffrnt nd went into trstng each nd
evry guy....bt i ws wrng dese all wr nly
intrstd in sex.....
I always ask myself dat m i ugly frm inside
dat dese guys nly like my face nd body ....nd
nt accept my innerself....
4. I cannot share my happiness nd sorrows to
nt evn to d person who is vry close to
me.....in d fear dat i wld loose...
5. By takng all dis into my mind.....i hv lost
faith in my ownself.....in love....
Aftr breakng wid my love...i thgt i wld gt into
love again....bt i nvr gt to see love
again......nw i fear dat my heart wld bcme so
stubborn dat it wld nt love any1 evn if d ri8
ppl cme into my life
6. I nvr expectd a single gift or a thing frm
any1 ....i just expctd lots nd lots nd lots of
love nd carng....whch dey nvr gave me
7. Last april i startd datng my love....my bday
also lies in april.....i gt goose bumps......nd gt
scared of dose memories like hell....i thgt dat
i wld frgt him......bt no he still dere somewhr
in me ...nd will nt gt out till my last breath....
7. I hv to nt nly fight to myself to standup in
dis world bt also to fight wid dis society
provng wrng thing dat m str8...
8. Also d SC judgement.... it makes me feel
dat my death is very close to me
I m nt postng dis to show off....bt to make
my ownself feel light.....i cnt share dese
things wid any1 ...... no hopes....no
dreams.....nd no love......nd no feelngs.....to
live dis life......just livng for my family.....coz
dey love me more dan their ownlife......</p>
<p>$ABBY : darling you ain't the only one going through the rough phase in life . half of the problems you told are not even problems but universal truth .. as we grow up we are meant to face them .  focus on your career instead . .. </p>
<p>you aren't the only gay here ... we all are , and we facing the same .you are man now not kid . understand there is big difference between a suffering and a ' just problem ' . there are people out there getting raped and then physically tortured , being expelled out of job coz they have aids , being mocked coz they have dark complexion . just be thankful to god for how beautiful life is and that he has given you family . </p>
<p>and think of that mothers heart which difinitely shattered after seeing her son crying .. never make your parents worry about u... they are getting old and learn to be responsible instead of blaming others for your sorrows.</p>
