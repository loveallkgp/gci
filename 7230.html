<p>I'm in my late 19 &amp; fed up of living such a dual life. I am a boy, who gets attracted towards other guys but that doesn't mean I'm slut or abnormal. Here, hardly anyone believes in relationship and for society, love between same sex is not acceptable. I have tried a lot to fit within society &amp; abolish gay feelings but i failed. ;( I have never let anybody knows about my sexuality but my fear about my future is destroying me from inside ;( Sometimes I even get nightmares and now I'm suffering from sleep disorder. So, my question is if homosexuality is curse or against the nature then why God has made me such a way ? ......and also give suggestions, how can I overcome this ?</p>
<h1>GCI- Sweety, u want to turn more sick than the already sick society of ours which is nothing but the gobshite dung of the last 1000 years of mixed colonial and cultural shit??</h1>
<p>For ur sleep disorder go to a doc and STOP overthinking about ur sexuality for heavens sake and stop holding the victim card will ya!</p>
<p>U CANNOT shoo away the gay part of urs and remember that things are getting better, albeit at a slow pace but u need to get out of that homophobic place, acquire ur intelligence and strength  at a supportive place and then be the voice of the many by channeling ur soul as the power plug.</p>
<p>Homosexuality was NEVER  a curse and thanks to the Roman pseudo saint Aquinas' shit and Roman emperor Constantinus that the latter era Victorians( christians unfortunately) made a law here in 1860s against homosexuality.</p>
<p>Now tell me, would u still want to change to a crow when u r born a cuckoo?</p>
