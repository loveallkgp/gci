<p>My life is full of comedy, ironies or errors. u can call it anything.</p>
<p>I accepted tht i was a bisexual when i was about to graduate nd was 21 years old.Now, at this age every needs a partner, I didnt had a real girlfriend, only some "timepass"... nd i wasnt happy with tht coz i wanted love....though i was still a virgin.
After accepting tht i am a bi, i started to look for boys....but where? I tried my luck on omegle...just out of curiosity, and to my surprise i found one good boy, cute, innocent, smart, intelligent etc, nd botm (i think i m top) nd he was still a virgin (( i trust him)...but the problem was tht he was from Kolkata nd i m from pune.....so far away. we are still talking with each other on skype....
But thn we have some urges, So i turned towards facebook....there I found another good person , just like the kolkata guy.who was from the same city as i was.</p>
<p>I dated both of them, talked to the kolkata guy on phone, skype etc, and the other too in real.
This is going for about 3 months, i have feeling for both of them....now, the twist :</p>
<p>I m leaving my home city....nd going to Delhi for studies.....
Mene dusre bande ko islie prpose kia tha coz i dont wanna be in long distance relationship...i wanna be with dem...but ye biggest joke in my life...ki jisko bhi like kro wo ab dur rehta hai...ya dur rahega.
:(</p>
<p>Plz suggest me, wht should I do? should i start anew? start from scratch? I dont know wht to do now....plz suggest something taki koi hurt na hi...i dont want to make anyone sad.</p>
<h1>GCI : its like you want physical pleasure from relationship thats why asking for the same city ( as if somebody finds a person of their liking they will in no condition ..never ever ever leave them ) .</h1>
<p>but seems like you have already made mind to start a new affair in delhi . so i suggest you should confess and break up with both the other guys . tell them the right reason that you can't be in long distance relationship . </p>
<p>i know long distances don't work and in gay world its even more hard .</p>
