I am in love wid this guy from almost an year..may be more,, i dont even knw when i fell for him.. he knows about it.. but according to him its not possible... we r still frns.. talk over whatsapp once in a couple of days... i have tried evrythng to forget him.. even tried to get along with other guys and tried to get physical also wid the guys who like me.. but i just cant connect wid nyone and there always a thot of him at the back of my mind and so i hav lost all sexual desires for any other guy for that matter... now am just going crazy... i dream about him, his face flashes infront of my eyes,,, i have even tried moving to a different country to distract myself but cudnt survive for more than 6months. everytime i see his fb profile my heart just start falling weak again..all the determintaton to forget him just fades away.. any suggestions,,what shud i do.. am just dying every second with the thought that he dsnt love me.. it sounds really stupid.. it sounds all filmy.. nut its true... now we both live in diffnt city...1000kms aways almost but when another country cudnt do nythng what good can another city do.. any suggestions .. i really like the humorous answers u give... and i have no idea how to post confessions so thot to drop in the msg box.</p>
<h1>GCI- It happens when you truly love someone. To get your had back on the track, you can simply cancel off all the contacts and remove him from your fb. See, its about your mental health and future. Right now thinking on him seems like a thing of love but look at future too. You will be frustrated, and then a time will come when you will be alone and you will curse yourself for not taking a step to divert your mind forcefully. One way or the other you can try to get involved more in other people. If love is what you need, love is should you get.</h1>
