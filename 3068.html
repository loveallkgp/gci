<p>I m kind of found out that I m gay now. I m the new boy here. I braced myself for the problems I gonna face. I prepared myself for the worst.But, before that I wanted to suicide for the feeling I was having for boys. I didnt want to live. I didnt want to be freak. But how long can u be frustrated with yourself ? so, I accepted myself.
The thought of death scared me... I wanted to live. I want to enjoy. I want to be human. This is a great group, I see many people like me hear. You people are source of my inspiration here. You people live a happy life. I want a happy life too.
But after reading the confession from #3059 I feel bad. Are we cursed to a life like this? I didnt tell my parents yet, but it is no mystery they wont accept me. Why cant I be myself...? Why is there no bloody choice..? I want to be myself and accepted for who I m... I study well... I m a graduate with good skills... I m every bit a son a proud father can have... But me being gay will disappoint him... I want to be happy... I want a boyfriend who will walk with me holding my hand... who will take me to romantic dates... who will get up next to me every morning...
I feel wasted... I feel that all this pain I m going through will be for nothing... Is there a simpler solution..? My friends are happy with their life... then, there is the inevitable - Marriage- the very thought of it scares the shit outta me...I will plainly deny it as long as I can... I cant even dream of spoiling another girl's life. I didnt hurt anybody why I have to have such a life...? I dont want to die... I dont know wat true love is still.... I want to be kissed... To be loved... To be held with caring arms... Why m I denied that? Life is Fu*king unfair. I dont deserve this... If ever I change my mind to suicide I will ask God this... He cant complain that I didnt try to live... I trying my level best... with every ounce of will left in me... I m expecting, praying for a better life that is yet to come... Is this too much to ask ? </p>
<h1>GCI- DO NOT even think of suicide. You have to live your life the way YOU want! And please, don't think that love, family, pride, marriage etc are the things for heterosexual lifestyle only. You can also fall in love and you will. You also can have a family. You also can get married. You can live with pride. Life is not unfair. If you keep your actions clean and true then Karma will pay you back in positive reactions. Be proud and be happy and don't let those fake confessions take down your confidence. You have a life so make it worth living. Keep the agony aside and make way for beautiful things!</h1>
