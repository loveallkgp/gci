<h1>Ash 19,</h1>
<p>"Male child sexual abuse"
Sometimes it definitely leaves a stamina behind.
It is super attack on self confidence and create confusion at little ages about its happening.</p>
<p>I have seen many people confessing that they are gay because once the faced child abuse.
I can't say over this matter properly but my case is bit different.
I was 8 when that happened with me, but I think I knew my sexuality even before that scene.
My inclination was towards same sex. Whenever I saw a handsome guy I wished to be friend with him, my homosexuality was like this at early stage.</p>
<p>I meant my abuse is not responsible for my sexual orientation, its something else. And perhaps possible with others as well. </p>
<h1>GCI- You know this is the general theory put forward by ignorant people that if a guy is gay then he must have been abused by someone in his childhood. What they fail to understand is that it can be a case for some people but many are born that way.</h1>
