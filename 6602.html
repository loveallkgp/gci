<p>hello everyone, this is my first confession on this page , hope you don't troll me.
so it's about a guy whom I love .he came in my life 2 years ago.he had such an amazing personality that I fell in love with him at first sight.i started to talk to him gradually.i dont whether he was gay or not but I remember one day he told me that he loves me.i was overjoyed and felt like I was on cloud 9.i also shared my feelings with him.everything was going smooth but suddenly he started to keep a distance with me .I asked him many times what has happened but he never told the reason.i did not talk to him for 1 year after that.
next year I started to talk with him again.this year we had to face board exams so we used to meet alot.after the exams were over he did that again.one day i got to hear from one of my friend that he says that he is bored with me and also said so much rubbish about me.i was hurt.i went to him and asked about that but he did not say a word.i could feel affection in his eyes for me but don't know why he is behaving like that.now I have changed my school because of personal reasons.but I miss him so much . can't get my mind away from his memories.unknowingly it is harming my studies.i belong from a middle class family.i know I have to take care of my family in next 2 or 3 years.
if you guys have any suggestion then tell me.</p>
<p>PS-admin I am expecting a damn funny reply from you . hope you won't disappoint me.</p>
<h1>GCI- Consider yourself disappointed on the humour part. I am not in the mood.</h1>
<p>For the rest, if you know what to work for and how to work for it, just do it. Move on from that guy. You may have loved him but you cannot just rely on the memories for ever. If you continue like that, you will be your own destruction. I am not joking.</p>
