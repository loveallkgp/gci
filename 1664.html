<p>I've done something i shouldn't have. I don't know why im becoming a monster. Before i found love i was always upset and when i found an angel i torcher him. I've have been drinking lately and our relationship is very young; only a month old. Before my relationship i didn't drink or neither attacked anyone but its increasing everyday. Yesterday i was so drunk and went to him home late night and when he start to talk to me about this behaviour i slapped him really hard and as far as i remember his lips started bleeding. He pushed me out from house and asked me to leave him forever.
This morning i went to visit him but his maid said that he left early morning to somewhere and dint even mention. Now im really worried. Im sorry i hurt you. You blocked my number everywhere and i cant even apologize to you about my wrong doing. Im writing this so that you can see this because I know you are an ardent reader of this page and you will see this message. Please talk to me once. I am sorry please forgive me. I am willing to compromise all my stupid friend whom you despise; i love you just text me.
I am sorry!</p>

<h1>Viv- Darling, if you can't handle the alcohol why do you have to take it? There's a saying that goes like, "If you give a fire log in the hand of a monkey then the whole jungle is gonna get burnt." Go to the rehab center and get cured of this drinking habit. And for your guy, hear the confessor out once. Just once, it won't hurt.</h1>
