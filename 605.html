<p>hey admin!!
i was in a long dist rel fr 8 months with ma bf.we have meet 3 tyms.all was going well bet us but due to my stupidness or u can say insecurity i tried to hack his account as i felt he is slow in replying n even sometym he didnt replied.he was angry with my foolishness.this was the first crack in our rel.from tht day we started doubting each other n i did many stupid things such as chatting with him frm a fake id n lots of other stuffs.i was also a conservative kind of person who was afraid of meeting him publicly n oneday i told him tht our rel dosenot hv any future n we broke up.but didnt wanted him to loose so i said we will be remain as friend only but he refused n left.after tht i tried 2 reach him through phone but he didnt replied.after 2 months whn i texted him on whtsapp he was nice but whn i asked fr friendship he didnt replied which made me annoyed n i texted some stupid stuffs to which he got angry n started abusing me n said he dont wanna talk with me any more n nt 2 disturb him further.frm tht day i didnt also hv contacted him.
my prob is m nt able to erase his memories frm my mind.he was vry good to me.he was lovable n caring too.we hv spent vry precious tym together.i sometime even vist the places whr we used to meet.even i stalk at his fb profile.
till tdy i m unable to forget him.
plz plz tell me some ways hw i can erase all his memories??</p>
