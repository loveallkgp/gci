<p>I view this confession page everyday and read all new confessions and after reading them, all i do is take a long breath and let my mind get blank for few minutes( just for few minutes!!, it has to again observe many things and induldge in daily evolutionary practices of my character). I feel sad for so many gays, most of them are suffering from so many problems and i find this depressing. Then i think, "will this happen to me too someday?" "Should i find a partner for me?". I wonder that i too may find a partner and soon i will find him as a cheater, sex seeker or he is in love with someone else or he can't continue his relationship with me.  Why this happens to all of us? Why we gays have to suffer so much? Why finding true love is so difficult in gay world?</p>
