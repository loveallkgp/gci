<p>how do i start. my family was going through a bad phase where my parents we about to leave each other. i had a girlfriend she loved me very much, but due problem in my family i could not do the same for her and we broke up. i was devastated i almost gave up on my life. my parents were about to seperate which made me mad and on top of that i was so lonely. so i disconnected myself from the world in a way, i started harming myself like cutting my wrist and so on. i started drinking and hanging out with random people in bars and clubs.
At that point i met a boy in club where i was so high, he took me his home but didn't do anything and spent the night there. we became friends; very close friends. he always picked me up from home to college and so on. but lately i dont know he is acting strange giving me hints that he loves me but im ignoring it. im very confused; yes i do like his company but should i go in a relationship where my parents are about to break? thats the question that always strikes my head whenever i see him; i never knew i would fall for a man, but he has changed me like from inside too outside, he took care of me like his baby when i messed up anything and behaves very politely when i became voilent. what should i do? should i call him up and say that i love him very much? but seeing my parents fight everyday makes me question will our love story last? or is it just a phase in my life?
and i also wish that no child has through as much as I did. </p>
<h1>Viv- The question should be, do you really love him? Also, are you really gay? I think you are feeling affection towards him just because he is being a support system to you in the times of trouble. If you really are gay, you can be with him. But if you are straight then please don't lead him on. And every love story is different. Seeing a bad one doesn't mean yours will follow the same course. Think practically in this situation. Have a good life ahead.</h1>
