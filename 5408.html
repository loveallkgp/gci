<p>Well...I'm not from India,but culture, language,norms and stigma of the society is pretty much similar of ours and India.So Im going to confess something,and hope to get some good answer. I'm Nepali, and I come from high middle class family, where my family have reputation in society(Name) and most of them belong to Army,Police and Business as a profession.I recently turned 27 y/o and I'm getting pressure from my family and every person that lives in our neighborhood to get married and settle down. But people don't understand that I don't belong to league they assume me to be in. Every single day or least a month I'm given the name of different girls and their picture to select from and I simply ignore them. But the pressure, silence, pain, suffering is becoming unbearable day by day. I can't be true to myself,because I'm "Pretending" to be some one else that I'm not and even if I want to be, will this society be cool with that? this question hunts me every single night in my bed where silence is profound. When I wake up next morning, I have to come with some solid answer about the same ritual question "WHEN ARE YOU GETTING MARRIED" from Tom,Dick and Harry. I can't think of anything...whenever I try to think I go blank...seems like my brain has been frozen........ Just because of my happiness I don't want loose my childhood friends, "I" don't want to be the reason that will make my family ashamed of. I don't want people to point a finger at my family because of me....Apparently being "GAY" is SIN. Society is HOMOPHOBIC and my straight friends, sister's families, town and neighbors are among those 'SOCIETY" SO WHAT SHOULD I DO...I'm too coward to accept for who Im and I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO....and I don't wanna marry a girl knowing that I will ruin her life. Please share your experience, thought or any good advice you guys have for me,it will be highly appreciable.</p>
<h1>GCI- You are form Nepal and I guess It is the gay friendliest country of south east Asia. Maybe you can take the help of any NGO to counsel your parents and close family who are really concerned with you?</h1>
<p>In any other case, you just have to come out I guess. I you are financially independent, just make decisions for yourself that are good FOR YOU. Not for anybody else, but you. You don't have to please everyone around you as they are not making your life easy anyway. Stop living gin the shadows of something that you are not. You don't have to pretend. I never pretended when I was in my hometown even though my family, my neighbors, my friends were all way too much conservatives. Stay true to yourself and make a right decision. God bless you.</p>
