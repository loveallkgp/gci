<p>I came out to my parents when I was 15 yrs old... </p>
<p>and they love me.</p>
<p>now I am 28..</p>
<p>had many love affairs since long...</p>
<p>BUt today, I stand totally alone...</p>
<p>I do my work diligently...</p>
<p>I have stopped seeking love and support...</p>
<p>it's a strange phase...</p>
<p>can anyone empathise...</p>
<p>I have, as it were, outgrown the need of constantly seeking love outside..</p>
<p>rather, I just have made my work and my hobbies as my center...</p>
<p>I consciously avoid socialising..</p>
<p>what du u thing..du tell me...</p>
<p>Thanks in advance....</p>
<h1>GCI- Many people do build a guard around them in which they feel comfortable. I had that too. The things that were new to you, become boring and a part of the routine. That's when you lose a part of yourself and start drifting away from the population around you.</h1>
<p>People connect well with vulnerability, the sense of being wanted and the sense of belonging. Sadly, today vulnerability is considered weak and too dramatic. </p>
<p>Maybe try showing some emotions to those you care about. You will see that life is much more than just from 9 to 5.</p>
