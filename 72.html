<p>part 1:
lets start.
i was born as the eldest son to a beautiful pair of parents in 1992 in kerala into a huge family of quite a few uncles and aunts.
but soon we moved to the middle east when i was 4 years old. we were never so well to do, but everything at least seemed happy.
dad was a sweet and gentle person (back then) but mom was all the more strict and disciplinary.
we lived in an apartment when i reached the middle east. it was a whole new world. missing my granny and cousins was overcome by the fact that i could finally live with my parents.
they were both working, which made me alone at home sometimes. but that did not bother me much maybe cos i did not know the difference of being in company.
i too became busy and unavailable when i rejoined school. it was all fun and are nostalgic memories now.
i was a regular kid with a regular life. but it all changed soon.
we moved in to a new apartment, where we shared it with a man who was older than my dad. he was a fine gentle man when he was sober.
every afternoon the schedule would be that dad and mom, if not working would take a nap while i study in the living room. when i was 7 years old, one such afternoon my parents were sleeping and i was doing my home work, our flat mate came up to the living room and sat next to me.
he came closer and asked me to sit on his lap, i did not think twice before being obedient. and i got busy with my work, i did not notice him doing anything until he unzipped my shorts. i was confused and i asked him what was he upto. all he said was to cam down, and he continued to stroke my tiny dick. this was the first time the seeds of sex was put into my mind. i don't know about everyone, but i feel 7 years is a bit too early for a kid to know about sex.
it would have been better if he had stopped there. but he wanted more. he took out his dick and asked me to stroke it too. he did not force me, i did it willingly. and there i was stroking the penis of a man quite older than my dad.
this was my first sexual experience. i would not call it as molesting me, cos i gave in to him without any reluctance. i was brought into the world of sex by a man who is almost 30-40 years older than me. initially i did blame him and hate him for doing this to me, but later on i started to feel that he helped me discover myself.</p>
<h1>AdminViv-  i think thats precisely the form of molesting. But you're cool with so, ehhh.. whatever -_-</h1>
