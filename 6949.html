<p>I have some doubts or confusion regarding my relationship life and sex life.
I am 19 years old guy. I am in 2nd year of my engineering. After first semester, one of my senior guy proposed me. He simply says, he wanna marry me. He is also from my hometown too. After long consideration of 3 months, I accepted his proposal, so we are in a relationship now. We both are in love with each other. He cares for me, loves me. I feel like a girl sometimes (its quite awkward) because he treats me like that viz he never let me spend a buck when we are together, and gifts me on regular basis though he is from good wealthy background. But he is very aggressive, very very very much possessive. He can not see me talking to some other girl or guy. Even he had also cut his friend-circle with to an extent. Even he did quit talking to most of girls including his ex girlfriends. He just wants me all the time. This all scares me a lot. He wants to talk all the time, meet all the time, this is though cute but sometimes i feel like just being suffocated. I feel scared like he was into girls and all of a sudden this all happened ! He is very handsome guy, so can get any guy or girl anytime, but he is with me, so i don't sense-he is using me, he is just in love. But he is really crazy, and i am quite shy and reserved one. He kisses me in front of our friends, though because he is quite manly, no one senses the reality, all takes it as a fun. We were been to Goa this December and he smooched me on the beach for about 3-4 minutes, I felt awkward but he was pretty normal and happy. His love, smile and his happiness makes me to feel so good that's why i never denies him for anything. But i feel really confused means i feel too tough to take care of such a crazy guy.
2ndly, he is aggressive and really aggressive in bed that's too hard for me. It is also because of his big big size around 8 or 9 inches. I am bottoming for him for about one year still i feel too pain to take him in. How to cope up with this?
We both are tested for STDs. And he is active in bed means regular in sex but he never forces me , but on regular basis we do get intimated either in oral or anal sex. He always remains up for sex, so in a week, at least for 3-4 days, we do anal sex. I give him blowjob most of the time, he cums in my mouth few times, though i don't mind and i love it doing for him and he enjoys it more than anal but Is it good to do oral too much, to give too much blowjob for me and taking his cum inside? And is it ok for me to be this much active in anal sex?
Please do give some good suggestions on serious note.
Thanks</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, you are dating an overly sexual psychopath guy. Cutting down relations with friends, controlling, unacceptable social behavior(I am not counting PDA in this) and dominant behavior, all points to his psychopathic nature. You may feel good with it because you accept all of these things that you are comfortable with, then there is nothing to say. But even if you gotta say something to him, I'd say do it carefully. You won't know what he would do in aggression. Work, according to your own instincts. If anything, calm him down, say lovely words and then say that you are concerned about his nature, and that it is bothering you to carry on.</h1>
<p>As for sexual roles, ask him once that you want to reverse the roles and be dominant in sex. Reply back with what he says.</p>
