<p>"I don't what should I do. Where should I take him. Recently my boyfriend lost his mother in heart attack few months back he was pretty broken. He had his only sister who studied abroad. Few weeks ago she committed suicide because she could not take any more pressure. They lost there parents at a very early age. My boyfriend's family are sort of giving him mental support. He is from northeast and he stays all alone in Delhi. I could not control myself and brought him home with me. I work and he studies in university. Recently he is being very moody and always cries sometimes when I'm office he calls me up and starts crying. I even took leave from my office for few weeks and took him for counselling; the counsellor asked me to take him far from city I've done that took him to Manali for trip. He was sort of alright but now he does things like harming himself with knife I love him alot. I always pamper him. I rush from office whenever he ask me. Sometimes he just wants to go for long drive I take him. But now I'm really concerned I'm not able to give him that much of time due to office meetings and all and when I reach home he still be lying in sofa or bed harming himself blood dripping from his hands. I just don't know what to do. I can't leave him he is like a baby. I love him a lot tell me what should I do. I really need a good advice now :'(</p>

<h1>gci- You are being an awesome partner to him and. Carry it on and take him to a therapist. In some part of his brain he is still depressed and he will be out of it slowly and slowly because he's been through a lot. Do not leave him and be with him everytime. You truly are a gem.</h1>
