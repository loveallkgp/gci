<p>my best friend is also a gay man, we were quite happy with each other and discussed everything,
but from last one year, he wants to live a straight life, and he blamed me for his being gay,</p>
<p>kabhi kehta ha k aaj ke baad mujhse kabhi gay baate mat karna, maine kaha ok, nhi karunga, agar tujhe problem ha to,
fir khud hi mahine do mahine me gay sex ki baate shuru kar deta ha, ki sex ki ichha ha, kisi se milwa de, it happens three time,
but I did not mind anything</p>
<p>last month achanak wo mujhe ulta seedha bolne laga, tu cheap gay hai, sex seeker hai etc etc, jabki koi issue bhi nhi tha kisi bhi tereh ka</p>
<p>maine us se kaha ab mujhse baat tab karna jab tujhe apne shabdo par afsos ho,</p>
<p>wo bola k tu cheap gay ha aur gays cheap hi hote ha, mujhe kabhi afsos nhi hoga,</p>
<p>15 din baad uska sms aaya, k I m sorry for all that, hum baat kar skte ha agar tu mujhse gay baate nhi kare to,</p>
<p>maine bhi reply de diyaa, mujhe tera with conditions maafinaama manjur nhi, ma baat karunga to har tereh ki baat warna koi nhi, if u agree than ok otherwise dont disturb me again.,
he said, as u wish, and we break</p>
<p>kya maine theek kiya, I need him badly in my life, hamaare sex relations nhi the kabhi bhi, but emotional level par we are strongly attached, </p>
<h1>GCI- Oh honey, his periods are troubling him. He clearly should stop hating himself and come out of denial. He is forcing himself to be something that he is not and he is taking out his frustration out on you. Human nature is just like that that they want to blame others for their own actions. If you want you can ask him about his insecurities that he is having which will lead you to discuss about the way he is behaving. And if you don't want any drama then you can live in peace and let him deal with his periods alone.</h1>
