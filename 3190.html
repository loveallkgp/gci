<p>Hey admin! Greetings. I have a name-sake friend. Wonder what it is between us. We have been friends for years. Had tiffs, broke off, three year silence, and yet we are back together again. I almost left him for good. He chased me like I was his love of life. Now, he is married. And has two kids. The thing between us is we spend nights together, monthly or bi-monthly. I usually massage all his body. Its sexual for me. He considers himself straight, but he lets me do whatever. It is not even under a pretense of sleep but wide awake.</p>
<p>It was innocent love for him in at beginning. Later, my lust took over, and I badly wanted him for sex. I thought of giving him sleeping pills and then seducing him in sleep. I didn't do that. After long break up, since we are together, we spend nights again. He is now consciously letting me suck him. We both casually even talk during all this. I love him deeply; yes, gay-wala love. But yes, I am aware he is married and can't be mine. So, just letting it flow.</p>
<p>My question is this: Last night, we were together. I sucked him deep and wild. He loved it. This time, I swallowed his sperm. I wanted to. That strange desire and want to take all of him into me. I am not worried but a little apprehensive about it. Anything to be worried of or to be careful about? Need some info on swallowing sperms.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help. Bless ur heart! You're special. :)</p>
<h1>GCI- You might as well be licking the lady parts of his wife virtually. Ewww... Swallowing of sperms is not bad unless you are sure that the other person is not having multiple sex partners. In his case he has a wife. Now if he is sleeping around with others as well, just don't put a raw dick in your mouth for your own sake. Also if you are sleeping around with others and that too without protection, you can do him with protection.</h1>
<p>PS- Don't just limit gay love to having sex. You can have sex with anyone in this whole wide freaking world. Get love from someone for whom you will be the first person and not just some dry humping side kick.</p>
