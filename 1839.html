<p>Its been more than 2 weeks that we broke up. Though none of us declared it. The thing is I still had his num coz my heart believes may be he could come back. So last day don't know why I checked his whatsapp, he wrote on his status 'Don't msg below 18'! Does this signifies he is a sex seeker? Also his birthday falls on the same day of mine birthday. Should I wish him or I just remove my memories of him and move on !!</p>
<p>$ABBY : first of all how long was your relationship .. it should be atleast 1 year old to be called as relationship. </p>
<p>secondly ' don't message below 18' can be for sex and can be that ' he is looking for new bf '.  means he is over you already so move on too. 
but still if you wanna ensure you can ask him directly . and tell him to declare it .</p>
