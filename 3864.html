<p>Hello admin and the readers </p>
<p>my second post :: I'm 23 years old, doing good in my studies, right now in very reputed institute of India. By this time i have been in many big cities and lived life very happily (had many interactions with like minded people in general life while acting as a straight and through facebook and planet Romeo). In my straight acting life I've come to meet many people who use to give slight different attention (+ve one) to me than that of others, usually they look purely macho type, and they have their own group to enjoy like straight guys have. But i feel they have something (sexual attraction towards me) different from others. I too use to like their staring on me. some of them are very handsome to be in gay relationship. But most of the times I don't have that deep friendship with them. Neither i approach nor they (many times due to ego problem). But i strongly believe that i use to be the centre of their each activity when i am present in front of them. They give me priority in any task, take care of me, pop up my name in group, stare me secretly, ask very silly questions that is quite obvious, treat me very gently. I can differentiate that person when he's with me and when he's with others. And the time passes like this and after completion of the course we get separated. And due to not being so good friends we do not contact further. I wish if they had something in their mind and told me at that time then my life would have become a heaven, i wouldn't have to search out guys on facebook and PR. Because i have them in my general life but due to good quality of acting we can't reveal each other. I know many of you will suggest to approach them through social networking sites by making fake Id's but that doesn't work as i mentioned they are very straight acting but somehow attracted towards me. And i really feel sorry for me for not having them as my gay friends despite of having feelings from both sides.</p>
<p>thank you.</p>
