<h1>GCI- Well fuck your feelings. They are useless and they are gonna get you nowhere. I know it's way hard in reality to realize but when you do realize it, you are already in ruins. If he is not gonna be with you, then leave him be. It would seriously do good to you. Try dating someone who would reciprocate your feelings. You don't wanna be on the hook for you best friend.</h1>
