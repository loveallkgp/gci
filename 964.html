<p>Hey viv!
This is some bigtime shit i am going through, i was in love with a guy and vice versa,after few days the feelings changed and he started addressing me as brother and also found a girl for him.
I was all okay and used to not to be bothered but lately im going through emotional imbalances, losing my mind over this shit.It happened cos he had given my number to her and she was talking to me, possessiveness shit aroused we qaurrelled(all the three) I feel bad cos i did yell upon them.I hate hurting people, want to get over it. Though i tend to ignore it, i am still falling into the pit. Spoke to my friends about this they adviced me to ignore him and move on. I do it but at times i tend to stick on to the thoughts and whtever they spoke. It just annoys and makes me sad. Losing the track on self. It sucks to be like this.
I clearly know the consequences of not getting what i want. I am still stuck.
Help me!</p>
<h1>Viv- Bigtime shit.. LMFAO! XD</h1>
<p>Anyways, If he was in love with you then why did his feelings change? Love doesn't swap sides in a few days. Damn! people these days. What you can do is not talk about it at all. When ever you think about it ask one of your friends to take your mind of it. My bestie used to take his time out when I was going through a breakup shit. Friends can be great help.</p>
