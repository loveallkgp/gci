<p>First thing, this is not a confession basically, just an effort of communicating with ya dear admin.
second, dear good admin, u really doing a commendable job ! Kudos bro :) Your efforts to this page despite of being so busy is really praiseworthy. I personally cant imagine myself maintaining such a page 'coz of my busy-ness. :D
Now, I wanna come to what i wanna say, this page Gay India Confessions is really a great one. I wish there would be more pages like this as they play a vital role in awareness and a means of emotional communication between other members of our community. I personally would like to see a Gay Pakistan Confessions ( #GayPakistanConfessions ). Now I'm not a Pakistani, I'm Indian actually. But still I'd want a page like this to be created. I'd have done that, but as i said I cant maintain pages like this yet. 
so, what i wanna say is, you might know someone or some people who might be interested in maintaining a page like this...or there might be some people reading this confession and they might be Pakistani who might be interested in such work. I mean anyone with a SANE can do the job if he can commit a specific time schedule n all. 
All I want is that it'd be better if such good pages increase with good cause so that we can do our efforts in spreading awareness and be linked to each other.
As i said, it was just a suggestion and interested ones can give it a thinking. :) 
Good times people! :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks bro! And yeah if there is any level headed bro of mine, proceed!</h1>
