<h1>GCI- Well, you ever saw his reaction after he got to know that you like him? If he is like "blah at this dude, I don't care, dawg", that means he is straight or can be gay, just that you ain't his type.</h1>
<p>If he is like, "Imma ignore this dude with a frown on my face or make fun of him", that means he's a bully.</p>
<p>If he is like, "oooh he likes me? I'm gonna smile whenever I see him.", that means he is gay himself.</p>
