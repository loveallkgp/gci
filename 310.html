<p>Please admin post it on your wall as
anonymous. I genuinely need some help .</p>
<p>Dear Brthrs n sistrs. M 21 yr old living in one
of the posh areas of Srinagar . M the only son to
my parents with two sisters. M kinda
pampered guy whatever i wanted i was
given. Even my pocket money is more than
some people's monthly salaries. My life seems so perfect from outside.
Problem with me is im a homosexual and i
hate it. Nobody knows it as im just too
straight to be noticed as homo.
Physically im a normal boy i think problem
lies in my fuckin brains. Earlier I used to be very loud and humorous person
but when i came to terms with this prob i
started maintaining a low profile and
behave in an introverted way to evade any
untoward situation. My parents think I'm
into something bad like drugs etc, that changed my behaviour but the truth is
more dreadful. My days n nights go crying, I
want a permanent solution to these miseries. I don't want to be reason of shame for my
family. I wish there was anything that
could reverse it. I googled my prob n found
that gay people are going to burn in hell
eternally... but why?? Am i going to hell for
something that Allah has burdened me with. Though i have never acted upon my
desires . Where should i go neither i can live nor i
can die.!! Why the hell God makes such
mistakes for which not He but the victim is
being blamed and ostracised socially. I
want some help if there is any?
Please help me or pray for my salvation. I don't want to live but i do not want to go to
hell either.</p>
<h1>Viv- Lemme just go point by point. Firstly, homosexuality is NOT an issue. Researches have shown that its 40% genetic and the rest of it depends upon epigenetics. Secondly, there is no solution to this. Thirdly, nothing can reverse it. And lastly, honey i am a practicing hindu myself. There's a long enough list in our texts about activities(anger and laziness make the list too) that could condemn us to hell. One way or the other I am going to hell so why not be a proud gay? Heaven and hell, I feel are just state of mind. Please do not go for internet people or what the religious leaders say to follow. A BIG NO TO THAT. They do not say the so-called word of God. A true maulvi, a true guru or a true babaji will always ask you to love His creation and not to hate anyone. Its their personal hatred that comes out. I am not a mistake. YOU are not a mistake. None of us is a mistake. If you follow God firmly then believe that God always love how true and compassionately you live. If you pretend otherwise to what you are, you will be dishonest and will live a life of lies. For that you will go to hell. So stay true and stay strong. Do what you believe in.</h1>
