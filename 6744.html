<p>I was just in relationship with one guy in college...... After college, we were in relationship  for 2 more years ..... But after that he broke relationship with me because he just get bored now and wanted to marry with some girl....... I was very shocked and sad at that time...... I shifted from my city to other for job reason.... I couldn't forget him at that time.... But of course I can't impose myself on him..eventually I moved in my life but I don't have enough courage to make another relationship.....after 4 years ,I accidentally met him in mall .... He has kid now ....he is living in same city from 4 months ..... Now I have no grudges or special feelings about him ...when i met him in mall ,he  talked nicely.... I thought , i got my friend back .
.....not as a boyfriend but at least a college friend .... I was happy .... He invited me for dinner ..... I even went to his home twice ....he has really nice wife and child .... I was happy for him .... Before 1 week he called me again for dinner. I went as usual but got shocked when he asked me to suck his cock ...he was alone in  his house and drunk ..... I told him it is wrong u couldn't cheat ur wife and I couldn't do this .... He  started abusing me and said I recognized in a mall for sexual need only .... I refused all things and was leaving his house but at last he caught me in door ,dragged inside his home and forced me to suck his cock and fucked me ... At midnight, I just escaped from there......i m just feeling disgusting and more than that ashamed..... I really want to file complaint against him but I can't ruined his wife and child's life..... Even if I file complaint against him ..at the end his family is going to suffer ... His son is barely 2 years old and his wife trust him a lot ...I don't want to ruin anyone's family..... What should I do now???</p>
<h1>GCI- And someone had twee little teenage shit to post here the other day for sympathies...Gaawwddd.</h1>
<p>Look dear whatever is done...is done! now move again with this scar and learn to accept assholes in a yet new light again. I feel sorry for your state and would recommend some very simple things for contemplating-
1- U knew he was a bastard from the very beginning when he said that he was BORED with you, that my boy was a lesson for you but u failed to learn.
2- U had been with him for fucking two years and still he chose to say harshest of the words to you...YAAR sath rehne wale jaanwar se bhi pyaar ho jata hai but he proved that he was a devilish brute with only his carnal needs to be fulfilled at any cost.
3- He literally raped you and you want to do something about it?! Well yes do one thing go and slap him hard whenever u find a chance. That would suffice.
4- If u have a little bit of self esteem left then u must acknowledge the fact that LESSONS ARE REPEATED IN LIFE  UNTIL THEY R LEARNT.
5- In school we learn the lessons before we take the tests but in life we learn we take the tests before we learn the lessons.</p>
<p>P.S- There is nothing to feel sorry about yourself instead he should feel sorry that he lost a gem of a person in you( only if u r not a drag for yourself ).</p>
