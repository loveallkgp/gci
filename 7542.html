<p>Hi admin,</p>
<p>I want to ask a question. Few days back I got super high. I was at a friend's place, we both very drunk as fuck and he smooched me. We ended up kinda making out. While he who calls himself a straight guy, had his dick erect and ready to insert in my ass. I on the other hand didn't get any erection throughout the night. Not only erection, I didn't even feel like doing anything, whenever he would initiate, I would kiss or suck a bit but would stop very soon, may be because I was too drunk and sleepy. Also, I generally get erection when I watch porn etc but that incident got me thinking.So, my question still persists that is it okay to not get erection when you are in bed with a really hot guy(knowing that you are gay)? Also, if there's any problem then what could be a possible remedy for this? </p>
<h1>GCI- Well getting high and having alcohol does affect your erection capability. In most of the cases you do not get hard at all after you are drunk. Have you ever been in bed with someone when you are not drunk?</h1>
