<p>Hey every one,
and 1 question for admin
tu padhta b h ya bs confession page pr hi lga rehta h? kitni back aa gyi h tri ab tk?
now my confession turn
just tell me guys wat wrong i did?
i had chat wid a friend XYZ on fb for few months and after dat, due to our fightings, v came close to each other and started knwing everything about each other..due to so much of our interaction for a long tym, i fell for him and proposed him and he denied and rejected me and deactivated his account and gone somewhere and left me alone. After this , i was very broken.Then few months later, a guy ABC interacted wid me, help me in each n evry way he cud. this thing i like d most and slowly slowly wid passage of tym, v both came close to each other and fell in love.and now twist came.Dat guy XYZ again came in existence and my feeling for him was clear to him already and he aroused dat feelings again in me and again love story happen wid him too.Before i cud take any decision and tell everything about each other,they came to know about each other through a mutual friend of all of us.Now both are agitated .One said me not to call me evr in life and another one is not picking my call even.I m deeply in love wid guy ABC now and dnt want to loose want to loose friendship wid either of them.I knw dat i have done wrong and but i havnt lied to any one. I accepting all my mistakes and promising u dat i will not do it ever in future again. Plz come back in my life.
