<p>Hi, 
I am sharing something in this page after a long time.i am 31 years of age,staying in Delhi as a working guy.i feel left out or total misfit even among our own community.i feel alone and still walking strong with the feeling of being ready enough to walk alone .i have come out to my family 3 years back as a gay guy.i have told my family clear that even if I have to stay alone I will, but just can't lie with my own soul.you know we say,I am not cribbing nor I am trying to moral policing but I feel left out in our own community.why can't I find a friend like we find in straight community? Why the maximum crowd are into sex date?can't we think beyond that.the funny part is God created me with unique quality of not being open to sex until he becomes my boyfriend. Is that a mental block? I also want to talk over the phone and share my feelings.why it is limited to WhatsApp chat and just messaging chat? why there are so many differences created in our own community by our own community?sometimes I wonder, we don't need a straight ally to create differences.the differences already exist in our own community.there is such a big difference in chatting in  messages and talking being present physically with someone .i had a relationship as well but did not last.the person who loved me,I could not create love for him even if we were together for 6 months and I eventually decided to separate.i had been in some more relationship failure as well. life is funny,I don't want to feel depressed but sometimes I can't help, but to think over and over.i can't even share with my family how I exactly feel.forget about the acceptance in straight allies,if the real acceptance begins in our own community,I don't think anybody would feel alone.you know what, the real picture is nobody can walk alone for long time.you feel exhausted.i don't know the expectation is for real, or not but feels like settling down for forever and ever like a movie.thanks for listening :) </p>
<h1>GCIL- Well well....I got ur problem bro....now listen to me very  carefully and stop cribbing(yes u r unknowingly).</h1>
<p>1- First of all try na understand the fact that friendship is not dependent on community or non community people. Lower ur bar of friends' expectations by not marginalising people as gay and non gay.</p>
<p>2- U r a pure demisexual breed. Welcome to the family.</p>
<p>3- U need to build a relationship with urself first. Sorry but u lack that.</p>
<p>4- We get exhausted alone only f we don't know where we are going or we aren't getting lost with the one we love( yes romantic love).</p>
<p>5- There is absolutely no problem with getting laid and then becoming friends if mere hooking up doesn't suffice.</p>
<p>P.S- This is not the era of relationships in absolute terms and is diluted with the tinge of friendship in absolute terms to be precise.</p>
<p>P.P.S- U need to embrace the fact that whatever you do or understand will have repercussions...so try to be on the positive side.</p>
