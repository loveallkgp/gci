<p>Hi guys,
Thanks a lot for your support and advice. I just noticed that my bf posted his confession last night. #1703. There was a typing error. It's 3 nd a half year not 33. I apologize on his behalf. He typed that on his iphone so that might the reason of the typing error. He normally does proof read before posting anything. But I guess he missed this time. I hope we grow older together till that length of time and beyond. We have gay and lesbian friends who are married or together for like 15-20 years. Me and my partner always go to them if we face any trouble in our relationship.
I personally feel that mostly there is no one among the Indian community whom we look upon or can quote them if anyone questions gay relationships. I suggested to my partner that we can start this and will hence influence a lot of lives. He believes that it would risk everything we have worked for.
Both of us are working and drawing good salaries. So the vlog won't be for money. But just to help other gay guys like us. To show that There's light at the end of the tunnel.
Only concerns I have is the issue of privacy and religious fanatics. We live in UK and know a lot of those people.
I guess it's time for me and my bf to have another conversation. I never expected that he would even consider this. I am glad he did.
Let us know guys what you think about this whole idea.
Before I go I would like you guys to listen to song "People like Us" by Kelly.
Stay positive and spread love
Hugs and kisses
Geek and nerd </p>
<h1>Viv- Blehhhhhhh! 30 years ki mistake hi kardi? Duuuhhhhhhhhhh I was actually standing up for you guys that you two are together for 33 years. But now people will say, "Told ya!" on my face! Popat kar diya mera :'(</h1>
