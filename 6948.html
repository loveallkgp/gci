<p>I will introduce myself as a son of a poor farm labourer. I have had fair share of struggles throughout my life. In my childhood, I have spent many days with only as single meal. Through my sheer hard work, I was able to get a junior level post in central govt and moved to a big city. During my college days, I started realizing that I was a gay. I read through some online magazines where everybody presents a rosy picture of 'coming out'. My parents will never understand my situation and looking into their health, if I come out, it may take a toll on their life. I already have a number of inferiority complexes like my english speaking and limited technical knowledge compared to my colleagues and I don't want to add my homosexuality to that list, by coming out. My parents never had any big desires in their life other than seeing me happily married. Though I knew I was a gay, I never felt the need to search for a company. I have now ended up in a situation where neither I want to marry a girl nor have a boyfriend. The struggles which I had earlier days seems nothing when compared to the mental struggles of being a homosexual. Is 'coming out' always rosy for people in a conventional set up like a govt office? Is conventional marriage a solution?</p>
<h1>GCI- This is the by far the most correct grammatical post I have come across in so many months and u say u have weak English writing skills?!</h1>
<p>Well I must confess that I personally liked the post of yours and would love to answer your queries. So here goes-
1- Being born poor is not a curse but dying poor from your psyche is definitely a sin.
2- No! nothing is all hunky-dory in coming out every time by different individuals. It is all personal and all dependable on the surroundings.
3- U don't need to come out to everyone to be happy, because carrying the gay flag is not what is required all the time.
4- NO! conventional marriage is not the solution either because I have seen people confessing on the page and in real life that marriage ruined their life more rather than solving it.
5- U have become self-sufficient, congrats for your accomplishment &amp; kudos to your impeccable thinking! U have actually set up the highest benchmarks for the people of our community. I feel proud to say this as the admin of this page and as an individual.
6- I salute you for what you have become because the kind of practicality and emotional sensitivity you have shown in your words are beyond the comparative measure of any shitty wannabes in our community.
7- You can opt for surrogacy, lead a celibate life, or can either choose 100 other ways to sustain your peace and happiness and that not necessarily means of having a partner.
8- U must not forget one thing that your parents will die one day and if u take any of the wrong decisions for yourself then everything u did for yourself &amp; others shall come to a naught.
9-  Gay people aged 60 have posted about their mental traumas and guilt of leading a 'successful' marriage and have advised not to repeat the same mistake on the virtual world as well and I have personally seen 'failed' marriages of homosexuals too.</p>
<p>P.S- NEVER BURDEN YOURSELF OF BEING GAY, IT NULLIFIES THE LITERAL MEANING OF THE WORD 'GAY'.</p>
