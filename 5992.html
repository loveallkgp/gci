<p>Modi cares a lot about Indian youth and that's because he wants the country's economy to progress but he doesn't give a fuck to LGBT youths. He has maintained his silence and no mediaperson has asked him to make a comment on this issue.
BJP is strongly affiliated to RSS. RSS members are already part of Indian cinema's censor board. They won't even allow any projection of gay movie in Indian cinemas. 
So, what can we do?
Though, the steps I am listing here are difficult to follow-
1. We need to carry out a strong protest or struggle. Something like stonewall riots but stonewall roits was a voilent form of protest against tyrannical forces. We need to carry out a non-voilent protest.
2. It's high time that Indian TV channels start making operas, short movies and documentaries on gays. This will help people to know more about us and prevent all stereotypes which exist in society.
3. We need to form committees and force narendra modi government  to know their stand on section 377
4. Carry out strong influential protests or struggles which receive global attention. We need UN and US democrats' attention. This is how there will be global pressure on NaMo's govn.
5- (your suggestions)

<h1>GCI- hmmm..Well dear everything as u said is already in the process....US and UN are already with Lgbt..THE things that need to be changed and called for attention before that are-</h1>
<p>1- We need to address the issue of gay-hate within the community first.
2- We must be fostering courage amongst ourselves to be ourselves..and that takes time.
3- We must not succumb to the blackmail of marriage, ostracism, bullying or any other form of violence.
4- We should not promote hypocrisy in the name of parental aspirations to be fulfilled by the LGBT kids..
Once we tackle some of these issues-
1- We must understand what kind of freedom and ryts we want.
2- What are the basic categorizing needs of lgbt which must be addressed within ourselves.
3- What are the kind of social structure we shall create with marriage or without..(marriage is already a fucked up institution
not applicable to every individual)
4- What kind of struggle we shall be indulging ourselves in ....bcoz a directionless struggle can repeat the french revolution's plight.</p>
<p>NUTSHELL- Just wait for the govt. to take stands or let them finish their tenure....till then only protest in any form can be the way to say that we exist..bcoz The Supreme court of India has actually fucked up the 377!</p>
