<p>There's hardly any unity or mutual respect prevailing in the lgbt community. Most of the gays are afraid of bisexuals and hate them, likewise most of the bisexual guys and manly gays hate effiminate gays. I am bisexual and I always love to hang out with my straight friends. I hardly have any gay friends. I simply avoid most of them. The reasons are - most of them are very much judgemental and have that incorrigible predilection for invading the privacy of others. Most of them are looking for a handsome hunk or a cute twink. Hardly anybody can think beyond looks. I am quite good-looking so I get lots of proposals. But a time will come when I wont look the same after 10-15 yrs. Then what will happen ? Am I going to get the same attention from these people ? So its better to be with real-life friends only - like childhood friends and friends from school, college and work places.</p>
<p>Another thing - there are bisexual people who want to get married someday. There are lots of reasons behind this. Family pressure, social acceptance etc. But these reasons aint enough. I hardly give a fuck to the social acceptance regarding my choice of marrying the person I love. But one thing does matter to me and it keeps bugging me. 90% of the gays are just sex-machines. Is it possible to lead a happy married life with a guy ? It seems next to impossible. Everyone wants a healthy love life. Life seems incomplete without your soulmate. Maybe because of that few bisexual guys get married. Atleast they can find a way of leading a happy life when they get a baby. Children are the most precious gifts of the so-called god. They can ease your pain to a huge extent.</p>
<p>PS: Read those lines carefully. I know few dickheads would comment here.</p>
<h1>GCI- Some things in your confession are true. I'd like to point out a few things though.</h1>
<p>1) Everyone of us is a judgmental person. Like you said that gay people judge a lot which is in a way your judgment. 
2) I for one, don't care what goes on in other people's life. 
3) Most of the people are seeking sex indeed. What's worse is that being naked infront of a total stranger seems good but it's unimaginable for some people to fight for their rights. "What if someone knows about me?" REALLY?
4) At the same time, it is also true that the people that I have met are all long term relationship oriented. 
5) One last point, babies are not meant for heterosexual couples only. Homosexual couples can have them also. And like you said, they can ease our pain to a huge extent.</p>
