<p>Hi admin. I am a regular visitor of Planet Romeo. Being average looking I find it very difficult to find friends there. Every single guy gives importance to good looks and gym-toned mascular body. Most of the guys I found come there because they seek sex and they know that doing sex with a guy is very easy.....they don't have to bear any hanky-panky that generally happens with a girl. There are many more who demands money from you. It is so depressing that sometimes I feel like crying. But I still visit that site because it is very convenient and safe and there are no other better option. GCI I cannot understand that what is there in store for me in the future. I am not at all interested in girls. So marraige is not an option for me. But I don't find anything meaningful happening to my life either. No surprise that the Supreme Court has found us too small to be counted. It is very easy, I found, to march with candles in your hand, but very difficult to found a partner here. I am loosing hope. </p>
<h1>GCI- Ugh! I am also on it ans barely login there. Apparently apne town ke maine saare log bhaga diye hue hain. But, don't loose hope. There are always those guys who think the same like you, maybe on this page also! You won't even know when someone good enough hits you with feelings. So keep the feelings up. Good luck.</h1>
