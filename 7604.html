<p>I have been dealing with this situation , my ex is a divorced man who is in second marriage both with woman .he is alchoholic and smoker and don't want to have closed relationships . I came to the term of not suppressing my for men very late at age of 26 when I visited USA for my work assignment for 9 months then I returned back and met my ex and fell in love with him . Came out to my family but had a tought of returning back to USA .i got a chance of coming back to USA again in 2014 . He was against this decision but during this 9 months that I spent between my visits to USA while dating him there were a lot of abuses came from him cause I could not understand open relationship aspect of this relationship and was obsessed with the thought of having monogomous relationship and he did not like it hence couple of times he used to abuse and become physical with me . </p>
<p>His second marriage is coming to an end cause this couple has not seen each other staring from the first day and he and me usually have arguments over the fact that whether I should stay in USA or not . He really want me to return back to him but not willing to leave any of his bad habits aside and keep the relationship open and I m not up for it thinking that if he again start abusing me and leave me then I won't have this chance of coming again in USA in future . </p>
<p>Admin : what do you think I should do ? Stay in USA or take a chance of going back to him even knowing the fact that both of us are not from those privileged class of people who At any point of time can decide to leave India and settle down anywhere elsec</p>
<h1>GCI- Why is your decision to be in the US is related to him? It should be your decision and yours only. If you want to live safely, freely and have a better opportunity, then by all means, stay in the US. You don't have to be with a guy, who fucks your brain and doesn't even washes his dick after getting the chocolate swirl on it.</h1>
<p>Get over his ass. Honestly, there are a lot of guys better than him. To be clear, I am not putting polygamy in the dirt category. If you want to have a monogamous relation, find a guy who feels the same. If you can't take shit from no one, don't force your shit on anyone either.</p>
