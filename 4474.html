<p>hiii to all....I just want to share something and what I want to share. ....I need ur view points too....
today in my clg we have a unofficial group discussion about gay people. ..... and you know what. ...someone said that gay couples has no future. .... They can just live together but can't give birth to a child so if people starts to turn gay then where the nature system will go...... at this I said k see all people r not gay it's only a small fraction so don't worry. ..... I want to know better answer so as to shut his mouth</p>
<h1>GCI- Say to them that giving birth doesn't make a family. Its the care and affection that makes a bond of the family. Gay people can always adopt kids that are orphan or are underprivileged. Something that is rarely seen in heterosexual couples. Homosexual couples can have kids through surrogacy if continuing the "bloodline" is so important. Also, it is not just that family structure is meant only for heterosexual people. There have been cases in which kids run away from their homes, parents beat their kids, give birth to kids just to "show off" to the society that they are fertile enough and not care for them much(I have seen such families). Atlast, no one is perfect, neither homosexual couples not heterosexual couples but atleast for us having a family is not a social enforcement or a responsibility by the family. It is our choice and if we choose to have kids, we are awesome parents.</h1>
