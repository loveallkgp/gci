<p>For the past six months, I was home, trying to get comfortable with myself and my sexuality. Now I have to go out and for job. But I am feeling very scared/nervous, coz I am slightly afraid of meeting people! Next I don't have really good friends at the place, so who do I stay with? I have a few acquantainces, but If I get close, there's a chance of coming out. There are too many thoughts in my mind. I know I have to go! So what would be the best way to face this situation? Should I take up job closer to home or farther? How will go? Lord help me please. GCI guide me please! Thanks.</p>
<h1>GCI- You are bothering too much. Take me for example. I never plan anything. I just let things be. What if things doesn't plan out the way I want?</h1>
<p>You cannot plan an area for your job. You will get it where ever you are called and on your performance. You will get to have a roommate who will not be of your choice. </p>
<p>All of this is coming because you are too much in your comfort zone and an introvert. You may have social anxiety. Start learning to not care what people think. That has always worked for me.</p>
