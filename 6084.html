<p>In context of confession #6079</p>
<p>What that man did to his brother was wrong. I was a victim of child abuse too, by my own cousin. I still remember everything clearly, like it happened yesterday, even at that time I was just 5. I am not sad because of what happened to me, nor do I need people's sympathy. I don't blame him for anything now. And have forgiven him, even before him asking for a forgiveness. There was a phase in my life when I didn't accept myself for what I am. And I always uses to think that I would have had a NORMAL life if that incident never happened on the first place. I believe its fine to feel this way. But sooner or later everyone has to realize that THIS IS WHAT NORMAL IS. I was BORN NORMAL. There is nothing wrong with me. And that I am happy and thankful for everything I have today.</p>
<p>I just wanna say one thing to that confessioner that Go and apologize to your brother. And talk to him about it. Things will be fine between you. It will take Time, it always does. Because I would have liked it if my cousin would have talked about it too.</p>
