<p>I want to advice the effeminate bottom friends here. You are not weak. I also was like you almost 80% effeminate. Whole world made fun of me. Then I fought back. I spent lot of time studying manly behaviour. I changed my walk, talk expressions. I started fighting with others and teased girls like straight men. Today no one suspects me. I enjoy gay life on side but am totally manly in society. If I could do it with 80% effemination anyone above that can surely become manly. Don't loose hope and fight hard.</p>
<h1>GCIL- First of all there is no such word such as 'effimination'.</h1>
<p>Secondly there is something you should have understood while writing and that is, ''correct choice of words''.
Third, I agree with you on being 'polished' but not in a subtle patriarchal (Horseshit) way u suggested.
Fourthly, you practiced eve teasing...sorry we are NOT going to give u a medallion for that so called straight behaviour...Pathetic it is!!!
Next time if u don't wanna hear BUGGER OFF then choose the ryt kinda words that doesn't derogate anyone. 
CHHOOSS!!</p>
