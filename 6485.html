<p>What up fam ? (Is it just me or other people also feel this Lgbtqqiaap thing is a big qtiyapa ? I mean we are inclusive , we dont need a name tag to show it :/ )
Alert : Rant of a middle class small town gay guy
 I just wanted to know what makes us as a community so hypocritical of each other ? Last month I was talking to a guy from delhi and something came up and he was like dont say l<em>nd  , it's d<strong>k and as it turns out d</strong>k is sexy but saying l<strong>d is being a cheapster (cmon now you're from delhi not dublin ) 
 Last week a kashmiri guy (ik , hot ryt) was explaining to me how he is a pure "top" but on in bedroom , he'd much rather give me his ass to f</strong>k (yeah , i fuck pure tops , this wasnt even power bottoming , im docile twink af) 
Start chatting up with a guy and the moment you say you're a bottom , he'll star asserting his masculinity . (not generalising but most people do that ) He'll go like hey man , idk about you but im closeted and lets keep it discreet . Not all bottoms are flashy just the way all tops dont have 6 pack abs -_-
Another big problem in this country , all real people are sitting with fake profiles </em>._. And if you contact them , the ones having <em>insert random hot guy</em> as there profile pic , all they care about will be sex . 7 years on internet and I didnt find a single guy who'd be into a relationship , dafaq India ? 
Wuss ass people will make comments about muslims and low caste people and then be like you had sex with a muslim ? muslims are sooooo hawwwwt blah blah 
So dear India , all I want to say is this : Stop Judging , Start Accepting , the kinda treatment you expect from people , try giving to others IN YOUR COMMUNITY </p>
<p>P.S. : Unless you are an Oxon , no one gives you the right to comment on someone's english . </p>
<p>Sincerely desi ,
AJ</p>
<h1>GCI- I am so sorry sire but its THEIR problem and we must not forget that NOT ALL fake people are real on FB and vice versa!</h1>
<p>N.B- U don't need to be an expert or a lexicographer if u see a wrong thing written and u know that it is indeed WRONG!</p>
<p>P.S- There are sane people too but all that is needed is to be multiplied with the other of the kind!</p>
