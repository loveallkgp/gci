<p>May be most of you guys wont agree to what I am saying but still .. I am absolutely fed up of our fights to remove 377 by peaceful means .. No way some pride walks or making LGBT videos or writing LGBT articles is going to remove 377. </p>
<p>Recently I was reading a speech from the African-American community regarding their fight for equal rights and it said that NO ONE EVER JUST GIVES YOU YOUR LIBERTY/FREEDOM, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT AND TAKE IT.</p>
<p>I think we have to change the way we are doing things right now I think we should try new things. Why not follow Gandhi Ji's method, i mean we can just go on Hunger Strike till death outside the SC or the Parliament till they remove 377 may be they wont listen if 10 or 100 people are there but what if 1000, 10000 or even more people from our community strike together. May be they will beat us or may be they send us to jail, hell may be they will beat us to death but if 377 exist none of us or our future will ever live free.  </p>
<p>Like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose said, 'Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom' and our freedom fight needs some blood our blood unless we protest peacefully by putting our own lives at stake no one is gonna give us shit forget freedom.</p>

<h1>GCI- While I do not condone violence, at times it is required, but there are other ways for it. Our entire political system has to be replaced. Those idiots that sit in the parliament, those fools who do nothing but divide people and those creeps who have tonnes of rape and murder cases against them, are the ones who are running our country and those are the ones that we trust with the future of our great nation. That's where we have to start from.</h1>
