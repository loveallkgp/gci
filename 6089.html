<p>Hi Everyone, 
24 M Delhi</p>
<p>"Few Things Left Unsaid"</p>
<p>I am writing this here because I have never shared it with anyone, not even my with my best buddies,I wanted it to be with myself but I want it out of my head, its consuming me day by day.. I ll start from the very beginning..</p>
<p>I was in a relationship for almost 5 years, I always took my boyfriend as my destined soulmate , a Teenage love, with a lots of fights and care for each other, gradually transformed into a matured relationship.. he was everything for me, and so did I was for him.. 
But things didn't go out the way we planned and destiny separated us.. We broke up.. 
I left everything and just came back to home, spent about 1.5 year in my room, alone and dealing with what happened! It was like I was robbed of everything and was left naked on a foreign land.. Eventually I gathered myself and started working.. by profession I am an Engineer.. After coming to Delhi, life gave me a few loving gay friends to whom I spoke my heart out, everything that remained unsaid and just to myself.. Felt better and started to move ahead in life though I wasn't looking for a relationship or a love to happen for sure.. for me it all ended with my Ex..</p>
<p>But this November 2014 a guy came in my life, don't know how it all happened, destiny brought us together..both of us just saw each other in a gay party and somehow we met later..
He is in his early thirties, way older than me and unmarried, never been in a relationship, concerned about just dates. . When I came to know about this it was a little awkward, but it was ignorable, I don't know how? 
Everything about him was way too weird for me.. Sex never happened between us, as per him he wanted to look something way beyond sex in me, maybe a relationship.. We just met 4 times, in a duration of 1 month, after first  three consecutive meetings in the first week I realised That I have started to feel something for him.. unfortunately I had to go home because of some reason so we didn't meet for about 3 weeks but we used to talk over phone.. Initially he meant just a friend to me, maybe more than that but I never made any move.. it was his call to stay online with me over calls and chats..whether it be the fixing of first meeting, planning future with me to an end to everything.. I never said anything, never complained, never judged.. I tried my level best to save it.. for me it was a blessing, this new feeling blooming around. .
On the 4th meeting, things were quite different, I was at his place and he was at mine's. .I was way too much into him, and he was pretty casual.. felt like i was fooled..that day I swore to myself that I will never talk to this guy again, I just wiped my tears and walked away.. He never gave me a chance to say anything, whatever he wanted, he did and I just followed.. 
Thing is he tried contacting me after that, messaged twice on whatsapp to start a conversation and called once but I didn't receive.. </p>
<p>I want to be with him, but what all he has done I don't wanna talk to him again.. I have a lots of unanswered questions which I wanna ask him, I wanna fight with him.. but I don't know why, I wont be able to fight with him too, I hate him but I love him too, I have never forgiven him, still I don't have any hard feelings for him.. 
"Mai us se badla nahin lena chahta, bas use bhool jana chahta hoon" 
I've never felt this way before, this feeling, its different. .way different than I used to love, that love which now seems so imperfect to me..But all this didn't break me, I came out strong contrary to the last time.. Are these feelings actually those "True Love " feelings, of which the world talks about?..
Those 3 meetings were heavenly for me, he touched me in ways that was so angelic.. Made me realise love can happen again, and can happen at just a first sight..
I wish I could've written it to him, he deserves to know, its all about him, but I cannot :( ..But I want to share it, Have a lots of friends here, maybe you'll have some advice for me, or maybe you can help me to see it with a different angle.. Everything will be helping I know fr sure.. but I request you All from the Deepest core of my soul, please don't criticize him, 'maybe uski kuchh majburi rahi ho' :( </p>
<p>"Yoon to solah saawan aaye gaye, 
Gaur nahin kiya humne, 
Bheega mann ka aangan is martaba, 
Kya jaane kya kiya tumne ?"</p>
