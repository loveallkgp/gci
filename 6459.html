<p>HOPE !! such disastrous thing , from childhood I kept on hoping for something or other , some I got some didn't .... From the day I realised I was different, I ain't like any other man , still I hoped that ill find a man who will make me feel special.. In fact I fell in love with a guy desperately crazy. I am mad behind him but never got enough courage to tell him that. There are times when I just stared at his dp with tears filled, shaken, listening to ed sheeran and John legend hoping that one day I'll tell him everything I feel !!! But now I feel hope is dangerous , its killing me from inside , making me sick , depressed , sad , hollow inside ..... I always should've faced harsh reality instead of hoping !!! Typing all this still I hope one day everything will change .. </p>
<h1>GCI- Everything will change if you cut him from your life. Don't stare at his picture, make him a stranger and try to forget about him. Change will not happen until you make an effort to change yourself.</h1>
