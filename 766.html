<p>i am having a gay roommate, he is very cute, gentle bottom, since i knew it frm the begining but he confessed it to me few weeks ago. the thing is i like boys too but i dnt hav figures on him coz he is too feminine........thats just nt my taste. he is a lil embarrassment as i am a closeted.  but he is very good by nature and everything.........i had an affair of his classmate.......we had some hot sessions which he was a secret witness.......i dnt want him around.....help me guys....he knws about my sexuality n if i do anything bad to him he may publicize it........</p>
<p>$ABBY : lol .... why would you invite him in your so called ' hot sessions' .. to ask if you were doing it right or not . by the way if you don't like him as person ... move out and get a new pg /flat and don't further talk to him or give him any explainations just tell him to stay away from you . further more if he tries to ' bully you or blackmail you ' remember you know his secret too.</p>
