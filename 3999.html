<p>Dear Admin,
Its great to hear all these stories from people who go through a similar problem, each day of their lives. Thank you for providing this platform :)
I am a gay man and have never had any romantic or physical relationship. Initially, when I came to terms with my sexuality, I was looking forward to a normal life where I could have a loving relationship. I turned to online dating sites (primarily PR) for help, but was immensely dissapointed. Most of the people there were only looking for fleeting sexual encounters. Secondly, most of the people seemed really crass with no semblance of intellect. I really did not have much expectations but what I found was very dissapointed. I now feel no hope for a relationship and I really don't want to give up. I really liked your point about 5-month-wait for sex. That's how I want to approach my relationships. To be friends first.
Can you please suggest how I should go about it? Thanking you in advance.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, I got this idea from one of my friend. When he was in the initial stages of dating his boyfriend, they both has sexless dates and in that meantime they knew each other. They talked, went to movies, had dinners outside, met each others families(it was just my friend going to his bf's home though). Its just like the old school romance when love slowly builds up. Only when they knew that they were perfect for each other, they had sex.</h1>
<p>Mostly what happens is that two guys meet, meet a fair few times, say "i love you" and then hump on bed. After a few months the spark dies and they are left in the verge of break ups. </p>
<p>Now, the type of people that you mentioned are really out there. You just have to interact with more to reach the right one. In between, don't feel bad if someone leaves you. It would be good if they leave you. You just don't worth them. Have a good life.</p>
