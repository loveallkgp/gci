<p>I know repeating same things as all does wont make any sense still i wanted to pour my heart out and no place is better than this to say something.
I was been a great time for me someone just was the part of my life i found him from no where on fb(real ids) and we started to fall for each other. We used to meet i knew he had a gf (idk why he had one bcz acc to his attitude no grl cud tolerate her still..) then he gave me gifts wrote poems fr m and disappeared. Idk how but he came bck we had a night stay and he kissed me we had a kiss for a long long time(first time for so long i kissed) and then he disappears again. I knw where he is wht he is doin cz of one of our mutual frnd. I knw this stry might confuse you due to lacking of all the things yet... every male frnd i meet kisses me atleast once on my lips but wht i wnt is a sincere reln which i think is vry hrd where ppl jst seek sex making there fake ids
P.s. i just logged in frm my fake acc after a very long time to see if something has changed but ans is NO. </p>
<h1>GCI- Well do you think that as the byproducts of a hypocrite society will change? No. That's why I do not come on this profile often.</h1>
