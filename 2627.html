<h1>GCI- Most definitely it is a crush. When you have a crush on a person you go through all of those symptoms that you wrote. It can't be love if you meet a guy for a few days and get into a relationship. Its my view, not everytime it holds true. Give it a few more days and you will forget him. BUT, if you do think that he can be a good partner and IF he show positive signs, then you can approach him. If you are sure that he can't love you then you should definitely back off.</h1>
