<p>Hi People,
I am 28 years old guy, well settled in Canada. I was planning my vacations in India and was looking for someone to show me around some cities, maybe fun along the way. I got in touch with this guy and after few conversations he fell for me. I don't have great looks and was not expecting it. He is head over heels for me. I don't know whether his feelings are genuine or not. It could be all fake or all true, I have no clue. It seems like genuine, but what can I say. And even if his feelings are true, then also I can't force myself to have the reciprocate that. Love comes naturally and can't be forced. So I am here clueless. He begs me to love him back and I am mostly speechless. I haven't met him and don't him that well. It's quite strange for me that only after a few conversations he said I love You. It would take me months before I utter those words. What should I do? What do you think?
Regards,
Preet </p>
<h1>GCI- Say these very things to him. As far as you know he could be a gold digger because you are a mighty NRI from Canada. No one can fall in love within a few conversations. Even if he is saying the truth, it can be nothing more than a crush. Just explain him all of this because you are the mature one here.</h1>
