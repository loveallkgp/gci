<p>Hey everyone, I was wondering that aren't we all a bit carried away by many 'non facts' of our community?! So as a result of putting on my thinking cap I came up with some really mind baffling issues. I see many posts regarding sex seekers, biphobia, trans-hate, and even people with poor personality blaming it all on being in the bracket of lgbt. Well to ans these problems I would say that it is not because of bisexuals or trans people all the time that gays are misunderstood but due to 'sexually fluid' people also and people who are charade masculinity. Sex seeking is not bad provided we practise safe sex and are not drags, some just have high libido, get over it!. I don't even get the idea why are people afraid of trans people.Even many gays feel that trans folks should not be included in LGBT. Further I would opine that why are we living with so many self-contradictory beliefs when at the end we get nothing but self-guilt and self hate. Y do feminine gay men mock other feminine gay men?? Isn't that stupid? Feminine gays should stop feeling less than human and stop inflicting pain on other feminine gays. Lesbians should stop mocking butch and femmes to feel good about themselves. Also I feel that we as lgbt have collective responsibilities towards our community on all the fronts. We need to be self sufficient, must help other members of our community, must not look down upon sex(but stay away from fake lovers and fake relationship mongers). We must build up each other, join LGBT groups online or NGOs, build a network where we can help each other in any way possible. We must apprehend the strt community that we maybe the worst but we are the best too and superior to them on many fronts. In a nutshell I would suggest-
a- To learn more about ourselves
b- We must build our community piece by piece.
c- We should be an inspiration to the coming generation that we did all the hard work as far as possible and inculcate the same in them.
d- We should stand united inspite of disliking traits of others.
IF we are able to make ourselves strong unitedly then one day there shall be no need of a gay confession page filled with the kind of posts  we presently read.
Love and peace to u all!</p>
