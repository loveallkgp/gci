<p>hii my age is 24..completed my grades before fee years. and searching for govt job. my lofe life has become hell.</p>
<p>I am having stammering from my birth and due to it i am unable to get job. whether state public service or UPSC ya any else job. daily I cry alot for this. and now from two months situation is like my family is also not supporting.</p>
<p>dad shouts and says tu apne aap krta kuch aisa nai hota.. humae kyu nai hota.. I keep myself close in my room. dad says like he has spended more than 20 lacs behind me in my studies he wants that back.. and my stammering is killing me.. I don't have any hope nw.. feeling much alone. planning for suicide nw</p>
<h1>GCI- What type of parents do that? Demanding money like that? Its not your fault that you stammer. It can happen to anyone! Its your parents' fault that they can't understand that. DO NOT THINK ABOUT SUICIDE. Just develop the skills, whatever you have and then work on them. Just don't feel let down. In know it is a biggest pain when your own parents can't understand you but one way or the other you have survive.</h1>
