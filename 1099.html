<p>When I surf on facebook (and any other sites), one thing disgusts me, about Indian Gays.</p>
<p>As a gay man living in India, where homosexuality is a criminal offence, it's my first job to stand and fight for rights. And we can eradicate the persecution against homosexuality, if and if, we are united and fight against it.</p>
<p>I have seen many gays shouting to give them rights, but when I see most of the accounts of the Indian gays, I find disgusting, because they have very dirty contents. Instead of decent and sane contents, they have nude pics, dick pics, ass pics in their gallery; they have sexually explicit pages in their likes list, they are in sex-seeking groups, even they are present in the groups that looks for the constructive future of the gay community and their wall contains nothing but their sex seeking posts and the desires to fulfill their lust. Is fulfilling your sexual desires is more important than fighting for your fundamental rights?</p>
<p>When I see the profiles of the gays in the western, Australian, European and some other parts of the world, such things are very less. Their profiles are more decent and good to visit then the gays in India.</p>
<p>I am seeing only a countable people are truly, responsibly and seriously taking their sexuality and fighting for their privileges, rest all are treating their sexuality as a tool of fun and lust. Why the Indian gays like this? (I am not saying that only Indian gays are like this, but as I am in India, I am pointing towards Indians.) Can't we gradually bring a revolution? Can't we change ourselves and be responsible and serious about sexuality? Can't we make our profiles clean and sane so that when other people visit our accounts, they feel good about us, rather than disgust on us? Can't we unite ourselves, strengthen the community and be strategic to make homosexuality (and all of its aspects, including marriage, adoption, anti-discrimination laws, etc.) legal in India?</p>
<p>If we don't have rights to live openly, how can we think to climb further?</p>
<h1>Viv- Marvelously wonderful thinking. But you know people are really comfortable in getting naked infront of strangers but they don't want to talk about their rights. Personal experience and I felt hopeless when I interacted with some people in my city. You know revolution doesn't happen overnight and certainly leading for a right cause isn't everyone's ambition. I have a mind for it, hence I get in contact with those who believe the same. There were those people who were still looking for sex in various groups on 11th dec, 2013 after 10:30am, and there will always be those for whom the fight for rights will not matter. Your right to fight is in your hand. You will get those with you who feel like you in your journey and don't let uninterested people ruin your ambition.</h1>
