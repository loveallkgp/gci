<p>Today i was in the public place searching for a similar minded guy at a gay point in my city. Then came this boy showing his dick to me and asking me to do sex with him. i denied . i said nah i'm not interested. he forcibly slapped me back of my head and punched me in my stomach . i was in pain. i started resisting. nope am not interested. he continuously calling my gan*wa and beating and humiliating me. he was more stronger than me . i was just slim. we got into fights. hardly i made myself to run away from him. he started calling his other friends on phone till that time i was fled .
i dont know what to do. people are compelling even if youre not interested. then beating and abusing, name calling .
am a bit depressed and feeling of no hope in this world. people are so rude and ill mannered and with a disgusting behaviour.</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, why do you have to go to a cruising spot to search for a guy who doesn't want to have sex? Only those guys go to cruising spots who want to hump around with random strangers and are total freaks. And now you are blaming the people in general. Those guys will do what they want and you cannot stop them in anyway. You were just a murga for them. Kal tum the to kal koi aur hoga. Best way is to not go there again and encounter with such riff raff.</h1>
