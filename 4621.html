<p>Hello Admins and friends.</p>
<p>This is not a confession about wrongdoing or deception but about my confused thought process.</p>
<p>Whenever I see a attractive guy with good features , I in start thinking that how cool that boy's life must have been. Especially on sex life front. Then I imagine myself to be like that guy. I in my mind portray that i m enjoying good sex life with girls and boys alike. i wish that i have a loving gf as well as loving bf. sometimes I portray to be like a Casanova. in short i imagine myself to be a smart handsome bi sexual top.</p>
<p>yet the reality is that i have more gay tendencies than bi tendencies.</p>
<p>am i different from other gay boys? What exactly am I? in gay terms am a bottom or vers or top ? am i gay or bi ? Sometimes I feel I am asexual. All these questions always remain unanswered in my mind.</p>
<p>the purpose of this confession (rather status ) is exactly to find do there exist anyone else too who have similar tendencies ? is there anyone else similar to me ? or am I alone ?</p>
<p>P.S.: I am a ordinary guy. I have never done sex with any boy or girl.</p>
<h1>GCI- So many questions? It feels like I am in a viva. You need time to figure yourself out. People can take more than 30 years to get to know themselves. If you feel for both, you are bisexual. If you feel just for guys and talking about lady parts creep you out, you are gay. And there are many people who are confused. I was once too.</h1>
