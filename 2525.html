<p>I really wonder what the admin does all day. 
1. Does he or she work for a living?
2. How long does he or she work?
3. Whether the admin is a human being or replies are generated by the computer? 
4. Lastly if he or she is a human being is he single?
5. How much time does he spend replying to posts? 
6. Is it one person doing all this or is it a group of people? 
7. How does he or she handle his frustration and annoyance with ridiculous posts?</p>
<p>Sorry admin I am asking you too many questions but I really admire you a lot. Just wish that my life partener is as witty and mature as you. Lastly please let me know if u r a male or female and if you are good looking .</p>
