<p>$Abby : to be frank i don't believe in prayers unless its matter of somebody's life whom i love . i don't bother god for such small things which are not even problems . </p>
<p>you are just 19 and its not even the start of life yet and you are talking about relationships. see i can't even say to ' act like an adult coz you aren't ' but as you are 18 plus i will say figure it out instead of crying and being emotional. go to him and talk calmly like you are just talking instead of shedding tears in front of him and blaming him ( this way he will feel ashamed and won't tell you anything ) . ask what he feels and why he don't want to be in relation anymore . if tells okay if he doesn't don't push him . if he wants to  end it i think you shall end it too. move on and think of your career first ... don't let this small happening effect your career . make a career first... there are whole lot of years after that to be in relationships and to shed tears on them .</p>
