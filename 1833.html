<p>I don't want to die. Death seems permanent solution to all problems. Now that my partner broke up with me, no i am not unhappy about it. To specific love or relations were never meant for me. "I was alone and will always be". No matter how optimist you are, the above line is fact for most of the queer people expect a few lucky ones. Apart from this, my parents are not so happy with me, they are not going to accept my sexuality ever. Obviouly there will be all those melodrama and all once i come out to them. So after that either i have to marry or stay alone(read the quoted sentence) so either ways life is going to be painful. So why to waste it. Bye. Hope i won't be alive to read your replies. Cheers </p>
<p>$ ABBY $ : giving up is sign of weak people and i want my gays to be stronger and powerful. </p>
<p>think over it again . in few years india is going to make gay marriage legal . no parents and guardian can take a stand once you are an adult . come on study well , get a job ..stand on your own feet and live with the person you love . if your parents can't accept that's their problem. ( a parent fails if their kids are not happy , committing suicides , having tensions .. that is parenting fail ). being a parent is like having a 'protection shield ' around .. no matters what happens untill their souls leave their bodies... parents protect their kids no matter what . . </p>
<p>the thing is right now you are depressed about you breakup . who ever the fucking guy that was he didn't deserved you so move on .</p>
