<p>You guys r doing a great job, keep up the gud work. Well my confession is, i met this guy, we met often and i was so attach with him, at first he gav me his ring, said "i love you etc, When i was so into him, now he says he wants to get married, since his younger bro got married and his dad expect him to get married too now, he says he was never into me, rather playing with my emotions . He says we r friends with benefits, we still chat, meet up for fun but i cant forget him, i love him so much, m shattered now, please suggest and people with negative remarks, keep yourself, coz you dont know, how it feels like to love someone so deep, with all your heart</p>
<h1>GCI- Next time you meet him, say goodbye to him forever. It will do you good. You were played and you are still sticking to him. I know love is blind but it shouldn't be senseless(sorry to use the word). Throw his ring onto his face, ask him to get the hell out of your life. Do not ask any questions or ask him to return. Don't ask for sympathy at all. Have some self respect and think about yourself here. He is getting married and you are shattered. So see whom of the two of you requires the attention.</h1>
