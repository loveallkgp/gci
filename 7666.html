<p>Almost 5 and half years back...I met my BF here...we liked each other and hit it off right from the start...and we have been together ever since...We promised one another that One day we will be married if in a country where it is legal,else we'll live in regardless...it was great..living loving..best times of my life.. Until...3 years ago..right after my college ended and moved bk home from hostel...
My mom found out the secret box where i kept all his lil gifts and love letters and love post its he ever gave me...I was forced to come out... It was a very ugly experience...plus with the unavailability of job for the career I've chosen...it has come to a stand still for 3 years.. However she's somewhat accepted me now... but for 2.5 years it was something else.I was depressed. I was lost.I was in hell..I don't wanna go into all those details. But for more than a year I have seen my BF is moving away from me.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks back,I had to push the topic cause I needed to know where this was going. And he finally said it out loud,He 'doesn't feel it anymore'. May be I knew,I knew for a long time. But didn't wanna believe it.Instead settled for his excuse that he's just too tired to be going out anymore just the 2 of us. He stopped keeping his words and when I pointed that out he stopped making any such promises all together,just said,"I'll try" and then never follow up.</p>
<p>All I wanna know is...Is it dead? From what I heard from him,he says he just doesn't feel it,So should I just abandon the hope that may be there's a chance?He says that he loves me,but isn't in love with me.</p>
<p>I have almost gotten a new job..it's just around the corner,but what I was doing I was working hard to save what he had. To make things better. </p>
<p>I need advises to what my options are. And Is it really time for me to accept its over.</p>
<p>Sorry if it was long post and quite dry as i understand..tbh just too numb to express myself properly at this juncture.</p>
<h1>GCI- It is a two way option for you. You can either make it work, or you can break it up. I want to ask you one thing though. Was your bf there when you needed him? If he was there, then it might be worth saving for.</h1>
<p>In any case, do whatever makes you feel happy. You don't have to be in something just for a sake of it. If both of try to make it work, then be together. Maintaining a relationship is a lot of work. If you don't take care of it, it will fall away.</p>
