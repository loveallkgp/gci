Well he is the bestest guy one could have in respect of love,trust,faith and CARE. As a bestfrnd i cant cheat him saying i love him as a lover. ofcourse i love him but as my bestest buddy. I tried bt that love feeling is nt comming. He changed himself does excercise already got muscles.,calls me every single day 2,3 times takes care of me. offers me sit in crowded metro.. if sumone stands weird he says mere piche aja. goes with me and loves me unconditonally. how i can cheat such a pure love? so i always try to be honest with him i m nt feeling love currently. nw what i can do?</p>
<h1>GCI- Decide what you want. If you wanna be just friends or you want to be lovers. The way you two are behaving its already like an unannounced relationship. It will not be cheating if you say you love him. It will be called as taking a step forward. You two clearly need to have the talk.</h1>
