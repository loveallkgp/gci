<p>this is kinda my second confession,
i was chatting with this guy from quite a while now,but never met him..exactly my type,used to talk on phone for hrs but unlike some silly guys i ve come across, hez very sensible and practical though an asshole sometimes....finally there came a day when i met him!uaaah just the sight of him,heartpounding,throat thickening!i couldnt resist but touch him so hugged him right there!!he was everything i wanted him to be and he liked me aswell(kinda came as a shock to me though,i dont really consider myself to be very good looking!) infact he said that i m very appealing!we spent the whole day together had sex,lots of fun,hung out together was totally fun and perfect!couldnt ask for more!!we are still seeing each other.....
p.s-left out the important part,when i was leaving he leaned forward and whispered i love you!!(MAGICAL!! )and kissed me on my cheek..</p>
