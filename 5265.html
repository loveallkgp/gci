<p>Hi guys,
I am confessing yet again on this platform...Wanna say that I was out on valentines day with someone(no special friend though), and had kept my diary in the open where anyone could see it....but had forgot to dump one thing...and that same thing got discovered by my mother...and she asked me the next day about it....I answered calmly as i could as i was busy on the phone with my wtsapp...she had hid my 'thing' and asked me about it...yes it was a 'condom'....and seeing the confidence on my face she was baffled a bit and said that she had hid it ...but why did i keep it??? I answered her ...then what do u expect from a guy in his twenties to keep with himself.....candies??? she didn't say anything..and i continued..due to non usage of this ur daughter in law had to go through an abortion...is that OK???she was silent and after an hour concluded and said that ....its ok u kept it ..whether it was urs or ur friend's..doesn't matter to me...but i must not find u in any kind of trouble or bad company..this is all what i want to say!!! and from now on be more focussed towards ur life and career...I want to see u somewhere....can't all mothers be like this??? I felt so blessed to have a mother like her... Sorry it was nothing gay in it...but the confession came from a gay guy...
Thanks for reading guys...hope the admin posts this!</p>
