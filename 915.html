<p>I learned from many other couples to compromise and adjust in order to survive in a relation. Upto what extent we can do with out losing our self respect??</p>
<p>Any relation relation has ups and downs. Out of all Indian gay relation is most Unsecured.</p>
<p>I came out of relation recently.. This is not new for me... May be I am tired of failures... I am not getting feelings towards anyone. Should I just enjoy sex with guys with out connecting to them or should I just use my hand to be on safe side that I might fallen to him after hook up???</p>
<p>After broke up I never met anyone, some times I feel like my body deserves some fun and I am really worth full for a relation. But I don't have hope to find a right guy for both.</p>
<p>Should I mess around with many guys for sex... He'll no I am not that type... At the same time I feel like I am old school guy thinking like this.</p>
<p>I am confused what to do, I am successful in life and had many hobbies but cannot get out of this confusion </p>
<h1>Viv- Why don't you just take a break from your sexuality? Like from two months? Why do you have to be in a relationship? Its not at all compulsory to be with someone. You have reached a saturation point where you have to loose your emotions so that you can make place for new ones. Enjoy your life the way you want.</h1>
