<p>HELLO Friends ....... Well I am here with You all sharing my Problem that I am facing these days ....and really want you all to please give me your genuine advice and help me come out of this dilemma.
About Me I am a 27 yrs old Very good looking and very well educated and well settled Bottom Guy here from Delhi  and My Boyfriend is about 30 years working with Indian Defence Services. He is also a very manly and extremely good looking Army Chap and he is a TOP....we both are in a relationship since last 9 years and we both love each other very much ... He is so caring n loving and Possessive for me and I too am very much possessive n caring for him.....we both love each other too much and we both are in physical relationship and enjoying each and every moment of our Life with each other
Now the problem is that our respective Families are Forcing us to get married to some girls and we both are not ready for it .........as we all know after marriage life changes and we both dont know  how to live without each other..... We both are not ready to get married to some unknown girls ....... actually we both dont know how to accept a girl and start our life afresh ........... we both dont know how to live without each other...I really am unable to bear this family pressure .......... and he is also not able to bear this pressure .......as a result he is getting frustrated and Life is getting worse day by day ..........Everyday there is a fear of loosing him ........I cant imagine my life without Him and I dont know How I will be able to see him with a girl ... Sometimes I think I should commit suicide...as I cant live without my Love......How can I forget him....These all thoughts have made it difficult for me to Live now
Please suggest what to Do .......Really seeking ur genuine advice...Thank U</p>
<h1>GCI- Watch Brokeback Mountain for making strong decisions and must not succumb to ur family's whims bcoz it shall ruin many lives.</h1>
<p>To clarify on some of the considerations-
1-The govt. serviced people are bound to not act outside the law, but marrying someone of ur own gender is in the law as far as my knowledge goes.
2- U can approach LGBT NGO in Chandigarh, the nearest to u. The other admin shall provide u the details.
3- If u both know that what must be done then there is no other option other than to live with one another and leave ur families.
4- U must make them accept each other and now act as GAY MEN because it cannot go on like this forever.
5- U also need to understand that ur safety, sanity and peace must not be staked at any cost, not even by your families.
6- Its been 9 years and u both are mature and self-dependent, then y r u still acting like teenagers???
7- U r an inspiration to those who are on the path of finding love in the gay world....now live upto the expectations.
8- U can check our post no. 7079 where a gay man of 40 has poured his heart out.
9- U both need to act stable, strong and look for all the possibilities to be with each other in the long run because the longer u delay the longer u will regret.
10- If u both are there for each other then understand that how to save ur jobs, or change them, how to persuade ur families with community help, and how to overcome the situation and emerge victorious.</p>
<p>P.S- U can reach other NGOs and people via Harmless hugs community group or Humsafar trust! Trust me people are there to help us only if we ask for it!</p>
