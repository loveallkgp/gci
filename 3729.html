<p>Hi admin and GIC followers and my manly and masculine gay and bisexual haters as well :)</p>
<p>Gay and bisexual  men are different from other men in society bcz of their feelings and they want acceptance from others but few gay and bisexuals themselves are not ready to accpt little different people.How illogical it is they themselves want acceptance but not ready to accept others.Selfish people </p>
<p>Hi m 21 years old,out and proud gay.Wait wait not just gay but girly gay.Yes u heard it right i m a girly gay and i take a great pride of who i m and i respect evryone whether some1 is of my type or not unlike other gay here who hate other people who are little different from them.</p>
<p>I saw many confessions against girly gay people by masculine and boyish people here.Such gays and bisexuals r bloody loosers hiding their identity critising people like me who hv courage.Such people should die with shame.Before u start to judge girly gay gays,step into their shoes,walk the life they're living $ If u get as far as them,just may be u will see how strong people like me are.</p>
<p>Hetrosexual people hate gay bcz gay people are different from them in feelings.Most of the masculine boyish and manly Gay people hate girly abuse them by saying Hijra chakka trans and don't know what bcz girly gay are little diffrnt than other gay just like gay men are different than other men in society so y dnt u accept diffrnt people?? You urself is different from others but u urself not ready to accpt people who r diffrnt from u ????.Bloody uneducated people don't know that being gay and hijra,chakka and trans are different thing.</p>
<p>Being girly gay,i get rejection from my own gay brothers then where should i go to express myself ? to the hetro people who would tease me and make fun of me ? Earlier i was so proud of my gay community but now feel shameful on gay community ,seeing such haters who are against me.</p>
<h1>GCI- Nahhh don't be shameful, and don't loose yourself to hate. If you know yo are better than those who hate in general, don't bother about it. Keep yourself on the right track and don't care for what the world thinks. There will always be someone to say stuff against you no matter what.</h1>
