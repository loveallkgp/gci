<p>Hii friends... I have been a regular reader of this page... And sometimes I really find some of the confessions funny and some real creepy... So I thought I should also share something... this is not a confession but my experience of life ever since I came to know I was gay.... I m not an open gay.. I am still in closet.. and I think thats way better to live.. its not necessary for anyone to know...
Some people say that gays are not trustworthy and can't maintain good relationship...and they just want sex and stuff like that....but my experience has been wonderful... I came to know that I like boys when I was 13 or maybe even before... Unlike any other gay as a teenager I too had a high testosterone and high libido.. I won't say I was a sex maniac but I lost my virginity at the age of 14.. that was an awesome feeling...coz I lost it to my tution tutor on whom I had a crush... after that I made many gay friends... and then one of a my friend introduced me to the love of my life...with whom I had been in realtion for 9 years...those years has been a fantastic years of my life... we did our school in luvknow, graduation and post graduation from delhi togeather... we were in live in relationship.. but after completion of PG he got job in dubai and shifted with his family.. we both with mutual consent parted from each other... he is living a Happy life with his new life partner there..
After that one year passed by I again got into a relation with a guy with whom I was working with.. I guess the biggest mistake I ever did... he just used me fucked me and left me.. he introduced me to all the bad things such as drugs and alcohol.. I dumped him coz he wanted me to become a slut for him and 5 of his other friends which was unacceptable for me.... but before going away he and his friends used me forcefully... I was totally shattered... I satrted talking lots of drugs and alcohol coz I was so depressed... After 6 months passed by I thought about it that why I am destroying my life... life hasn't end yet... so I joined the rehabilitation center and after 1 year on Jan 2013 I came out victorious...</p>
<p>But I never thought I will fall again in love which did happened when I came back to my hometown Jamshedpur... I met a guy in late 2014... he was nice sweet gentle guy... I was attracted to him so proposed him... And my STARS are lucky that I got him... I love him and he loves me too... and Plans to live with each other for the rest of our lifes...
Some of my gay friends ask me if my parents ask me marry a girl then what will I do... As I hv said that I am a closet gay... but my parents will never force me to marry coz I hv told them that I don't intend to marry coz there are way better things to do in life... And I m firm on my decision...</p>
