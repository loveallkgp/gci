<p>Hi people
I'm gay and i fell for a guy. He already has a gf, who he loves truely. Recently i told him I'm gay and that i love him. He's very cool about it and said i should have told him earlier. Also he's my best friend and i don't want to break his relation with her because they are very good together. But sometimes i get this feeling that he somewhat likes me. He said that he cannot do anything about my love as he is straight, but he has been very supportive of me. I'm head over heels in love with him. I tried to get over him by was unsuccesful. This has been goimg for over 1 yr. My studies are ruined. I try to be only his friend but whenever i see him hope arises in my mind.  How do i remain best friemds with him if i can't help lovinh him?
Plz i need ur precious suggestions, because i don't have anyone who would guide me.
btw thanks for this page. 
Love all.</p>
<h1>GCI- There is still a part in you that believes that he can be with you, or he can turn gay for you. You have been dwelling on false hopes. He is straight and he is being supportive of you, so don't take it in a wrong way. Don't try to hit on him much otherwise you will lose him. Do not make him the center of your life. Try to socialize more, especially with other gay people. He can be your best friend so keep him at that.</h1>
