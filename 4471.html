<p>In response to the confessor who wrote a very overwhelming appraisal and some really practical and accurate observations about me...i wanna say a very BIG THANKS to you...and yes.. I really have been through that path of life which u wrote and what followed was a polished me as u implied( i don't know still to how much extent)....anyways ..those admiring words made me more oriented towards my social responsibility( though virtually)...u heard it right RESPONSIBILITY...i have now taken this page as a very near and dear part of my life...and for guys who send me friend requests ...am sorry if i am not able to accept them all..because having too many friends is not in my priority list..i make friends with people with whom i don't have to talk on a daily basis and who remain near to my heart with the CONNECTION....seeing my flow of comments and taking your desirable scoop out of it....is what i expect if i am doing a good job....I don't pine for being famous here..nor do i like to promote biasedness, hatred, partiality, inequality, pandemonium, gay chauvinism(u read it right) and am strongly against any kind of fanatics too...and as i have the habit to say things in points i will customarily follow my way...1- WE don't need to prove anyone wrong personally to state a right thing which has a universal benefit to it...2- Don't think that being less educated or ordinary looking people are not meant for relationships..remember there is always an imperfect person waiting for us to be perfect with us....human birth is a journey to be true to ourselves and make peace with the world...and for that we must refine ourselves on a regular basis..3- WE are here on this page for a change...but change if directionless can cause more blunder and thus invites sharp criticism which many of us can't face at all....4- NEVER think that we can act perfect..and can make an impact by our extremism...(negative one)..that is equal to spreading poison first and then shouting for a cure and remedy...5- We may or may not agree with each other on petty or serious issues but make sure that doesn't hinder our stand to be UNITED..because at the end of the day....it is easy to to descend than to climb up..GOODLUCK AND GOD KA BLESS...!!</p>
