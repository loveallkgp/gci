<p>Hi admin I am from vrindavan and I am a gay 18 years old boy. I am disturbed for a long time about my sexuality. lots of time I tried to confess but I couldn't but today it is too much that's why I am here to confess. as i have told you that I am gay I am disturbed  for a long time, I was trying to tell somebody first I told to  my best friend and his response was good. then last night I told it to my elder brother but his response  did not make me satisfied. I gave him my diary and I told him that I am gay  first he throw my diary into fire then he came to me and he said whatever you are thinking it is just too bad imagination nothing else most of the boys think like this at this age and he said my mind is full  of rubbish. I was thinking that he would accept me. But he totally refused me and he said that it is the problem of my mind there is nothing like gay it is just imagination. But I have accepted myself as a gay he said that he would help me to recover but I don't thing I need to be recovered. He told me about my responsibility for the family and told me to think about the parents who are 50plus. He said that family have done lots of things for me and it's my responsibility to do lots of things for family. when i said i'll go out of the country he replied that our father is not a rich man and you are not a special. Immediately my mind stopped working, at that time i was listening but I was unable to respond I must say that I was depressed  and my mind was freezed. Then he slapped me two times and he advised me to stop thinking rubbish he told me to move on. im gay bottom and have little feelings like a girl and it's too much hard for me to move on I can't change my feeling towards boys. He said that I am 18 and its the game of my mind  he told me to control myself. in short he totally refused my sexuality. in family he was my first and last hope. what to do admin i've no hope from my family. only my friend is helping me to know about my sexual identity. and my brother also want me to leave that supportive friend. he said me to concentrate on the business. I am worried and suicidal. dear admin may be i'm unable to write cause my mind is not working but please you try to understand whatever I have written and also whatever I couldn't. please help and don't ignore, you are my last hope.
plz help!</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmm...first of all wipe ur tears dear..U r not in this world for being accepted or having rejections all the time....Calm down and have a hug first...dear boy u came out to ur brother..its ok but as we always at GCI stress on being independent..there are some more of the do's and don'ts which u must follow in order to be confident, mature and be well equipped with all the knowledge that is required and necessary to practice in the world of hypocrisy..and they are-</h1>
<p>1-Never come out without full preparation...and that too never to those who are not ready to listen to us...(have a thought on knowing people first).
2- U should always be comfortable in ur skin even if people know about u....if something goes wrong ..deny everything .....deny every known rumour or truth(sabotaging or shameful) about u....just be plain indifferent and for that u must face people in their eye..
3- Suicide is not the solution..U owe urself an explanation even if u die!
 4- Concentrate on being HUMAN...and learn to be a 'good' person..u need more of that instead of becoming a better 'gay' person.
5- Love urself more bcoz we live most of the time with ourselves and we must not be harmful to ourselves by our thoughts, acts and plights.</p>
<p>Remember sexuality is a part of you..not the entire you..so be an all rounder in terms of knowing ur strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>G-luck honey!</p>
