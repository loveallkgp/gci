<p>I'm the same guy who confessed few days ago about having sex with two guy which was unplanned and betrayal from the known guy.</p>
<p>i got tested for HIV and other viral test of blood and also hepatitis B. everything is normal.. i was too much tensed about it.. i got skin rashes around pubic area before test.. now its okay.. but from 2 days.. i have headache, stomachpain, cough like thing coming with stool and i found pinworms in my stool as well.. i consulted about it to doc... and he gave some medicine..
now its okay but headache is not completely gone..
I'm still scared thinking about HIV..</p>
<p>is there any chances again? i elaborate every conditions of mine.. plz can anyone tell is my health condition is okay and it's normal disbalance of my health or bcoz of HIV?</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, the thing that I didn't get from your confession is whether you are HIV+ or not. If you are not then, the chances are that you will not have it and the illness that you are having is because of some other reasons. Stop pondering over it and get treated.</h1>
