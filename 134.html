Hey Admin,
This page is been a wonderful help for me, that's why i thought of sharing my problem with u guys!
Recently i have a group of 4 frnds, me, 2 of my cousin's and a friend of my cousin. Thing's were going all smooth, suddenly i realised that i was falling for my cousins friend. Who is straight, I started dreaming of him day night. well actually he is married, but the thing is i always get attracted towards him. his smile, way of talking, care for me.
I realised it is a bad thing to be in, as he is married.
But then he does something unexpected like when we are tripsie on bike i used to b in middle and him behind me, he catches me from back caresses me and kisses me on neck, and here i fall for him again, i fasted for him twice for getting him in my life.
I dont know what to do, shall i express him, or stay as i am, i dont want to lose him. Please help out guys. Hope ur suggestions work out.
Post it admin. I will b thankful to u.
Love Prince.</p>
<h1>Viv- You may love him, you may say your feeling to him but do not ever expect anything in return. The bitter truth here is that he's married and his wife is his responsibility. You are at a beginning of your age. You will go through these feelings more often in the coming years. He can never love you back the way you want.</h1>
