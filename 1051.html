<p>30 years male from new delhi.
im a gay who acts to be a straight in his life.</p>
<p>by looks, i have a good muscular look and no one can guess that i might be a gay.
so i always easily hide it.</p>
<p>i had a boyfriend when i was in graduation. for almost 3 long years. after he left me, i started dating random guys and had sex with many guys. i even lost the count how many i slept with.</p>
<p>i never fantasy sex with women. i always fantasy guys..even when i masterbate.</p>
<p>things went on. i got a job. though i know im a gay. but still i decided to marry a girl.
because this gay lifestyle is so difficult. i mean so many frequent breakups, then the society never accepts gay ppl. my parents would never accept me. no one would accept.
for them gay probably means -transgender or hijra.</p>
<p>no parents would want a gay child. thats the hard reality.</p>
<p>so i thought a lot on this, and decided that i will end up my gay life..i promised to myself that from that day, no dating with men..no gay porn. nothing related to gay.
and i married this girl 2 years back, when i was 28</p>
<p>things went good for starting months. i got emotionally attached to her. now we have a baby girl.
but i totally failed to stop being gay.
even when i have sex with her, i fantasize about guys to maintain my erection.</p>
<p>i just cant stop this gay feeling. i feel gulity. i cry. i cry a lot.
at the end, i couldnot resist more.</p>
<p>6 months back,i made a account on pr. and dated few guys secretly. had sex with them.
recently i met a guy. he is handsome and also is very nice to me.
he proposed me yesterday.
he doesnt know that im married.</p>
<p>i now stuck in a life of hell. what shall i do?.
i just want to run away with my baby girl and that guy.
im sorry, i dont love my wife. i cheated her. and i cant cheat her more.
i dont know why god made me a gay.
how will i live my life like this! i even think of suicide sometimes. then i see my baby.
and i just dont know wat to do!
am i so shameless to not control my gay part.
why i break my promise!</p>
<h1>Viv- A clear cut example for those gay guys who think that getting married to a girl will make everything right. Suicide will never make anything right. It will make things difficult for you bf, wife, little girl and your parents. You can have a talk with your wife and make her understand everything. You have lived in the shadows for other for so long. Now is the time to breath just for yourself. There is no changing possible so you cannot control your gay part at all. It is an eternal part of you. You should have never married in the first place but there is no crying over spilled milk. Have a new direction in your life they way you want not what others want.</h1>
