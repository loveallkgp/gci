<p>He says that he doesn't feel anything, be it love, emotions, or anything. He says that he hasn't loved anyone in the past 10 years except his straight crush who was his classmate in college. He is 30 now and his sex drive is way too low. I told him that I love him and want to be with him several times, but he hasn't responded back saying I love you ever. It has been 4+ months that we have been together now and both of us have stopped going to planetromeo ever since we met for the first time. I call him rocky for his rock hard and cold feelings. A week without meeting feels like a month. He says that I'm overthinking, but that's the way I am. I can't stop thinking about him. He is the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and last thing when I sleep at night.
He says that he doesn't want to live in India, he despises India and the LGBT oppressor fucking BJP every now and then. But I do not want to leave India, my parents and friends
I don't understand what to do. I've GRE on Jun3, I want to do PhD in Cryptography but I am not able to study at all. I don't want to leave him, but I don't want to stay with him this way for a lifetime either because he is cold blooded creature. What shall I do :(</p>
<h1>GCI- Do what benefits you. He has those particular set of feelings, you have those particular set of feelings which are not getting responded. You are thinking a bit too much on this. I don't blame you as I know how it feels when your feelings are not returned in the same magnitude. But you have to see what's good for you. If you want to make a career, go for it. Don't be like, "Oh I will give things up for him." Trust me, you will regret it later and hate him for it.</h1>
