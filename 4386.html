<p>I m 24 n i love making ppl smile. For me GAY means being happy and nothing else.
There was my friend with whom i had always been happy. During my college days, he told me that he loves me. I was like : "wtf" n i didnt talk 2 him for months. eventually during our last year we started talking. But since then he never talked 2 me n i hab lost all his contact.
At this juncture of life, i m missing him. I want 2 b happy with him. I did hurt him as i failed 2 understand his feelings. So i m searching him visiting gay rooms n ids through fb n other mediums.
I hab no idea if this qualifies me as Gay but i hav no regret if He comes back in my life if i become gay.
Once again..Gay means being happy n spreading love n smile. It is above all cliches n categorization.
admin, i hab lost him...</p>
