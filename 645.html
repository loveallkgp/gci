<h1>Viv- My my i would have lost a few brain cells but anyways, No one has the right to hurt you. You get hurt because you have already victimized yourself beyond limits. Get an effing grip on yourself man. Self pitying is never an answer. You will just be a looser this way. Be hard on your self. Rather detest your pitying nature and you will be good to go.</h1>
