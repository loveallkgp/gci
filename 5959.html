<p>M in luv fortunately with a gay guy but unfortunately its 1sided
I proposed him on 31st dec n he denied may bcoz m litl fat nor may not b his typ then hum dost bane jhagda n friendships..........I still luv him But he don't knew k mene ajj taq usse friend k nazriye se dekha hi nhi.infact my luv has been increased
n wanna say to those people who say 1sided luv ends with Tym that k we hen we fall 4 some1 we must not expect the same.....dats y I decided to stay alone throughout my lyf as m very loyal to my luv!
Now he z on some difficult phase of his lyf 
He need moral support dats y m with him but its really hurting me a lot k everyday usse milna n uske sath hoke bhi na hona.I just wanna c him Happy that's y...
I was waiting 4 the day when he ll get a perfect match 4 him n tab me uski zindagi se chala jata.sometimes I really wanna kiss him lay on his arms............just need a tight hug n then I wanna cry on his arms......WO mere sath kavi kavi tora ajeeb type behave krta hai lyk he don't allow me to come closer to him even I don't wanna go closer but usse esa na lage k me pretend ker raha hu islye me normal friends type.............but sometimes I feel uses v pata hai k me usse pyar.................
But wo mujhe friend manta hai n he use to share every his problems with me n he wanted me to the same.....I wish I could....but I can't bcoz i knew k me agr apni pareshani uske samne rakhunga toh mujhe daar hai k mere muh se fir se i luv u na nikal jaye n kel coincidencly usne mere dusre confession padh liye n was forcing me to share everything...... M just scared my tears ll not fall in front of him.yar mere andar bahut paak ra hai........kvi kvi rote rote mera dil bahut bhari ho jata hai n suddenly block ho ja ta hai n me move nhi ker pata hu
I just hope mere kuch life k dreams pure hone se pehle mujhe kuch na ho
I was wondering k if he ll get Mr perfect n I ll fulfill my dreams (sucessful actor ban jau)then I would got bliss...but yesterday he was saying he don't need any partner.....I was lyk damnn......huh! 
Its gonna b damn difficult to convince him that he can't stay alone throughout lyf 
Yar mujhe toh uske mom dad se v kvi kvi jealous fell hota he k wo unke sath q rehta he...lol
Then u can think mere liye ye kitta difficult hone wala hai k me usse convince Karu k kisi ko date kerne ko.......he z mentally disturbed now a days about his sexuality his lyf n his past relationships
Mujhe internally strong hona hai yar! But kese.....?</p>
<h1>GCI- I lost u after u wrote PAAK RHA HAI....</h1>
<p>Ok u want to be strong internally then remember this-</p>
