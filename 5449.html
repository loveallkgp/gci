<p>Yes m a victim of child molestation. Yes Yes Yes. I was 11.. He was a relative of our landlord. There was very shortage of electricity in Delhi during those days.He did it many times. Its a black chapter of my life. Seriously its a painful part. I feel shamed...i didnt raise my voice....i dont know why....Life goes on. I completed my education. Now m working...but Ohh God ...wo scene nahi jaate dimaag se....disturbance...disturbance.....disturbance...few days ago..on the right panel of Facebok " friends you may know" showed his pic..now he is married... he has two son...He is living a peaceful life. I was trying to coming out...but no...it gives me pain in my soul and will remain till my end. M living a very busy life...but we are not busy during whole day....he did wrong..but m suffering..why he did this.. ..it is very painful to remember those past days....I have so much ambition left...i wanna forget...but i cant..There is no cure...why</p>
<h1>GCI- I am sorry buddy. It really feels bad to know that someone can abuse a child. To feel yourself okay with it you just have to take the step yourself. You have to speak to yourself in the mirror "Yes, I was abused. It's his fault, not mine. I will come out of it and I will be brave." You can't let an incident make your life troubling.</h1>
