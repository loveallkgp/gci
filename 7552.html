<p>hi everyone, I am 24 from Pune. I came to this city two years ago with high hopes and aspirations, both personal and professional. I was aware of my cravings so I rented a flat alone. I met dozens of people here, some of them I really liked and even they liked me back. I always wanted a relationship for myself, but when I come near it, I chicken out. I am not able to put that much time and effort, like talking and texting everyday. I don't like wasting my time like that. I have never fallen in love with anyone as they show in the movies. I don't know if true love exists, should I wait for the right guy or should I go ahead and be with someone, after all relationships are all about compromises.</p>
<h1>GCI- Wait for the right guy? Your right guy may have come to you, you slept with him and closed the window after it was done.</h1>
<p>You yourself said that you don't want to put time and effort in talking and texting everyday. How do you expect to have a relationship then, Mr. Genius? Relationships are hard to maintain, and if you don't have the capability to go in one, then don't try to be in one. If you do want to be in a relationship, you have to make an effort, otherwise you will just be a whining guy and blaming it on the world.</p>
