<p>Here goes my confession</p>
<p>I am from kerala amd i am a gay guy. I'm an engineering student and while in 2nd semester one msg came into my cell saying that he knews abt me and want to b frnds and to check my fb. I never told any one i'm gay nd never shared my real ID nd my phone numbr. So i got frightened. Nd checked my fb there was a request from an unknown guy which s ofcourse a fake id. So i deleted that request nd blocked it. Aftr some time i got another request which is frm a real id saying that he s the same person who msgd me. I accepted that bcoz he looked realy hot :-P . wt else to do...</p>
<p>Aftr 4 months of chatting we decided to meet. I was really shy nd i was afraid of meeting unknown persons frm fb. Aftr lots of thinking i met him in a theatre. We talked and he seem to b a nice guy. So we continued our chatting nd he insisted me to send my nude pics to him. As it was my frst i did so. But he never send me his. So i did not send anymore pics to him. But he keeps saying to send pics nd hav sex with him in a hotel room. I was clearly not ready fr all that and so i stopped meeting him nd blockd him nd stopped chatting.</p>
<p>Aftr that i came close with a cute guy who s very understanding nd never pressurized me to anything. He said he wants to take things slow nd i like that. I really like him nd we never had sex till nw.</p>
<p>My problm is that the frst guy is now back from abudaabhi nd blackmailing me to hav sex with him showing the nude pics of mee.. i am soo frightened nd never told anything to my new bf. I dnt knw wt to do. He s actually black mailing me. Saying that if i dont hav sex with him , he will post my pics on my fb wall.. wt to do?</p>
<h1>GCI- First thing- Talk about this with your guy. It would be better if he hear it from you. It won't be a surprise for him as most of the gays do it all the time. Most of us has a past.</h1>
<p>Second- Take proofs of the harassing messages that the guy is sending like screenshots, and whatever type of texting you had with him. As per fb rules, he cannot post naked pictures on his news feeds or on anybody's wall. Nudity is not allowed. You can report him on FB too. </p>
<p>Third- You can block his ass on fb too. Threaten him that you got proof with his identity against him and you will either post the pics on his profile or you can directly go to the cyber cell and file a formal complaint.</p>
