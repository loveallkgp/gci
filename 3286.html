<p>I am a normal guy..I have strong hold in my goals and dreams.. I'd like to travel. Don't have any intention to save large assets. Also am from a middle class family. Now am 24 the nagging age for marriage from others obviously. I like girls but I never been with one and now I don't want to be. I reached my puberty with straight porn. And I was happy with that... Recently 2 years back I had some connection with a guy and we hit it off instantly. My 1st sex and its with a guy... we we're going steady for a year and a half and we split up. (Before when I was in college I let a guy touch me and jerk me off) Now I can't go back... I don't feel anything for a girl... but when I see a guy of my taste my heart jumps... I thought I was bisexual I expiremented with straight porn after that but my turn on is only when the guy appears on the screen. Then everything goes as usual. I don't know really what to do. I don't wanna spoil my life and the girl's. Now my parents are forcing me to get married. I don't want to. Am planning to talk to my dad about my sexually. And am an Indian.</p>
