<p>I haven't ever tried confessions before. I guess I always thought they were unnecessary but I'm bored and right now it does seem interesting. Its less of a confession and more of me venting out my thoughts.</p>
<p>First off, I'm new to the gay circle/community of India. I'm pretty much inside the closed (only close friends know) and living in a small town doesn't help at all, what with all the people here who have no idea of the various sexualities. Coming out here would be stupid. Bigger cities on the other hand are much more aware in comparison, but I'm nowhere near to living there.</p>
<p>I never really gave it much thought, that I could use social networks to connect to people of the gay community; I never needed to connect at all. Tonight is actually the first time that I'm trying to explore the Indian gay community thats on facebook.</p>
<p>Agreeing with confession #2388, all I see is people asking for sex. If not sex then, well what else? Information about your dick size and whether you're a top or bottom. Thats just too sad to see. No I'm not asking about how to deal with it.</p>
<p>I'm just raising a concern since I'm a newbie (treat me like a newbie, thanks). Is a huge part of the community really that sloppily repulsive? Sure there are good people out there too but I don't really know where to step. Its a walk in the dark right now because I don't know anyone else who's either gay or lesbo or etc, I didn't need a fellow gay till now. I feel like a retard now.</p>
<p>I don't know what I'm trying to ask right now. Maybe some insight on where do I step. Maybe words of wisdom in the lines of - "whatever the fuck you wrote bro."</p>
<p>End of vent</p>
