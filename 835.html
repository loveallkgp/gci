<p>I am 29 and he is 25. I had a recent break after 4 month relation. We live in diff cities. First time we met for 3 days it's awesome feeling both love and sex. Second time we spent a week and we had few fights... Finally we are good. We always love each other but I love more than him. He always says that too. To be honest he is not good at sex but I love him so much. If he is in my arms I forget all my sparrows.</p>
<p>One fine day He broke relation because he wants to stop sex with guys, this happened over night. He just want me as a friend and not a boy friend any more. I can't forget him and I still need him.. After this break up other approached me but I didn't have interest to proceed with the new guy.</p>
<p>Any idea why what happened to my ex bf. He left me badly and I loved him like a father and care him more like brother... I am hopeless now.... Don't know why that stupid left me?? Any idea </p>
<h1>Viv- He wanted to stop sex with guys. Maybe his family is pressurizing him for marriage with a girl. But its real bad that you had to go through this. Seems a bit like my story. :(</h1>
