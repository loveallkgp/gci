<p>Not sure what situation am in. first, I saw him on my friend's facebook pics. he looked extremely smart and hot (even now). I hardly knew him then. But, when I first met him I realized how sweet he is. Multi-talented. extremely smart. adventurous.very social. extremely caring. living life to the fullest. I thought I would fall for him. but, I live in an extremely conventional society. though he likes me, he never accepted that himself. I never expressed my likeness too. the fear of falling for him, kept me away from him. I tried to avoid him. even though he visits our house every now and then. the last few months when things are coming to an end(read it my marriage), I realized how stupid I was. I could have atleast be with him. I could have atleast enjoyed his company. shared stories and happiness. He could have been my friend. And, there he was in the least few months, still supporting me when everyone else left me. he IS a good friend. If things were different, we could have lived together. but, in this life, you being my friend is the biggest gift of my life. I wish this friendship stays for eternity. I love you, my friend. Yes, as my dearest friend. And, I want you to be in touch with me always. I will never make that mistake again.</p>
