<p>There was a news item in times about Zimbabwe president speaking at UN about how gays are worse than pigs and he will continue to hang them. I was reading the comments section and was shocked about the level of gay hatred of Indians. Out of 700 comments almost all were bad. They were supporting the guy and asking why Modi wasn't like him. Many wanted 377 to be enhanced to death penalty. Some wanted gays to be put in mental institution or jail. If the so called educated public feels this way I don't know what hope we have.</p>
<h1>GCI- Lets not try to care about internet warriors who say overly stretched stuff like this. There are plenty of people who support our cause. It's not acceptance that we seek but respect and equal status. We shall have it either way even if the naysayers speak out really loud.</h1>
