in 2011 i was in a relationship wit a guy. i jus to f*<em>k him bare.. for almost 2years i did it... never used a protection as he never liked it... after breaking up with him, i fucked 3 more guys again without protection. but it happend only twice wit each guy or so..
now i m in relationship with a guy n from last 6months i m fu</em>king him bare.. like almost 3-4 times a week or so...
this is going serious coz if i use condom i dont get proper erection. also my guy dont like it with condom. 
p.s : top secret. we are in an open relationship so i m fucking a guy bare ,who was straight n now turned gay bottom. n i can assure that i m only his sexual partner. he dont go to anyone fr sex or meet ups... </p>
<p>plz help me guys plzz plz 
i want serious suggestions plz.
dont simply be rude to me... plz</p>
<h1>GCI- Let me ask you one thing. What is more important to you? Your momentarily pleasure or a lifetime of diseases? I don't care how many guys you fuck or whatever, your main concern should be your health. HIV is not the only risk to your health. There are plenty of other diseases that can be spread by having unprotected sex. Use a condom even if your dick stops to perform and you become a bottom (I still hate this word).</h1>
