<p>Hello everyone, I'm very much depressed these days dont know what to do, I'm working in IT sector as Testing Engineer since last 3.5 years, my job is going nowhere no growth no onsite opportunities. Even I am also not at all interested in this job, I'm always sad as being Gay is so tough in India, you cant share your feelings with someone, thats why I'm planing to move abroad, but not sure how to fulfill my dream. I'm thinking about doing Masters or MBA from Abroad so that it will be easy for me to get job there and then settlement. But the problem is investement as Im from middle class family, somehow I will manage around 10L but beyond that is too risky. So please, folks who are settle abroad or having any information about any courses(around 10 Lpa) that are good to do in Abroad &amp; little bit job prospects will be there, I am not aiming for higher packages but some job prospects will be there its not like they will send me India again. I'm preparing for GMAT &amp; thinking for applying in Canada or Europe. SO please someone suggest some courses will be beneficial. This is the only hope I have left in my life now!</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, even if you want to go out of India, I'd suggest to go for a diploma first, and not for a professional course, as it will cost you very less. Plus, you will get your diploma easily and can apply for residency very early. And once you are done with the residency thing, you can go for the higher education with reduced price and then you can apply for a job.</h1>
