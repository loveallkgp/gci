<p>hii  i had a brkup 10 mths agobich bich me hmari jst nrmal casually hi hello hoti rhi i never approached him ki wo mjhse bat kre ...
2 times he asked me for m,y num i gave him and once he called me to mera mood bhi khrb tha to i called him thn uske bad again he asked me fr my number i gave him bt he never called me...
even tht after brkup he called me i love u when we r talking in the market with each other
most of the time i saw him he was busy on his phone in talking .
he broked up with me and abused me a lot during brkup
thnk last friday i was coming from the local market near by my house then he asked me for my num i refused to give hi by saying "ab kya kehna hai abhi bhi kuch kehna baaki reh rha hai to he said ki maine ab kuch kaha hai tjhe " thn i said tu bol pehle kya bolna hia tjhe thn uske cuzn aagye he said kiuske cuzn aagye hia bad me bat krte hia 
thn aftr tht i asked him ki wt r u saying tht day to he said pplz are there i talk u later 
thn afetr 2-3 days i saw him bt dnt knw what happens to me whnevr i saw him my heartbeats fast and some time it skips ...... 
 when i saw him he is standing in the market thn i run to catch him from another street thn after tht he saw me and ignored me..dnt knw why i want his attention towards me..
plz tell me admin &amp; guyz what tto do i feel like hellllllll .... jiske wajah se i cant concentrate upon my career.....</p>
