<p>I asked him to meet my best mate (kinda my fag hag, who is a colleague of mine), but he bluntly refused to, several times.
He lives alone and uske best friends came to visit him. I was damn excited to meet them and I planned to stay with them overnight. We were planning it for almost 2 weeks. I was supposed to go to my friend's brother's wedding on that day and then go to his home after the marriage, ghar pe bahana bana ke, k mai saari raat wedding me hi rahunga.
But on that day he all of a sudden switched plan and went to some get together of some old friends. I waited an hour, for him to come back even after all the other colleagues of mine had left from the wedding party. Finally I decided to move back home around 1am. Still trying to get over this incident even though I know that I'm over thinking/overreacting. My desire to meet his friends almost faded off. Then I thought again to forget this and went to his home to meet him and his friends. He is out to his friends and they know that we are seeing each other. I visited him and to my surprise two of his other friends whom he is not out... knocked the door. I secluded myself to a room and then embarrassed left after sometime, saying that I'm feeling drowsy and must get home. Now I have no desire left to meet his friends and our relationship has entered a complicated stage :'(</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmm..we dear...if I m to say anything here i will put it into facts...</h1>
<p>1- The issue of bf's friends must not be an issue at all..if u like them good..if not..just avoid them politely..
2- Ur relationship must not be based on how many  people are you having in your life....rather how happy u r with them...and who are the gems.....its not possible always for our partner to share the same depth that we form with our besties!
3- U must remember that friends are the reason that we remain motivated and count on in times of our hardships(if they are our soulmates) ..our partner is our lifemate as well as our soulmate..this is the DIFFERENCE!
4- U must not complicate those things which needs to be handled maturedly and gently..bcoz once u force ur partner to like your friends u end up creating distances and vice versa goes for u also..</p>
