<p>yesterday night is still in my mind....yesterday i was looking for some hookups..then suddenly a man came to that place, in first sight he was looking very handsome and he was a NRI..then i went to his layne and made an eye contact with him..luckily he was also interested ..then we had a good conversation and an awsome oral sex ..he had an amazing magnetic nature and personality, i wanted to pause that movement forever when we were together , then we started talk abt relation past and everything, then suddenly i dont know how he came to know that i want to make a relation with him...probably i might gave him some hint so he knew already. then after sone time he said to me pardesi k sath dil mat lagana..when i heard those lines i got numb ... then we had a little more talk and but this doesnt made me enjoy it was it was like a torment then i said i am getting late i need to go , then i left tht place and went to home and after 15 minutes again i went to that place i dont know what i was hoping but definetly i wanted to see him last time but he was not there . I waited there till half an hour for him but he didnt come. till now i am waiting for him ... 1 day i will meet him in this hope.....</p>
