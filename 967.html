<p>Hey Confessors,</p>
<p>I am not really good in confessions, as i am a private person i talk very less about my life. But looking at this page i thought i should try.</p>
<p>I am 23 now, i got into relationship very early in my teens everything was going good, we were having wonderful time. But then came break up and i was shattered. I went into this shell, which i still find hard to come out from. Break up changed my personality, i became shy and introvert person and started neglecting myself, became lazy ass. I also had couple of rebound relationships but then i was looking for my Ex in them, which didnt work out.</p>
<p>Its not just a confession, i want others specially teens on this page to understand that dont be an emotional fool spend your teens building yourself and your career take me as lesson i am still broken.</p>
<h1>Viv Good suggestion but even a delicate little baby bird has the strength to crack open its eggshell to come out and breathe. Why don't you try that?</h1>
