<p>hii admin..:) 
yOu are doing a great job man..
you comments are just wow...
here kindly comment on my situation too..
I was not a gay earlier...once during a class my friend told me to touch his dick..
we were in 9th standard I guess...
and soo..I dnt knew much about gay world and all...I did what he said...
touching his dick was everydays chore..
I started liking it too...
once there was no one at his home...
soo he invited me...
and we had fun..
no sex just fore play and sort off...
I really loved that thing..
I tried it with my another friend..
he too enjoyed it..
I was on cloud 9 with all this going on in my life..
but then 10th boards and 11th stream made all of us apart..
now..
both of them say that they don't have time for all this...
I dnt know what too do...
I tried to convince them both that please be with me..
I am not a sort of sex seeker..
but I too want sexual pleasure..
I just need them to know how it feels to b alone..
they made me what I am today and now they are no where Even closer...
admin please tell me what should I do..
I am afraid of meeting someone els too..coz I never met ...
thnq for posting admin..:)

<p>$ABBY : darling nobody made you  gay . when he told you to touch his dick if you were straight guy you would have said ' NO ' . 
 i have touched law books so many times that didn't make me lawyer . </p>
<p>just find yourself ... and don't be afraid of who you are , just accept it .</p>
