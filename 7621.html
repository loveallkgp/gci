<p>well i am not a gay but i am a crossdresser and feel proud of it...when i was near about 7 years old i wore bangles and i applied lipstick on my lips..i had no idea what i was doing but then i forgot everything about this..time passed by and i behaved like a normal boy with no inch of crossdressing inside me but till that one day i met a girl (aliya)..everything changed from then.i had a real relationship with her..i loved her and i was serious about her..but i guess i was not lucky to get her even aftr so much dedication,she ditched me and i was broken.i tried to end my life..i wanted to destroy myself.. i beat myself,cut my hands and torcher myslef in all the possible ways..but then one day i thought ending life and torchering self is not solution..so i thought that why not i strt crossdressing and bring some shame to my manliness..so i incepted crossdresing...for the first few months i hated it..but after when i dressd fully like a girl with makeup i felt tht being a girl is awesome and now i dont regret of being a crossdresser at all..i feel that dressing up in a cute dress,chatting with boys,walking like a girl.talking in a girly way is really really cool..and i am hoping to carry out this decision and change my gender..and do it like a girl...</p>
<h1>GCIL- Looks like someone got inspired by Gaurav arora from Splitsvilla...more power to u from our side..</h1>
<p>P.S- Do it if u really are able to carry that for an entire lifetime. Sit with urself  to take a stand and introspect and never regret of whatever the outcome may be. Goodluck my gal!</p>
<p>P.P.S- Its torturing and DARE U ATTEMPT SUICIDE again....ur id shall be reported by us to the police if u repeat and then come here to write about ur suicide shit.</p>
