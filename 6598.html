<p>Hi I am a 23 year old engineer, doing quite well and very satisfied with life. I am having a mental condition I am not sure if anyone else has ever gone through. I think I am a bi gendered homosexual, that is to say that I am comfortable with my biological gender but sometimes I want to be a girl. I even have dreams where I am a girl. I was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder when I was 15, but through a lot of counselling and CBT I started feeling comfortable with my body. Now I regularly go to the gym and have a toned body which I like to flaunt very much. The guys I meet also find me very desirable. All in all I am very happy with what I have, but still sometimes I feel I would have been more comfortable had I been a girl. Has anyone else ever experienced such a thing?</p>
<h1>GCI- GID or gender dysphoria were used ages ago for people who thought their gender and sex did not match. People who feel like they are born in the wrong biological sex, come under the umbrella term of transgender. However, your case is more similar to the term being 'gender fluid'. Being a bigender or being gender fluid does come under transgender category as well, and these are outside gender binary and cisnormativity. There are many people who feel like that, they just have to explore themselves.</h1>
