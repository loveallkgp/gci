<p>I was in love with one guy last year but I broke off with him since I found a handsome top and also I dont want to waste my life with one guy only. But hes become a big chipku. He keeps calling and crying asking to restart our relation. I had sex with him two times after breakup mainly because I was scared he might suicide. But afterwards I abused him lot and even hit him but he's not leaving me alone. Please help me how to block him from my life.</p>
<h1>GCIL- IT is because of guys like u polyandry is shamed in broad day light because u mix shallow emotions in that in-built psyche.</h1>
<p>Just reverse the situation and then try to feel how would u like to be called a drag and a drama queen because u really like someone?!
Some people are chipku because they don't have anyone to hold on and do not leave a person that easily because they are really lonely and guys like u destroy people like those because u don't know how to choose or mate.</p>
<p>P.S- That guy is hurt and when he will get over you, this will finish....next time do not fool anyone in the name of relationship of so called love...coz u people really don't know what it means....
