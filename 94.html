<p>Ok i am a 19 yr old girl 
My confession is that gays are really really really adorable !! I mean  literally there were instances where i wished that i were a guy so that i could be with the gays 
I have a gay friend and he is sweet tooo and i even had a crush on him but well he liked my brother (uff wo heartache lol ) and i tild him that i like him and he was like .... "i cant ... not a girl " 
I cried a lot back then but then i got over it coz uski koi galti ni thi .... we are really good friends now though 
You would be wondering why i am confesssing this but kya karu !! Ladki hu .. baat chipti nai  hai :D kisi se to batana hi tha isliye yaha confess kra</p>
<h1>AdminViv- You go girl! I was having a continuous smile while reading your text. Why? Because i have a female best friend too who knows about me and she too feel like this for me. I think the friendship of a girl and a gay guy is just magnificently awesome! Hugs! :)</h1>
