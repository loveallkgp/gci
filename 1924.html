<p>guys being top / bottom / versatile is not just about being sucked or sucking someone but .these are interest over which a relationship is based up on</p>
<p>To all you guys down there who still don't know what's the difference between :- TOPS &amp; BOTTOMS &amp; VERSATILE ....</p>
<p>TOP :- Tops are those who are more protective , possessive , Morrison active and play a role of a man in relationship ... they are the family runners in a " typical relationship family " term .... they are more dominating + active in relationship ......</p>
<p>BOTTOMS :- Bottoms are those . Who are a bit softer , sophisticated , less aggressively active ... they believe in being behind their man .. as they enjoy being protected ... they enjoy being possessed and owned by their man ... they play a role of a woman in relationship in a " typical relationship family " term .... there are pretty few . To stand against the motion as they stand a bit feminine .... at times ..
VERSATILE :- versatile are those who play both as tops mad bottoms ...</p>
<p>Guys sex is not just a single thing these questions make sense for .. but even in relationship it matters . . As they differ according to their interest .....</p>
<h1>GCI- Hold the eff up! Who says that passives are the "women" in relationship and actives are the "men" in relationship? It varies from person to person. I have seen the so called tops who are worse than being soft and a total drama QUEENS and I have seen so called bottoms who can kick some serious ass. Calling tops as men and bottoms as women is just a stereotype that straights ask gay people like "Who is the man and who is the woman in a gay couple?" Get your head right buddy.</h1>
