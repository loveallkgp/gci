<p>I am a bisexual. There are many posts here attacking bi for being disloyal. First of all get this into your thick heads. Bi's can relate more to straight community than the LGT community. We mostly date girls and hang out with straight men. There is nothing wrong in being intimate with men and finally marrying a girl. We can keep the girl happy in every way. It is gays who cannot, yet almost all of them choose to get married. It is they who are disloyal and hypocrites. So please introspect next time before abusing bisexuals.</p>
<h1>GCI- From where is fucking nonsensical talks are coming? Are we really trying to fit in the so called heteronormative society? Are we really trying to sabotage the fellow LGBT people because some of them cannot understand? There is something called calming down and teaching the stuff which others don't know. But no! This is the problem with us Indians that if anyone says a something negative, it hurts our egos so bad that we fight tooth and nail to put that person down. Next time try to educate. Angry words are not a sign of an educated person. There is a fine line between being literate and being educated. Be an educated one along with being literate.</h1>
