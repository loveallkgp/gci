<p>Hello admin
It's my second confession here. Last time i wrote about my straight best friend and how I've been in love with him.
After many thoughts and considerations I've decided to move on and date someone....or at least befriend someone of my type.
I've had chat with many guys on facebook, but I never felt spark for anyone. I always seem to compare the guys with my best friend. I don't know if it is because of some feeling still retained for my best friend or maybe I like people like him.
I've talked to some guys here and at the beginning of every conversation they ask me, if I am top or bottom. No one ever asked me what I like or what is the ambition of my life.
Well I am 21 yr. old, I like reading novels and watching movies like Shawshank's Redemption and Forest Gump. I am more of an intellectual and philosophical kind of person.
I think I need a friend, who would be interested in coming to my place for having a look at the paintings that I've made or for watching some stupid movie together, and not asking me if I've a place available for sex or not.
I can also be a pen-friend, if someone interested in having friendship with me.
Admin, can you help me with that...btw I live in Jodhpur.</p>
<p>Thank You
:)</p>
<h1>Viv- A baggage of talent you are.. damn! LOL... But you know what, for friendship the person has to comparable to your thinking and not to your crush. Have a good time searching for one. :)</h1>
