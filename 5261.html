<h1>GCI- Do not do anything with him. He is gay and he knows it yet he tries to hide it and he didn't come to help you when you needed him the most. Maintain some distance and if he tries to do anything, just face him tell him that you are not interested. Hot or not, your self esteem should not depend upon someone else' looks.</h1>
