<p>This is about my friend's life.
He was in a relationship with a guy for 2 years, so that guy wanted to become a actor and he attented acting academy, it was his dream and after majoring in acting (i guess he was also studying BA in drama), he started giving auditions so some agency can select him and give him training and sponsor him. chances were less because around 800-900 people come to mumbai everyday to find such opportunities. My friend encouraged that guy, judged his acting and a year ago he won in some audition for supporting role in a movie(but it had less time duration) and he got several small roles like this, finally he was selected by agency which gave him training and sponsored him and now he is going to play a supporting role in a movie, but he left my friend, he said that if he continued to be in relationship with him, he wouldn't acheive his dream and he didn't want his fans to know about his homosexuality. Soo sad...well that movie is set to release in october in which he is going to play a supporting role. Don't go to watch any movies which will release in october.
:-P</p>
<h1>GCI- Damn! He is just making a sorry excuse. In the showbiz you gots to get sweaty with aahhh aahhh's and oooh oohhhh's to get something good. Very few get on the big roles with pure talent or if they have a godfather in the industry. The ultimate thing would be that everyone might know about his homosexuality.</h1>
