<p>Hello Guys,
Most of you guys are so smart and intelligent. I really want to thank all of you especially GCI Admin about an earlier confession I posted here.
I have a bf from the last 4 years. He is very close to his family. He want to keep his relationship with me as well as his family. I respect that. But sometimes he keeps me at bay just to be with his family. It annoys me a lot. I still give him space because I know exactly before entering into this relationship what I am signing up for. But now I am wondering if the things are going to stay like this forever? That would be too much for me. He hails from quite traditional Punjabi family. He said he will come out. It's been 4 years and there's no progress in this regard. I am thinking of moving abroad to States probably. But without him it's not possible. My life is centered around him. Can you guys advise me soemthing as what to do? And secondly, if you guys can share some info about coming out to your parents would be helpful.
Thanks</p>
<h1>GCI- You know what couples should do if they are together since such a long time? Plan future together. There are times when you should sit and talk like mature men and plan the things you want to do which includes coming out as well. Ask him what he wants and where does he see himself in the next 5 years. You really have to be with each other if you want to come out. You both have to make your parents believe that being with each other is what makes you happy. Have a talk with him and see where it goes.</h1>
