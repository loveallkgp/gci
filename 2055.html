<p>Hello to All.:)
My ConfesSion..
I Have a cousin.. Umm.. we r close to each other.. He is a year older to me.. N lives nearby..
Sometimes I doubt..and I feel He is gay too.. N he ia havin a relationship kinda thing with hjs RoOmiEwho is also his claSSmate! in his college.(I am18. and he is19..pursuin engg.)
Reasons of my doubt:
1.When we were young at the ageof 9-10.. we use to get intimate a lot.. kissing.. hugging.. biting each other..(P.S. we met only during our summet vavcations since he then lived in another city).but after grade 7 we stopped meeting. due to pur studies in our respective cities.
2.Every Now n then wen we r together he kisses me.. n sleeps wid me hugging me tight even now!
3.He couldn't live a second without his roomie wherever he goes he takes on his roomie..even at relative's places too!!
4.At his room when i did sleepover.. I saw.. His roomie n him.biting each other.. kissing on the body(i acted as if i was asleep) n wen in mornin i woke i saw thm sleeping in a position i think no two str8 guyz cud sleep!! no matter how close r they!!
5.A few days back his roomie shifted to another place nearby my cousin's old room.due to roomir's bro who came to live with him now.. they both were literally crYing! My cousin didnt even eat his food!!</p>
<p>Guyz.. Tell me. Am i right or wrong in my doubts????
I fell awkward now..going jnfront of both of them cousin n his roomie.. Em Gay.. but I dont like the way they behavein front of me!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Ooh la la! Maybe they both were in a relationship. You never know. And you are not wrong in your doubts. He is definitely gay.</h1>
