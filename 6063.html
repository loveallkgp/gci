<p>This question is for the doctors in this page n the admin......
  " I have seen anal sex in porns only, does it exist in real ???? I mean is it purely biological...... Vagina is ment for insertion of penis, no doubt but i dont think our anus is ment for this purpose !!! It may cause some severe injury in the rectum or the tissues, isnt it ????? "</p>
<h1>confused</h1>
<p>n those who had done anal sex , arnt you getting any problem with your ass ;) ??????</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay honey boo boo, listen up closely. If you have seen anal sex in porn, then it does exist in real. Like duuhhh.</h1>
<p>Until and unless you try it yourself, you cannot get out of your beliefs. The fact is that the anal walls are full of nerve ending and can give the sensation of pleasure when stimulated. Moreover with guys, the prostate gland plays a big role in anal sex. If it is stimulated through the anus, you can have an orgasm without penile stimulation. There prostate massages in which people receive them from professional.</p>
<p>It is also true that anal walls are not as elastic as vaginal walls, that is why people who are on the receiving end, take special care. And if any injury is bound to happen, it can happen with vagina as well.</p>
