<p>I was in a local train yesterday and one uncle and a young guy were also traveling. They seemed to be office colleagues. Uncle was reading paper movie ad and asks in yeh movie Aligarh kya hai? Young guy whispers its about guud(hindi slang for gay) people. Uncle appears shocked and says they started making movies on such people too. What do they show in such movie? Young guy says aur kya Gand marwane ke scene honge. Both laugh loudly. Even nearby people who overhead are laughing. Then he say bechara Manoj bajpayee accha actor tha. Paise ke liye kya kya karna pad raha hai.
The whole thing made me realize that straight people always just view us as butt fucking despos and being gay is a big tragedy.</p>
<h1>GCI- The insensitive people are insensitive for a reason and that mainly is ignorance and narcissist attitude towards the lesser known facts and realities.</h1>
<p>Next time u come across such people.....tell them that one of them might be in ur home.</p>
