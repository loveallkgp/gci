<p>I am 22 years old.i had sex at age of 14 .and after that with a friend of mine. Who was very much attracted towards me.than i started liking men which were very much handsome .i made this id to know about me ..to discover me.aftr making id i met 3-4 persons casually..but i resisted for sex.i dont know the reason maybe the bcoz of sexual harrasement by an uncle in my childhood..i was introvert .and couldn't tell my parents.i used to run away from him.every time.
Nw i feel lonely and need a handsome guy friend to talk n a bit kiss n hug..m a bit aatracted towards girls too.. i dont accept girls so much as boys.i am been proposed by 6girls last year.. i am a confused person .and i think a psycho too....</p>
<h1>GCI- That's not your psycho nature. That's a general human behavior. You just have to feel more confident about yourself and start working on socializing. I am sorry that you had that horrible past in your life but you cannot victimize yourself because of it. Things happen, they affect your life and you learn a lesson from them. You can never never ever let them put yourself down.</h1>
