<p>living with Devathoodan &lt;3
(devqthoodan - saviour male Angel )</p>
<p>all this hqppened.. happening still...</p>
<p>Contacted him through couch surfing, He received me at night, met in a gay bar, spoke, he was happy to get a gift from me, the night was cold and windy, made tea for me, said the tea came from his grand mother and its very healthy, was wonderful for a cold night. Tall and handsome, Beautiful face ( read : very beautiful, divine ) child like, very simple heart, child like smile. yes, started with a massage and ended with a "happy" ending. He is elder to me. lots of kisses, ( coz it is France you see :P )  We spoke a lot.</p>
<p>In an october weekend in 6th floor bilding in a very historic plqce , wind is cold, he is cooking for you and in the back mild french classical songs are being played, you both eat along with cheese and olives in his warm, house... fairy tale indeed ...
Woah Woah.. life.</p>
<p>Am living my life here.. seriouslw wish, this should go further.. stealing his pics now.
My saviour has come I think ??</p>
