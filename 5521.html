<p>I'm a feminine guy..feminine gay guy actually!
You know what guys..whenever I see any discussion on feminine guys on this page, it makes me laugh. Seriously! What hypocrite, superficial and ignorant people you are. You guys are worst than straight people.
I m pretty sure there are so many of u who were once feminine while growing up but due to constant nagging of others around u...u chose to change and pretend masculine. And guess what...u guys are the one who now pass the most disgusting comments on us.
What shocks me more is the fact that you guys are so much into discriminating feminine...I mean Jisko World ne accept nahi kiya..they need to understand ever our feelings...u people should know what we go through and YOU should be the FIRST one to hold our hands proudly and THEN ask for fuckin EQUALITY damnit. But guess what u do the exact opposite.
You so-called 'masculine' gays/bisexual people are the one who make me feel ashamed for belonging to the LGBTI community.
Ironically, LGBTI people talk of fighting for being accepted, but you masculine gay/bi guys need to first of all accept that THIS COMMUNITY ITSELF LACKS EQUALITY AND ACCEPTANCE !!! and you talk of being accepted?? Hahaha</p>
<p>P.S. I know abhi bhi most of the minds will be the same ignorant and hypocrite. <em>sigh</em></p>
<h1>GCI- Oh well, the truth has been spoken. Why we even blame heterosexual people when there is a problem in our community? From what I have noticed that heterosexuals who are our allies and have no problems with homosexuals, they are much more accepting than some people of our community. We have opinion, dramatic people, racism, color coding, rift between feminines and masculines, we first look at the person and judge.</h1>
<p>I once had a talk with a guy from facebook. I talked with him on cellphone and yeah, he was very girly. I didn't judge about it and we talked nicely. After a few days he put up an update on fb having a long list of demands to meet a guy and one of them was "No girly or feminines. I hate queens" I lost my mind and wrote, "Why this discrimination against feminines jab ki tu sabse badi aurat hai mere account me." Outcome? He blocked me after abusing me. </p>
<p>We are a lot more hypocrite than we imagine. We talk about equality and acceptance when we don't want to accept our own people.</p>
