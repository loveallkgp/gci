<h1>GCI- Hmm... he didn't ask for any suggestion or anything, but still I want to say something.</h1>
<p>You, confessor backed of because you were young and scared. He got engaged because he doesn't have the courage to be himself. He didn't get back to you or didn't even bother to contact you or whatever. And here you are, still feeling bad about it. One thing you can do is let him go and let him be busy in his life. You want to say things to him but he doesn't want to hear it. Come out of those feelings and live a better life.</p>
