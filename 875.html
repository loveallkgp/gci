But i also never wanna interfere him into my life, i want to make my dreams comes true so that's why i just want to make a long distance from anyone, please help me, i'm so numb with my life?</p>
<h1>Viv- The thing you want most in your life is your independence with a bit of adventure. If you have a bf, step back a bit but do not break up, and find yourself up. You really want to know yourself before making rest of the decisions in your life. But you cannot ever be alone. We have to socialize with one person or the other and we want that trusted someone with whom we can talk about our deepest feelings. You will only become frustrated if you distance yourself from everyone. So take a break, find yourself, and then continue your life.</h1>
