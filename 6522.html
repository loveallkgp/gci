<p>Hello admin. I was in love with a guy in office. It began slowly. He used to secretly check me out every time I was around. Sit near my table in cafe every day or press himself against me in lift. So I thought he was gay. Finally after a year of this I took a big risk and I talked to him. But he acted like he doesn't know me. Then after few days he himself came to me and said hes not "that type". He just has sex with men sometimes as a pure top. He also said he doesn't want any involvement with office guys. I was a lot depressed after that. I started avoiding him bcoz I wanted to get over him but he keeps trying to talk. He keeps saying nonsense like you must not love men. Women are for loving. Use men just for enjoyment. I don't like him now but if I fight, he could expose me in office. Feel so trapped.</p>
<h1>GCI- Nah doll, let me tell you. He is scared to accept his true reality. He is insecure about his identity and is trying to force it on you. He is inside that fake bubble of heterosexuality and he won't  come out. Best thing here would be to ignore him and if he comes to talk to you, just say, "I get it, fine. Stop it already. By saying this you are exposing yourself a bit too much and there are rumors about you." Trust me he will be on his toes after that.</h1>
