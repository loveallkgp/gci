<p>iam a b.tec 1st year student,18 year old.
in my life i had sex with boys and girls.but i never fucked girls or boys.I just had hugs,kiss,sucks ets with my 2 relative girls.same things happend with boys also.those was more than as with girls.few one tried to fuck me hard,but couldnt penetrate.how ever i dont know iam gay or not,iam intrestd in boys highly than girls.</p>
<p>Now i have a best friend in college.he is smart,white,slim,sexy.i love him very much.we are best frnds.we are just having a 9mntg frndship but strong.in the beginning i had no such feeling with him.but later i got such a feeling with him.in the class during luctures,we keep our hands together and play with fingers,some times i keep my hand on his lap,while we standing some where and talking he keep his hand in my shoulders and start to make moves with fingers over my neck.both of us will touch the ribs area.one day he
asked me are u touchng me wit such a feeling,i give a pale smile,he said dont tell abou my qstn to anybody.in computr lab we both are in same systm we hav to remove foot wears,from ther i keep my legs close to his,while toched we start play fingers of legs,we do same in clas when foot wears are removd.in elctrcl wrk shop when work is fnshd,we both stnd togetr and talk.whil talking he wil put his hand ovr my belly,strt to draw pictrs wit fingr.this wil lead to a typcal hug.our bnch mate wil say dnt behve like this,evry one wil thnk u are gays.</p>
<p>These are my rsns to think he has a crush with me.
wht u think?
iam fearful to ask hm,bcoz idont want to los him,if he has no crush wth me.</p>
<p>also he had 2 love relatns aftr wet met.he always keep in chat with them,he wil show me fb,watsap chts,seek my advce.now he has a strong relatn wit a girl,he wil tel al his problms with me,i wil give help to him and so on</p>
<h1>Viv- Well he surely wanna get laid with you as he is giving out clear signals to you but as he is trying to get serious with a girl, he may ignore you later on as it goes in most of the cases. Think wisely buddy and that too with your head which is on your shoulders.</h1>
