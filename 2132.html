<p>I know it has been asked a lot of times but still i wanna ask this.
May be the admin pin it.</p>
<p>I am a girly gay. NOT very girly in the utmost way but yes girly to SOME extent coz i have always enjoyed imagining myself as an traditional, Indian stylish woman.</p>
<p>But everyone knows that how homophobic this world is! Almost 98%! Even GAYS themselves dont like girlish ppl!</p>
<p>PLUS, I am a closeted gay!
So, my little girlishness triggers ppl to ask me about my love life. Now, you cant say the truth coz this is not the right age and stage in life!</p>
<p>And they mock you, insult you, criticise you, make you feel ashamed of your body language!</p>
<p>Sometimes, they just ask o say things which are outright DEMORALIZING or INSULTING!</p>
<p>So much so that, you may not like to face or talk to such ppl in future!</p>
<p>Thats y, i am getting alone! Suffering from Social Anxiety Disorder!</p>
<p>How can i remain confident about my sexuality and body-language?</p>
<p>And most importantly, how to behave with ppl like this when almost 97% r like that only. You can not break your ties with everyone. AFter all, human is a SOCIAL animal, one may need some1's help, one like sharing jokes etc.</p>
<p>But ppl maintain a distance from a girlish guy!
Dont make his their friend!</p>
<p>INSULT TOO.</p>
<p>How to maintain a HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP with such ppl because i dont want to fight?
ALSO, how to face such PUBLIC MOCKING or PUBLIC INSULT when you r a closeted gay?</p>
<h1>GCI- It is a long process but you have to start feeling confident about yourself. There will be people who will try to bring you down but you have to think that you are completely normal. Our culture has the vast explanations of male and female entities binding together. Those who cannot understand it, are the ignorant fools. Those who bully you, criticize you, insult you are the ones who think that being feminine is derogatory and being a male is okay in this world. And now you can think who is normal and who is abnormal. To having social contacts, you can just be yourself truly and say about yourself proudly. if some gay guy be like "girly gays stay away" you go like "guys who don't like girly gays stay the hell away." Make them taste their own dirt. And as far as public mocking or public insults are concerned, you just have to ignore them. Its is said that if you argue with someone stupid, then he will bring you down to his level and beat you with experience. You are definitely way better than those pseudo-humans.</h1>
