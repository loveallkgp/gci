<p>I wonder if this incident has happened to anybody else.
I came out from my original id on 11 dec 2013, there was various reactions but more were positive. Few appreciated me and some didn't react at all. That night my bestie texts up asking if i was a bisexual, i said yes. He started convincing me not to be so, dude look at your parents you cannot be so. How can you go around with a guy, i cannot imagine you being like that blah blah blah.
I had no answers for him as it is lame to make him understand what i was going through. 
Recently I updated my relationship status on FB in my original id.
Again he pings asks what's up with your relationship status, i denied.
he : dude is with a guy?
me: yes.
he: what is wrong with you bro, it is inappropriate.
me: i am cool with it.
he: what cool idiot?
me: so you will not accept me right?
he: it is very difficult dude.
me: wtf, so you will let go of me right?
after that no reply from him at all.
I dint even bother to text him up.
PS: Even best friends are betrayers.</p>
<p>$ABBY : its not called betrayal .. you mr .. lol do you even know what betrayal is. </p>
<p>give your friend some time.. let him understand it. its new thing to him and probably a shock . when we get a new cellphone or laptop doesn't it take us time to get familiar with it. just give time a little time. convince him that what your personal life is shouldn't affect their friendship.</p>
