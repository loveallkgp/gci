<p>hello guys. finally ready to make a confession here after reading through so many confessions over the years and yeah its a happy one. 
let me start by saying something about myself. i am a 24 years old bisexual guy, from southern part of gujarat, done with my studies for now, decent person by nature and looks. i felt i was different from me peers when i was in my 10th class. With friends talking about girls and stuff i was interested in that. and also i was interested in guys. This created a lot of confusion in my head. I was familiar with the term GAY but didnt knew the term BIXSEXUAL back then. so i didnt knew what was going inside me. it was a whole array of emotions running wild inside me. i was a nerd from always so i dropped it altogether till the exams. After came 11th and 12th standards. I was infatuated with this girl from our batch so i thought i was straight then. this took most of my school years. so i came out of school with a perception of being straight guy. it was in college when i discovered and came to accept the other part of me. staying in hostel with guys all around, roaming around in next to nothing clothes made me turn on a bit. so again the confusion started. I had my girl friend in the late 1st year of my engineering. so all though the 2 years i was having fun in my relationship and stuff. i didn't even pay attention to the gay part inside me. there was a other part of my life i haven't mentioned and this let me to start searching things online. I made a Facebook account and a planetromeo account and started looking around for guys. there was so much gay porn on the internet and i was having fun. i didnt meet anyone as i was a shy guy. just chatting and stuff. during this time i came across the term bisexuality. again, i was not ready to accept that anything as such exists. i finally hooked up with a guy near my pllace during my mid 3rd year of engineering. he was a good guy and finally i had a surety that yeah i like guys too. and trust me, guys are awesome. I had kindof cheated in my relationship so i decided to break up. i loved her back then and i love her till this day but i couldn't lie in out relationship ever. she cried i cried. i kept giving her lame reasons but not the real one. we are still friends, which is weird enough but we just cant let go and also i cant get together. now before i broke up, i came to accept myself as a bisexual. accepting one's own self and saying it out loud is a very huge task than it seems. i knew back then that i would have to come out to one of my best friend. he was the best person and he deserved to know. so it took all my courage and finally i messaged him. He was perfectly cool with it and told me he already knew it all this time and it wouldn't change a thing between us. It was so much a relief to me. time passed and i came to accepting myself as much as i can to the moment that now i am proud with how i am. then i completed my masters too successfully and i had the best understanding friends ever. I came to know that so many of my relatives and friends whom i always knew as straight were gay or bisexual and its so much weird and fun. 
The second incident happened to me very recently. i had this friend from like 12 years. he is one-of my best friend and knew most of myself except about my sexuality. He casually inquired me about this thing a few months back and i lied to him. he never brought the topic up again. untill i came out to him a month ago. as expected he took it very nicely and he told me my sexuality is not what defines me. it is a part of me and he has no issue regarding it. he never let that fact came in our friendship and neither should I. after talking to him last night in person, he told me he knew about this fact around 4 years back, (courtesy: my browser history :P). it was a shock for him initially but he came to terms with it in few days. he never told me because he understood it was a big thing for me and that i would tell him whenever i would feel like it. And guys trust me, all these years i didnt have any hint that he knew. he never brought it up. and he also told me that should i be willing to come out to our group that would be great too and all of them would be supporting me regardless of my sexuality. 
I really am proud to have such good friends. I will come out to them as time passes and i know they will be accepting and supporting as always. 
I know it has been a long post but i really wanted people to know that if u consider them ur true friends, they surely will be. 
And yeah, it feels so damm good to come out to someone. its one of the best feelings when u an be as u are with that person and not hide yourself under fake pretenses. I would like to thank a guy from mumbai, hes a famour young actor and a LGBTQ activist. his story and speeches have always given me the strength to accept myself and come out to people. and also cheers to the admins of this page. you people are doing a very fine job. 
Thank you for reading this and do message me if u want to talk about these things ever.</p>
<h1>GCIL- This is one of those moments when u want to shove this kind of posts into someone biphobic to shut their stupidity about bisexuality and bisexual guys.</h1>
