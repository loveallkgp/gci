<p>He called me a slut! :'(
He feels that I look good and so I go on street hunting guys. I apparently use him . I told him looks are NOT what matters and everyone looks beautiful the way they are. But he seems to be possessed with some kinda inferiority-complex!
I love that man like hell. He loves me too, I know. But what the hell m i suppose to do? Acid my face? Go dung it? Wear burka? What???
He said i can move outta his life if i've found someone else. I backfired "seems like u found someone else...this is it all about, right?"
He glared at me and said "I'm a SLUT like u!"
For the first time ever he abused me like this...I was completely shocked. I'm not being melodramatic...but I dont wanna loose him. How do I make him sure that all other guys on the planet are worth shit to me - all that matters is him!!!
...
I asked him if anyone said anything bout me or if he saw me doing anything indecent...then he was quite...he didnt deny...just said that it wasnt the point.
And he wont even lemme know what the fucking point is! Does he want sex? Is he liking someone else ( I wont believe it even if u say 'yes' :P )? Has he gotten bored of me.. <em>sigh</em>...yea ...how the fuck will u know about it...and why in the hell m i writing it here...You the biggest problem is -
He wont freaking talk to me khullam khulla about it. What do it do to open him? ;) and spill everything outta his mouth? Suggest.
And admin(s) - ur darlings :*
...
...
P.S. No Alcohol. :P</p>
<h1>GCI- Just give him some time to calm down and then you go and ask him about what is going on in his mind. Your relation is only gonna work if you have an open communication. If he is gonna have some assumptions or insecurities, then forget it now only.</h1>
