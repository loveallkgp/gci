<p>I am the same confessor of 2005 confession..</p>
<p>Admin</p>
<p>The same was applied by me.
I had my exams and still i was studying and was having chat with my bf. But he has an issue that i donot give time to him.
So shall i better leave him or try to make him understand more because i had tried almost 1000'$ times to make him understand but he doesnot and this is affecting my life. So is it better to leave aur just wait for the thing to be at there place ?</p>
<h1>GCI- Then its his mistake. You were having your exams so it was his duty to understand to give time to you for studying. You can't have your head go haywire through emotional drama when you have to prepare for your future. He should be understanding. Now, immediate decision under pressure is certainly not good. talk it out with him peacefully. Say to him that he can have all the time in the world while you are free from exams and all. That can cool impatient people down. If he still doesn't understand then you better know what to do.</h1>
