<h1>GCI- Congratulations you just discovered and explored your sexuality. Think clearly what you want from your supposed loved ones. If you really like the guy as a person and not just a someone to have sex with, you can go for him, but make sure you clear it all out with the girl Either way clear it out with both of them to not have any guilt or drama later on.</h1>
