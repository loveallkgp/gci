<p>helo guys... how r u all
as in my previous confession i discussed about true love beyond the sexual orientation ... many guys here disagreed ... </p>
<p>Hmmm.. so today this happened
i made my mind and asked my lover if he is top or bottom ..<br>
He replied ... does that matter 
i said ..yes ..tell me 
He said - u tell me first .
i asked .. why ?
He : If u  r top then i will be a bottom and if u r bottom i will be a top.... all i want is u to be here with me all my life... just bcoz if we find out we both r top or bottom does it mean we have to break up... No wayyyyy !!! 
 i love u sweetu ..... always </p>
<p>i was surprised by his answer ... for a minute i thought that just bcoz few assholes here made some silly comments on my last post ..and i asked my buddy about it ...<br>
 Oh God .. he really loves me and care about me .. and i must appreciate that... :-* 
 and now i just want to ask all those jerks that if u fall in love wid a guy whose orientation is same as that of u... he possess all d qualities except this one.. what will u guys do... leave him??<br>
 u guys have not found someone so loving and caring ...like me. :-) once u do ... the thing what u want in bed will not matter at all.....<br>
bye!! </p>
