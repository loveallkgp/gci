<p>You spend most precious moments of you life trying to convince an asshole to be your boyfriend but never give an idiot a fair chance who loves you so much and been with you forever. </p>
<p>hey I'm Matt from Mumbai and I've spent 8 months of my life in misery, crying, begging down on my knees to that one asshole whom I gave everything, my time, my love, my life, my money almost everything I had but he never gave me anything in return, no love nothing. </p>
<p>I was disheartened, I physically abused myself, went in depression, life became worthless. </p>
<p>but thanks to John, you've been a special part of my life, my best best best friend, you've always been there for me, with me, done everything, you even had fight with your parents for me, and I never loved you that way. but I guess your love has changed me, I can't live without you, Your late night calls, what's app pe messages, mujhe irritate karna, I love when you do this To me. </p>
<p>I'm very happy to have a best friend cum boyfriend like you and yesterday when we celebrated our first anniversary, my past gave a call to me and I was happy to say that,"fuck u bitch" to him because yup I'm happily in love with my John who loves me a lot n I love him soooooooooo much, may be more than he does. </p>
<p>All that I wanna say guys is that just move away from your past because someone in your present loves you a lot and can make your future bright n loving. </p>
<p>Sometimes I just imagine that if I were still stucked with my past, life would have been worst and for a second if that guy whom I liked in my past would have accepted me after so much emotional pain that he gave me, I guess from within, my heart would have never accepted him as a loyal boyfriend and I might have become a slut by now :(</p>
