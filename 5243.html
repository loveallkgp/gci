<p>My cousin(girl) had a BF who is almost sissy, you can kinda tell he is gay, but they are rich. They actually liked each other, or from my cousin's side maybe it was the perks he brought, but his parents probably knew about him and they were trying hard to get him a girl i think. They provided him all he needed to give to my cousin, including a lumia phone. Once I was staying at my cousins place for the weekend, he was there from sunrise till late night everyday. He was on their desktop doing fb and suddently the wiring fused and the desktop died, they just left. when i fixed and stated the desktop, firefox had the whole session opened and i looked into his inbox, he had chatted with a gay guy I know. This guy was asking him to give him a ride to some office and he had agreed. I was not surprised. This was about a year ago and they have broken up a long time ago. But i like this exboyfriend of my cousin, Help me!!!</p>
