<p>Hi admin. 
This may seem silly to you,  but i had to tell you about this. I'm  gay obviously,  and the last few months I have come a long way on the road to accepting myself. But i still have doubts,  there are days when i deny my being gay and some days i completely accept and love how fabulous i am. I have come out to my 2 closest friends, and they said they were fine. But i don't know why they have stopped talking or contacting me anymore. They only talk when we absolutely have to. You get it? It's hard but i understand. On the same note, i haven't been able to maintain my friendships. It starts with great talk and hangouts and the usual connection/ bond forging.  But i feel afraid that i won't be able to take their rejection when they realize the truth about me. Am i ruining earthing i have just because of my insecurities or is this a normal thing? I feel alone(I bet you saw that coming).  I don't wann end up like one of those creepy uncles who harass boys on the public transport to satisfy their sexual frustration (I'm  not kidding,  has happened unsuccessfully to me). But yeah I'm  23 and i have no real friends and i think I'll truely be alone. 
Ps: i have a boyfriend currently(long distance) the first two months were usual butterfly in stomach and yada yada romantic,  but i sense a change in him now a days. He won't text for days(i understand he could be busy) and i give him space but yeah a single text a day makes my day(how pathetic!!) anyway i don't think it's gonna work, he's cute and really cooks great,  but I'm  really bad a t confrontation. 
If you are not dozing after reading this(phew!!!)  i want to thank you sooooo much for the great work you are doing handling this page,  giving us broken/confused/lonely people some hope. 
Love you admin(s) </p>
<h1>GCIL- Okay....Lemme make it clear to u to unburden urself.</h1>
<p>1- Don't overthink on ur friendships and relationship.
2- Stop holding the 'alone card'. Try to learn ur solitude and what it offers and be ur friend first at all the levels.
3- Do not expect ur life to change with a magic wand. Its NOT bad...u r over emphasising on its negative points pointlessly.
4- All u need is to accept the fact that u need a happening life with positive people who can make u fuck all the negativity.</p>
<p>P.S- LDR's r meant to be problematic....do not add to the excess of baggage in ur life and treat it normally.</p>
