<p>I am 24 year old guy from Goa, i had been to the university at Goa and after my work at the university was waiting for a bus. Just then a guy in early 30's on his Activa stopped and asked me the directions to some place. I guided him to go straight on the highway, so also as he was alone on the bike I asked for lift as I too was heading towards the same junction where he was going. He agreed. On the way he asked me if I had a gf, i declined and he again questioned as to why I dont have a gf when I look hot and handsome. When he said so he immediately extended his one hand behind and started rubbing my crotch. I was shocked. He then asked me if he could suck my dick, I refused. Then he asked whether i could suck his cock, which I again rejected. He continued on asking me again and again that i won't get such offer later, while he was not stopping to rub his hand against my dick. He asked me to atleast touch his dick, that too i refused to do. Finally I reached the junction where I could get off his bike. He wasn't looking that good also and was a stranger for me, so I refused his offers. But was shocked by his behaviour and heights of being desperate for sex. Secondly I dont understand how he knew I'm straight or gay or even inspite of not knowing about my orientation he dared to do this. Weird &amp; Shocking</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you know some people can start asking anyone if they are desperate. Don't be bothered. Some do it near the washrooms, some do it on the streets.</h1>
