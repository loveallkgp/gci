<p>Hello Admins, today in college my love my crush followed me while i was walking down. I turned back and saw, he was like checking his phone. Immediately I turned and made a way to him. Then asked him to go first. He smiled and started to walk. Now I followed him :D :D :D :D :D . I checked him , so I hide in a place. He was searching me :D :D :D . Suddenly i peeped out, now he was BLUSHING. Then he went to staff room. When I was in my class he came  :D :D he given a nice smile. I didn't know what he talked with my class professor, but he oftenly noticed me :D :D . I love you Ajay baby. Love you da baby.</p>
