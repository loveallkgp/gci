<p>so this guy today,wow dressed like a woman wowww,on the theme of vampire showcase he dressed the same to represent himself as a vampire in a saariii.......
and people on the page say,he is representing queer community of india,bullshit he is representing the mediocre,retarted,ill mentality, multi personalee humanee ..he must be suffering from  that type of disorder......
we are living where our relatives friends family have seen gay as a transgender only yes admit that.......these guys on the shows admit themselves as gay instead of admitting themselves as transgender or disorder of multipersonality..comon, you have came out to the society(only option for you) atleast dont make us difficult to come out(many options atleast we look like a boy or man have mind thoughts of man boy)  in family etc by behaving like a woman...even women dont irritate people like him........
where the hell is written that queer has to dress up like a retard woman..</p>
<p>just search your surrounding you guys will find only these types of guys came out openly because they dont have any other option but being "this"..but we have many......people only understand this creature to be gay and if you choose a option of coming out in society people will secretly laugh and sarcastically say "yaa... like him who was on big boss"......then your parents you yourself find what would be going to feel!!!!
rest hater do hate me like this , i am practical i have job i have people to love, i have society to come across i have famil y and I DONT WANT PEOPLE TO GUESS YES THIS IS THE SAME GUY LIKE SUSHANT ,CHALLLO ASK HIM KYA YE BHI SAARI PEHNTA HAI.....OH GOD :'(</p>
<h1>GCI- Why do you have to rely on others even if you have to come out? Pehle to aana nahi hai, dusra, jab koi ek particular tareeke se behave kare to kehna hai ki "Isne hamari image kharab kar di hai ab to vaise bhi nai aa sakte." That seriously sounds like an excuse to hide back in the veil. If you are indeed a proud one and believe in yourself then his behavior should not really bother your ass. Stop crying from there.</h1>
