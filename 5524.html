M just tierd.........my mind is not working
M really confused about my sexuality.
M I a gay or bisexual ?
I had 2 straight gf at my past dat Tym I was bisexual.
But from last some days my I have made a perception dat I can share everything if I have a gay bf but I can't share everything if I have a gf
So,
I think my 1% intrest towards boys has been increased b4 my intrest towards boys n girls was 50-50 now its lyk 49-51 but now I think I can share everything if I can have a lesbian or bisexual gf!
I don't knew my way of thinking is correct or m getting more calculative ....what to do
Mene friends se baat ki toh they said m thinking more n m not using my heart m using my mind
Guys plz kuch achha suggest kero plz</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, even I thought that I was bisexual around 3 years back. Some people are really bisexual but some guys just pretend.</h1>
<p>However, I'd say when you are confused, just let things be. Go with the flow and don't think about labels. Whatever comes your way, go with it if you like it.</p>
<p>But if you do want to find out about yourself, analyze yourself by asking yourself to which gender you are romantically, physically and emotionally attracted. If it's both you are a bisexual, if not then you are gay. </p>
<p>PS- Don't worry about adding and subtracting numbers. They don't matter.</p>
