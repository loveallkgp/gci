<p>I am raj age 27 from madhya pradesh.. good looking and hot guy. I want to share mainly two things for which I may kill myself.firstly I am gay and family pressure for marriage.
Secondly the main reason -at the age of 12 I was dreaming to become IAS. and that was only my aim. . Gave UPSC exam twice and twice reached interview but was rejected as I stammer... than tried for IIM ..again same thing rejected in interview . tried all things medical treatment .. speech therapy , went yo banglore etc but still no imprprovement . i cry alot that why god made me such ??
now just planning for suicide as don't want to do other job like clerk in bank..</p>
<h1>GCI- That is just pure crap on the part of judge panel who interviewed you! if you have talent then who the hell are they just to reject you on the basis of stammering which is not even an issue! If stephen hawking can be paralyzed but still can manage to be the greatest mind of the present era and have Ph.D students under him, why you be denied of the job of your choice? Don't suicide. It will be a loss of pure talent such as yourself! You just lack confidence in your life. Your stammering cannot be a deciding factor for your future. If you have confidence you can get past that interview. So next time if you happen to go to the interview, use that stephen hawking example and show those people what they lack!</h1>
