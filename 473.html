<p>Hey admin ur too good. Am just tired of this things yaar. People really havng wrong idea about gays. They thng hizzras,and chakkas r gays. Comon gays r physical alryt. they just love a guy thats it. And in India msg starts frm t/b asl place size etc etc. People r so sex freak. They just want to quench the lust. Is there anythng called love or not? A gay doesnt mean a slut yar. we have feelngs. We too want to be loved. People who r hungry for sex thinks everyone wil be like them. No place for feelngs. People in fb comes and say i love u with terms and conditn. m top so ur bot. In love positn matters?? what the crap. m 18 plz add me 8 inch c#ck with place,kaun lega mera whats al these shits. Mentaly sick people are. Just hate it.</p>
<h1>Viv- Let me explain to you something after which you will really begin thinking. Sex seekers are not the real threat. Atleast they are honest with what they want. The real problem lies with those people who fake love to get into someone's pants. And when their lust is over, the poor victim is left in tears and depression. But honestly, love is also there. Be not a pessimist. World is big enough for everyone to have their desired partners.</h1>
