<p>Hola admin,
I am 22 yrs old putting up in Dehradun and working for an IT company. I have been working from quite a young age. This is my 2nd job. I m a gay by soul. Though, i am very manly and straight looking, still i have been open and candid about my sexual orientation. Fortunately, i have always been appreciated by the straight circle that i have been in be it school, college or my 1st job. I have never felt closeted. But, i just switched to a new job 2 months back and i already feel so closeted, i can't breathe ! This company has homophobic employees as i come to know. They have also fired some employees in past due to their orientation. I want to live my life the way i have lived till now, open and transparent. That's what define me. I don't want to tom tom everyone about i being gay but also i don't want to wear a facade. My friend's say that i should not disclose it to the office at any cost and even if someone asks i have to deny it emphatically and show that i m offended. They say it out of concern for me, personally as well as professionally. I am in a fix right now. Not able to be who i am. Please suggest what should i do ?</p>
