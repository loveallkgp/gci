<p>hey admin.. how have you been?</p>
<p>i want to ask one thing..
i have a friend in class.. we are bench mate and very good friend too. i have feelings for him so through my acions to him. he doubted on me but i cleared it to him.. first me he thought I'm kidding but later he laughed and said this'll be secret, a huge interesting secret..</p>
<p>but from that day,</p>
<p>wants me to give blow job.. i gave him it once.. he wants smooches on his thigh, belly when we are in class and often opens his zip and says to me to play with it.. and he even allowed me to suck his nipples..i have kissed him on his chick.. and sometimes i play by making round circles on his face, lips with my finger.. and also i like to play with his hair.. but he has never said anything rather he liked it. but he says keep this stuffs secret..</p>
<p>so tell me is he into males or straights like too? or he being nice to me? though he said he don't like touch dick..and even he smooches on my thigh and nipples sevral times.</p>
<h1>GCI- See, he can be just a horny guy who doesn't care about who touches him. Hell, he can even let his dog suck him off if he has one. One day when his insecurities or "conscious" will kick in, he will start ignoring you and will blame you for whatever "you" did to him. Your friendship will be over.</h1>
<p>Or! He could just be gay.</p>
