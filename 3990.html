<p>I'm a bisexual boy but i dont like sex. I mean its ok about kissing hugging or even oral sex but when its come to the real gay sex( anal sex) there is something really pushing me back.
Yesterday one of my good frnd call me to his home and when i arrived he asked me for sex, i told him that i dont like it but he forced. And at the point i did it ( except anal) for the first time. After this incident i really feel that im not gay, i mean i dont like gay sex, so........ its a big confusion.
But i love to see good looking boys, and dreaming to have a life partner. I can feel that if i get my love (may b a boy) than i can spent my whole life with him. But now im really confused as i dislike the sexual part.
So weird.</p>
<h1>GCI- Being gay or anything doesn't mean that you have to have anal sex. Its not compulsory. Some couples don't have that. Or maybe you dislike it now because you haven't fallen in love. But once you do, maybe you'd change your mind. No need to be confused or anything.</h1>
