<p>So after 2.5 years of relationship he finally broke up with me. I always knew this was coming. I always knew he was secretly in love with a common friend of ours. And why not he was smarter and more good looking than me and both had a great chemistry. I was just the unbalanced part of the equation. I always knew I was never good enough for him. It was hard for me, I mean it's obvious breakups are hard. But guess what I am not angry with him and why should I be....every person has one life to live and he has every right to choose what's best for himself. He has chosen what's best for himself and I accept it. 
Sorry Kiran I tried my best to be good for you but I guess I have failed. And Hey please never ever feel guilty for breaking up with me, I don't have an ounce of regret in dating you. I will always cherish the moments I had with you with you for the rest of my life. someday in the future when we are old and wrinkled maybe we meet by chance, have a cup of green tea together and talk about our time together and have a hearty laugh about it. 
But as of now too bad we are meant to be strangers as I am leaving this city forever, my last train leaves in 45 mins. Lol I had to pay 4500 bucks to get a confirmed seat. By the time you read this confession I shall be halfway through the journey. Will definitely miss you but I am left with no other choice. Goodbye </p>
<h1>GCI- It's good that you have accepted the breakup but you are underestimating yourself. You clearly don't love yourself as you should.</h1>
