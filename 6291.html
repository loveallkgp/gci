<p>Its my first confession and i hope admin will post it...
see since i m on this facebook and i have chatted many people with fake id's.....i m nice luking guy but also expect my partner to be same.....but after chatting when we exchange photos these people comes out to be reallly ugly...not ugly but sometimes they are aged men....many times they beg for sex....clearly i have not found someone good....and i hope i will find him soon...
i just wanna be honest as looks do matter for me and those who talk about beauty of heart and all are liars in most of the cases....its the ugly truth.....
BUT since i have followed this page...i am completely mesmerised by admin........i have a huge crush on admin and i dont care about his looks.....and bcozz of admin now i am seeing the perspective of the world that is the beauty of heart which was alien to me sometime ago....well
P.S.- admin love is a big word....but i really like u.....</p>
<h1>GCI- Good boy ! Its nice that u have taken into account what we try to convey here...but one thing what if I had been really ugly?</h1>
<p>N.B- There are 2 admins ..which one do u have a crush on?</p>
