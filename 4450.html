<p>Many started to ask me why i am not interested in finding a life partner as i am just 24. I asked the same questions to myself and found these answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would love to have but my mind cannot find its way beyond Karthik, the original owner of my fake profile name. All I see is karthik and karthik alone. He still mesmerises me, though it had been 2 years sinc i last saw him ! This is what I am. I feel i am made for karthik in this birth. My mind is not even going for anyone. ( He is straight, my senior in college, on whom i have fallen in love before knowing all about straight and gay. )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I think of having a partner, I search for them, but all I see is imperfect human beings. i was keep on seeing like this untill I have found a highly imperfect human ! yes thats me ! So i sat and found what sort of imerfections i have in life before searching for such a great soul as a life partner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the process i found, self correcting my imperfections, be it physical, emotional, mental seems to be the more joyful, meaningful thing that can ever happen to me or to anyone. I found everythnig else in the world, be it finding life partner or searchnig for sex, all seem to be completely meaningless nonsense.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Leading a gay life with partner be it india or in USA or anywhere, is always problematic. People think west is great, but people just tolerate, not respect you. There are extremely very few who wholeheartedly accepts you as you are. I am tired of convincing idiots about what homosexuality is. Missing india and leading a life with your partner alone seeing both of your faces daily is funny to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The very idea of searching partner in fb and bothers me. May be i am immature to understand the reality or may be i am the only right man. But I cannot feel or sense a person in fb in his totality. i am sorry people. if someone stands before me i can sense who they are and it had always been 80% right throughout my life. this is impossible in fb, that too in fake accounts. sometimes its okay in original profile, as there are more chances of people being true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are more interesting things in life than getting into a commitment, i personally feel. be in volunteering, teaching yoga, working for the society, gardening, adventurous sports, travelling, doing science, history, blog writing, etc all this seem to be damn too interesting than sitting with your loved ones and feeling how loved you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On top of all this, i am more interested in expression of happiness than in pursuit of happiness. This is more simple. searching of love is boring. giving love is more full-filling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks !</p>
