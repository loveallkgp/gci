<p>Hey there,
I am Vipul, 28 years old guy married and straight. Sorry, I am not flaunting my sexuality but just want to make it clear.
Recently, one of my friends told me in confidence that he is gay. I never had any problem with gay people. But when one of your friends is one, it's quite shock. I had no clue how to react towards him. We are friends from last 7-8 years. We had a lot of fun together. I never thought even for a second that he could be gay. He was seen with girls a lot and our group thought him as a playboy.
Now he is going to get married to a girl in our group. If he is gay, then how can he marry a girl. To be honest, I tried to google this and the response I am getting is that he shouldn't. Both are my friends. I don't want to meddle in their affair. But I can't keep this burden. I tried to talk to my friend but he shut me out. I tried my other friend (the girl) not to marry him, and she wanted to know why. I had no answer to that. I can't out him and I can't see him destroying his life as well as of that girl's.
What should I do? Or should I keep mum as my wife said and let it go.
PS: I don't have any problem with LGBTs. I have a lesbian friend and my wife's cousin is gay. I judge people coz of their actions not for their sexualities.
Peace
Parkash</p>
<h1>GCI- Wow! Your friend is making one big mistake. If they are your friends, I guess it is your responsibility to guide them towards the correct path. Make your friend understand the truth. He shut you out because he is in denial. Make him sit down and have a peaceful conversation. If he trusted you enough to share his life's big secret with you and he can share a few of his insecurities as well. If he still does not understand, then again, let destiny play its role.</h1>
