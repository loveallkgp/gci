<p>Hi admin...ma self sanmay ! After gettin exposed..somehow i lost ma family's care &amp; affection except mom..ma lover introduced me to his parents just kill d orphan feeling...i call both mom &amp; dad too.evn though its a long distance relationship..but yeah I love him more than anything else..we guys had our 10 months together back on july'3rd..from his side dad called me on father's day anyways ma point was that I liked the way you respond to people's conf. especially "straight as pole one" </p>
<h1>GCI- Its hard to see someone as good as you had to go through family indifference(yes you are in my friendlist). But anyways, be happy and spread the love to you parents. Earlier they didn't know you fully and now they do. They will take time to come to terms with it but soon they will. God bless you.</h1>
