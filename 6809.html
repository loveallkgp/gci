<p>I was never the kind of son my parents wanted me to be. Though always good in studies I could not clear the much hyped premedical test instead I went on to become a physiotherapist, which I have been practicing for two years. My elder brother on the other hand cleared the test with a good rank and went on to become a surgeon. Something my parents are very proud of along with all the other relatives. I was born in a middle class brahmin family in Lucknow. My father is a bank manager and my mother is a teacher, though both are educated their thinking, like most of the people in my city is that of 19th century. The major topic of discussion in my house is caste, religion, intercaste marriages, love jihad, wo uske saath bhaag gayi, usne divorce le liya, etc etc. 
I being a person of liberal perspective, never agree with them, on the other hand my brother (who went for arranged marriage with a girl of the same caste) is a strong believer of hindutva and brahmin superiority. Whenever we are having a conversation, it turns into an argument with other three viciously attacking my thoughts. They made it quite clear to both of us that if we go for intercaste marriages then there is no need for us to have any contact with them. It has been ten months that I have gone home. I had booked the ticket in advance as I dint wanted to celebrate Diwali alone. But now I am seriously reconsidering it. I know that they are going to shun me once I tell them, therefore I don't want to give them the privilege. I feel suffocated there anyways. Sometimes I thank my destiny too that I was born this way as it helped me become more accepting of diversity. Otherwise I might have turned out to be like them. </p>
<h1>GCI- So clearly the love for their children means them less than the love for their supposed superiority.The person who thinks that they are superior based on race, caste, religion or skin color is already at an all time low. It's better that you have decided what's good for you. Hope you have a good life.</h1>
