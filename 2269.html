<p>I am writing the confession for the first time.... On FB most of gays are sex seekers...as soon as you accept any request first Question your asl, top or bottom,do you like 69..? and so on many bullshit questions....and if they dont like your photo,they block you or stop replying....sometimes i think that being gay is approximately similar to being a male prostitutes as 95% people say that i have slept with these many persons and all that....they make boyfriends according to look so they can enjoy sex...ufff.... few people are in true love here other all are sex seeker..(though no one will confess this)..... when i see this,i feel very uncomfortable.....i believe that a relation must start with a pure friendship without sex atleast for 6 months(my belief)....can we ever get a true gay FRIEND...?? Think about it.....</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh darling, this has been confessed a million times here. Put each one on his own and do what you want. Indeed the guys who seek sex are abundant here and other social networking platforms, but there are those too who dream about having a domestic partnership. For those people sex isn't mandatory. You really don't have to feel uncomfortable. If you get these type of people just say "not interested" and be done with the convo. Those who think like you, will always keep the talks to be totally platonic.</h1>
