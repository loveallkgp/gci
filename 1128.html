<p>hi. im in love with my friend... he's very close to me. we spend alot time together. he already has a gf but sometimes he treats me as I am his gf he keEPS a check on what I do with whom I chat . he also said once or asked if u were gay would u date me I took as a joke.. sometimes he talks to me abt girls im really confused . and ill be happy if he's in my life.</p>
<h1>Viv- Straights don't know what type of effect these talks have on gay guys. But keeping a check on what a partner does and whom he/she chats with, is that boyfriend specific? I don't think it is. But as you live close to him so you know better. Honestly, don't have any hopes. Keeping false hopes on won't do you any good and you will become sad if things won't happen your way(which they won't). It's better to move on.</h1>
