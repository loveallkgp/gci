<p>m just 17 n got cheated / left away/ insulted ..</p>
<p>i like 30-40 aged guy so i met one guy on fb ... bcme friends .. planned to meet him n hav sex .. it was my first experience n was excited too!!</p>
<p>so as plan we met, had conversations, he ordered meals, had sex.. though m not bottom but he requested 1000times so he fucked me!!
and after sex he said he will be right back in 5min after takin money from atm!!</p>
<p>i said ok n was waiting but he dint came within 15mins so i called him but i was scared after hearing that his mobile is switched off!! i tried him to call till 2 hours but still it was switched off..
i thought he might be online on fb so checked but he had blocked him!!
i was really scared n dint know why i started to crying.. after waiting for 3hours .. i decided to go home!!
and the reception the manager said he hasn't played the bill..</p>
<p>then i was really scared and my leg was shaking coz the bill was 2000 n i was having just 100..
i dint know what to do.. i called him infront of those managers and waiterss.. it was still switched off!!</p>
<p>then i called my dad coz no other option was left!!</p>
<p>dad came and paid the bill and slapped me infront of those managers and the manager said to my dad " ye aapka beta itni choti umar me itna bada admi k saath ye single room me gandi cheez karne aya tha.. samjha dijiye aapka beta ko!! " n dad was shocked and ghar me jakar mujhe boht scold kiya dad ne ..mara v .. aur baad me khud v ro rahe the.. "ek hi beta tha wo v ladki bann raha he aur bachpan se hi ghatiya kaam kar raha he""</p>
<p>ye kehete kehete ro rahe the ..</p>
<p>and i m fed up with my life!!!
kisi k upat trust hi nhi hota!!</p>
<h1>Viv- There is no crying over spilt milk. Hate those guys who manipulate young people like this but this is a nice life long lesson for you. Kahi na kahi galti sabki hai, tumhari, hotel management ki, but sabse zyada to wo aadmi ki hai. Aise bande namard hote hain. Coward.</h1>
