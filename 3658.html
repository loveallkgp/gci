<p>Pla admin post it..... i am from kashmir and presently studying in Dehradun... i want to say that i met a guy who also lives in dehradun..i just fell in love very much...he is really very nice and sweet... I was in a relationship with a guy who also lives in kashmir...we broke up before 8 months..now he called me yesterday and i was in tears...he said that he still loves me and wants to meet me...i am not able to decide what to do,i am not able to forget me,i also still love him...plz give me suggestion whom to choose</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, see the reason why you broke up. Then if possible you two can work it out and the past won't affect you, then you can be together again. BTW, he is just asking about meeting you. I guess a meeting won't hurt. But I have seen this with many people that when they meet their exes again, they get back together and after a few months it ends even more badly again. So even if you want to take that step, do it wisely.</h1>
