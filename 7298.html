<p>I'm suspended from clg for 10 days bcoz i swor her...</p>
<p>the thing is that 
I'm an open gay..
and from the day she came to know this..
she started talking shits about..
like spreading " this guy is gay " to everyone..</p>
<p>and when i spoke about it to her face..
she was shouting on me by saying she hasn't done anything toh i ignored that time..</p>
<p>and then again came to know that she even told about me to teachers..
and my friend told me that she had crush on me but when she came to know about my sexuality .. she started hating me..</p>
<p>and then it was way too high time for me.. so i went to her and told her that I'm gay some know this.. some doesn't.. but you don't have any fucking right to tell everyone about sexuality without my presence...
and then she said " tu chakka he .. kal se lipstick lagake aiyo, cool dude banna chhod de..  and be like genuine chakka by putting on some make ups and ear rings" with a loud voice in front of juniors and my classmates.. they were laughing at me.. she even pushed me away while saying those words.. she was accompanied by her 4 friends
and then i told her that I'm just gay but i can be a man but you should be a girl rather than being a whore searching for dicks.. sorry my dick is not for you so don't get frustrated... search for other dicks bitch .. she wanted to slapped me but she couldn't and walked away by crying and saying " respect the gender female"</p>
<p>my words were too sharps but just bcoz someone is feminist .. she doesn't get the right to do everything to males whether he's gay or straight..</p>
<h1>GCI- Listen dude, there is nothing feminist about her.</h1>
<p>1- She is a pseudo feminist..Proof- when she said k choodiyan pehen le, lipstick laga le...she herself derogated her sex and gender.</p>
<p>2- Next time, say more, do not shut up just because u r gay.</p>
<p>3- These are those breed of women who rape men and then use the sexist patriarchal law to save their ass.</p>
<p>4- No woman or man has the right to insult us or the trans people for who we are and if someone does, u must know what to do.</p>
<p>5- She bullied u and u bullied her back....nothing wrong in it..but beware of choosing the ryt set of words, because in our country there is a growth in the number of 'feminazists'.</p>
<p>6- DO NOT THINK that feminism has got anything to do with women....it has got to do everything with equality....and unisexism says the same too!</p>
<p>7- Gay men when being despised by some women for being gay points to one thing- They are no less shitty than the homophobic gaymen, strt men and shitheads of the sort. Do not respect anyone just because that individual is without a penis, respect is earned and not demanded by having a vagina or a penis!</p>
<p>NEXT TIME, U MAY CHOOSE TO GET COMFORTABLE ABOUT BEING CALLED GAY when she does this or get into trouble by slapping her....the choice is urs!!!</p>
<p>WOMEN'S DAY AND THIS POST...-IRONICAL.</p>
