<p>It was my fourth semester of B. Tech, that I had lend my hard disk to one of my friends. There used to be a picture of two gay men kissing, which I had hidden folders within folders in that hard disk. I thought I had deleted that picture. He returned me that hard disk after a few days. A week later he came to my room, and there were other friends as well and we were chatting, after some time all my friends left and he was the only one left in the room and we were discussing something, suddenly he asked me in a normal tone, "teri life ka aisa koi secret hai jo kisi ko na pata ho", I was a little surprised but was not totally sure what he meant, I said, "pata nahin waise to bahut saare honge, sabke hote hai". Then he told me he found a photo in my hard disk, I was flabbergasted, I could not speak. I had always known that he had a very liberal perspective but I was very afraid of telling anything to anyone. He sensed my reaction that I was afraid and he said "dekh darr mat main nahin bolunga kissi ko, main abhi bhi teri utni hi respect karta hoon, aur mereko koi farak nahin padta isse". Initially I was a little skeptical about it, then later as time passed I realised that he sincerely meant what he said, nothing changed between us, except that we had became even better friends and we started spending more time together. I told him everything about my life, as to how I came out to my mother, and the way I was subjected to shrinks and their so called 'homosexuality curing medicines', he was disgusted by these so called doctors and he said that he will always support me no matter what, I was good in studies(in fact the class topper), so I used to teach him, he on the other hand had no interest in studies and wanted to be a movie director, he was having a tough time managing his studies and his passion for movies, I tried to help him with the best I could. As time passed by I realized that I was in love him, I felt that I was taking his advantage by trying to spend time with him. One month before the college was about to end, I confessed to him that I was in love with him. He said, "mujhe to bahut pehle se pata tha, dikh jaata hai yaar". On the last day of college, I requested him to spend one entire day with me, he agreed and we went on a date, and that night I slept holding his hand, with him next to me on my bed. Its been a year since I left the college, I try not to contact him but whenever I feel alone, I feel compelled to call him. I was placed in a reputed company for which I moved to Pune. I haven't seen him since the last day of college, neither do I try, as I know that I'll have to get over him, but the truth be told it seems impossible to do so, the time I spent with him was the most wonderful time in my life. It is the only source of happiness for me now, the fact that he took the whole thing so normally helped me open out to my other two friends, both of whom are totally cool with it, now I feel very much relieved that I don't have to live a lie, not at least in front of my closest friends. I am hopeful that a time will come when I will be able walk in the streets with my head held high, even if everyone knows that I am gay, and it will be a totally normal thing, yes I will be a little different, but not any more than me being a left hander.</p>
