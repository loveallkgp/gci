<p>love is in the air &lt;3 
the feeling of having someone u always wanted in urn life is amazing ..... when we actually fall in love wid someone only then we realise actual meaning of what love is...... 
   He send me this bunch of beautiful roses on my b'day to my home ..... though i lied at home that it was by my gf ... ;-)
   He calls me everyday in morning and before night just to say that he loves me soooooo much ..... 
   I met him many times .. what we do is... Hug each other tightly without saying a word ... kiss each other on cheek...and hug again .. 
   He often send me roses and chocolates to my home ... (although everyone in home thinks that i have a nice girlfriend)
:-) 
 we never discussed about ones sexual preferences till date..still we r falling more and more in love every day ...... 
   I just want to say that why we always start asking top/bottom if we want to start a friendship with someone we like.... if two straight people start doing same thing imagine what would happen 
  If we want gays to be treated like straight then we should first start behaving like normal ... 
  We have made this image ourself in the society as if we want only sex and nothing else.... 
  Think about it guys .... 
  Behave like a human otherwise animals also have sex without a relationship ..... 
Think about it1</p>
<h1>GCI- I agree and disagree at the same time..</h1>
<p>AGREE bcoz u said the ryt thing about sex stuff.
DISAGREE bcoz strts have fixed heteronorms...and moreover our homonorms are based on them but it is not the exact copy of heteronormativity....U can live ur life anyway u want..but make ur own rules and regulations individually which are non harming in general and its ok to be with ur kind but it doesnt make a big difference whether we ask top bott verse or not.....but whether we do know the person deeply we are loving!
Gayism is not to be based on straight's parameters all the time..THATS NOT WORTH IT..AND AT TIMES IS ALTOTAL DINOSHIT!</p>
