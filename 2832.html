Guys, every body says "I am proud to be a gay" and campaigns for our community supports this phrase but seriously telling "i ashamed to be a gay"...thts not becos being gay is sin or anything like that... the main reason is the fucking attitude and nature of these facebook gays who always looking for sex.... can i ask a question that being gay is all about having sex with a boy. I met many people..understand many people or i should i tired to understand many people...i conclude out of 100 2 or 3 people are normal with their mind sets others are just...top bottom vers type.
That is the core reason why we are abused. We are not abused becos we are gay...we are abused becos we ourself change the definition of being a gay. If we really want a respectful position in the society , we have to change ourselve first than we can blame others. I may be wrong on some points and i knw people on fb always waiting to criticize but whatevr the things is... the main point is that we really need to change our attitude. I left this facebook so called gay world becos i tried to change people but in vain.
lots of love...k..w...r keep guessing :P</p>
<h1>GCI- Well its upon you what makes you proud and what makes you ashamed. Take me for example, I am a proud gay but the recent events in my life have made me feel ashamed of some people of the community. Attitude changing happens when you yourself speak out so that others can be inspired. Otherwise its all la-dee-dah.</h1>
