<h1>GCI- Hmmmm. i will twist ur words somewhat....LOOKS matter but u fall in love with a face and persona with whom u feel the spark!</h1>
<p>It is ok that u want a good looking guy but its not about looks, money, and body all the time....its about the connection at all the levels that lead to ultimate satisfaction(pseudo it is) in our life.
If u really are in mutual love then u can always find to make ur partner the best and be the best for him....bcoz NO ONE WANTS TO BE BELOW AVERAGE ...but the truth is THERE IS NO PARAMETER TO MEASURE MEDIOCRITY!</p>
<p>P.S- We think that perfectionism and satisfaction matters...but in reality we have not seen or felt an iota of what it is!!</p>
