<h1>GCI- You still keep his contact and here lies all the problem. If you want to really move on from someone, you have sever all the connections. be it cell contact, facebook, memories, and other blabbity bleh. And if you still expect to be friends with them after the breakup, you nearly not loved him enough. You have to give yourself a break from thinking about him. One day or the other you get an urge to text him or call him or see him or hear his voice. This has to stop. Then only you will be completely over him.</h1>
