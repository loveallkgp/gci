I ws girly so evry 1 used 2 tease me.. Evn my parent's nvr tried 2 understand me.. Life was like hell.. Thought of sucide also.. But couldn't do.. Now the big truth of my life.. I wnt to be a girl.. I fell as if m locked in a boy's body.. Life suck's whn i find girls of my age hvng fun.. Nd i can't do anything.. As in my growing yrs i got lot's of taunt frm evrywhre..so I tried avoding public places.. always tried to be at home.. Nd presently m 16 nd alone.. I can't find evn 1 frnd .. I don't hav frnd's... I find boys of my age enjoyng so much.. But i can't.. I m sum where in the midle.. So i really think sucide woud be the best option.. U knw wht admin i was nt able 2 share this with any1 nt evn my parent.. As they nvr tried 2 understand me.. For them m jst a loser.. Gud 4 nothng.. M nt gud at studies also.. Neither in anyother thing.. I too think m a loser.. Thank's admin for opening this page soo for the 1st time i was able 2 share my dark truth with any... Evn if i stay alife.. I jst don't how i ll survie?? Wht ll happen with me?? Woud i get sum1 who ll luv more than himself?? Again sum1 wll tease me.. Soo i thnk it's bttr i shold end my life... Cause i knw aaj taak kuch aacha nhi hua aur naa kbhi hoo gaa. With me.. </p>

<h1>Viv- Honey, no one will understand you. And those who will understand you won't tease you. So it would be better to hold on to yourself and not give a damn to others. Suicide is NOT an option. You have tolerated so much in your entire life, faced that brutality(trust me I know how it feels). Have courage to NOT take cowardly decisions. If you are not good at studies then you may have some other interests. And time and again I say that focusing your thoughts on a fact that relation will save you from everything will lead you nowhere. Do not be a pessimist in life. Been there, done that. Rise above every situation. You will definitely achieve something.</h1>
