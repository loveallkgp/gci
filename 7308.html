<p>GCI please post this asap. I m a confused sperm and always will be. I met this guy 2 yrs back. Found him interesting. At that time I was not ready for anal, not even now. And he's a top and when I denied he was ok with it. He's a cool chap and decent. After that I called him twice and got to know that he got transferred. I felt bad. I won't say I felt for him that time. But i enjoyed his company. After 2 yes I found him again with a different I'd..Of course I have a diffrnt I'd now. I was so happy to found him . it took him some time to remember me. This time he was looking for frnds only, company only. He was clear from the begining. He's getting married by the end of the year. We met 3 times in 2 weeks. I started feeling for him. I didn't want to fall in love from anyone from these sites. I knew he's a busy person. And I was loosing patience. Started feeling insecure n jealous. I became demanding sort of. He sensed it. He asked whats wrong with me. I cudnt tell him. Coz first of all I kept telling myself - nahi nahi. I don't love him. I can't love him. I just want a frnd like him. I truly loved his company. And secondly bcoz I cud not hide it from myself. I thought if I express my felling for him I won't be having him in my life any more frown emoticon That scared me. He only had said that initially he too loved my company. I know I m not a good company. But he said that. I enjoyed long drives with him, listening to him. Lots of things we hav in common. But... Now. What has happened to me. I txt him 10times get 1reply. It feels bad. I had told him this. It seems he has taken me for granted now. And I told him this as well to which he kept silent. The kind of frnd I saw in him, I was wanting that only from these sites. But things hav changed. He avoids me. And main use jitna bhulne ki kosish karta hu won itna yaad ata hai. I can't block him on WhatsApp. Only enabled that - last seen thing. Coz every time I open WhatsApp I see his last seen. And get disappointed wen there is no msg from him. What i want now - more of his quality time, very often. What he wants- he says he'll meet me only wen he gets free time from his busy schedule. We stay in the same city. And have not met since 1 month or so. Friends... I know what u will say and suggest. I tried doing everything I cud do to forget him.. But tell me... 'how'.!!! frown emoticon N.B. #GCI . I love you. Plz don't be too harsh to me. wink emoticon tongue emoticon</p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks for ur love sweety...</h1>
<p>1- U have developed as a drag not as a mature guy. Curtail this trait of urs immediately.
2- U have become an over expecting bitch with no sense of understanding people's mind and heart. Learn some psychology dear.
3- He had been clear from the beginning as per ur words and now u want things to be moulded on ur side.....give me one valid reason to continue this..pls????
4- U want a romantic friend and that too on terms and conditions because of ur demisexuality maybe...and u in self-conflict won't solve the issue.
5- Start to let go of things where ur brain has been taught by the societal factors and ur internal thoughts that ur happiness is dependent on being with him only.....stop practising happiness with his company coz there is no reciprocation now.</p>
<p>P.S- U must understand that life will give u lemons and oranges both, it is upto us to make juice out of it or stinch it when we are squeaked by its droplets in our eyes.</p>
