<p>hello admins, here is a story of a guy, it's quite long.
i met him at a station, he was a good person , he was not a gay and we started meeting, these meetings were just done to share our personal stories, of our life but i knew him by his pseudonym. he and me met at top class restaurant but he had one problem and that was that he could not bear imperfection. for an example- he didn't like the clothes i wore, he hated my frayed jeans, worn-out jacket, shoes which were torn and so he took me to few shops which sold me designer goods and bought me best formal clothes, i was shocked, no one buys you clothes for free, right? but as i told you, he was a different person, i had to take great care in making my tie in a perfect equilateral triangle and my shoes had to spotless and not a single wrinkle or micro thread on my clothes, i asked him what was the need to do so, he told me that it was necessary, he can't bear to see people who wore imperfect clothes and didn't have proper dressing sense but he had to bear strangers because he can't buy clothes for everyone, he was indeed a strange guy, when i told stories, it was necessary for me to tell him in understandable format with proper grammar, food was another thing, he only ate organic,fresh food which had every spices in balanced proportion, he customized dishes too, everyday i would receive him out of that top class hotel with his Mercedes Benz . he was 10 times richer than me, where he worked, that place was fully furnished, he only used modern European furniture straightly imported from France and UK and the songs which he listened were only classics-Beethoven,Mozart,Hayden,Bach etc.
this person was just strange, not a mental patient..
so i'd happy if you would not give and funny responses or make fun of him... he told me many stories, like his great grandfather who suffered the miseries of partition and then he took part in indo-china war and how his father , who was working in USA saw 9/11 event happening in front of his eyes and i told him about my stories...it was a wonderful experience with him.</p>
