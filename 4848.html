<p>I feel like crying now , so I think its our fault to give power to modi government who just hates the rights of gay people and is pretty homophobic . if we would have voted for congress they are staunch opponent of modi goverment and also hates sectiom 377. we would have a great way ahead of ipc sec 377 to be removed . but I don think so jan28 is the day when we will get our rights. I think the right time would be after 5 more years . during the new govt formation :'(

<h1>GCI- Don't make opinions about modi before he says anything. It's true that Rajnath Singh, RSS and VHP are against homosexuality with ramdev as their spine but don't assume about him. What's disappointing in Modi's case is that he has been silent on the issue. No statement has been given from his side. Forget BJP, RSS and VHP. What I am waiting from this guy is to open his mouth and say something about the issue, which he is not doing at all.</h1>
