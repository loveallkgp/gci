<p>Overmorrow was the day when I saw u from a distance yet again after a gap of one and a half months. U had a very surprised yet plain reaction when u saw me. I never expect anything from u now though. I felt choked when I cried without any control on seeing u. U came to your room only to go back to your friend's house. But when you arrived I never felt even to see u once  because I had mourned that feeling. I kept myself busy and indifferent with your other pg mate. U went away trying as hard u could to get my attention. But what was there for me to see u??The way u left me for ur ex was not less than any cruelty, it lacked compassion. I never would had opposed you but its rightly said that we can understand a person better by the way they leave us. U want to know how am i?? Well then listen ..I was shattered..i suffered tremendously bcoz of the fact that u were inhumane and blind towards my feelings. I suffered loss of appetite, hair loss, erection problems and cried continuously at a stretch for about a month. It took very much of effort from my side to put myself back again. Now I am contented that I communicate with you via that diary which u gave me as a present on our first meet.Yes I write  in it whenever i Feel. I had gone to return your romantic novels which i never read. I cannot erase you from my life but I can surely wait for your memories to fade. U were never the ryt person for me to love ...i hope u remain happy with your ex again and never even remember me bcoz I have already considered u as dead and whenever i will feel i shall mourn for u!</p>
<h1>GCI- I shall wait for the other admins comments..this is deep!</h1>
