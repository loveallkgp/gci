<p>I was travelling in Delhi metro today from badarpur to mandihouse. It was around 4pm and the coach in which i was travelling was very crowded. A young man of almost the same age as mine (26 yrs), well dressed in formals came and stood right infront of the seat where i was sitting and listening to music on my phone (far left one). I don't know what happened to this guy...he suddenly started giving bad gestures...he started fondling and adjusting his dick over his trousers. I noticed that he was doing this occasionally after every 5 mins or so. He did this to the extent that now his dick was fully erect and it was clearly seen bulging outwards his trousers. I guess he tried to take advantage of the crowded metro. I tried to ignore but i couldn't. Finally he deboarded the train at Central secretariat, loosing the erection. While leaving he even tried to touch my fingers. Was he gay? I couldn't understand this situation...</p>
<p>btw..he was quite handsome and i liked him..but I couldn't gather the courage to look straight into his eyes when he was doing all this..i was feeling kinda embarrassed and my heart beat was rising.</p>
<h1>GCI- I leave this for the goodlooking guys here to answer!</h1>
