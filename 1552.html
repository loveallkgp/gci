<p>hi guys need some help and suggestions, i dont know yet if i am gay/bi or not. all i know is that sometimes i fantasize kissing men, doing those things with them (not sex) but oral.. i fantasize myself as bottom, and i get turned on, i masturbate with these thoughts, but i havent done any such thing in real life, i live in a boys hostel, i dont generally get turned on with boys around me, but when i see a hot guy, with cute smile, i know dat nd i wont mind if he kisses me..
i cross dressed for the first time when i was in 5th standard, used to cross-dress on a regular basis till 8th -9th std. being a girl, being treated as a girl really makes me happy, nd turnd on... whenever i watch porn i imagine myself as the girl (in straight porn) and as the bottom in gay porn.
I do not fall in love with boys, but i have fallen in love with a girls, but whenever i imagine sex, i imagine myself with a boy, and the whole idea of behaving as a girl and having sex with a guy, rubbin dicks turns me on, gives me an erection.
BUT again, I do not fall in love with guys!! i dont feel possessive for them or jealous or anything, may be this is because i havent met any gay/bi guy yet who is capable of loving me.. because i do wanna be loved by a guy and the idea of having a bf who loves me , feel good too, but all these are my imagination, nd fantasies dont have any experience in real life
i want you guys to comment and help me, if i am gay/ bi or not, i want to discover my sexual orientation , afterall i m almost 20 now
if there is someone, who is decent, educated, single, from ncr i even wanna try a relationship with a boy, nd see how it goes, try out my fantasies in real life.. so comment &lt;3</p>
<p>delhi</p>
<h1>Viv- Look munchkins, being a gay guy means that you are sexually, emotionally and romantically attracted to the person of the same sex. If you are a bi, then it has a wide spectrum of possibilities. I think you are in the initial stages of knowing your identity. You fantasize a lot about boys, shag to their thoughts, you cross dress, feel like a woman while watching straight porn, and you always imagine yourself with a boy. So, I think you are pretty much gay. Maybe even gay-er than me.</h1>
<p>And as for the last line, bleh to that.</p>
