<p>Hey Guys, 19, Delhi I am very ascertain about everything and highly ambitions. I wanted clarity in my life, about my orientation too. I have had sex with my male friends and I found fun and guilt at the same time. I even liked a girl, maybe it was love, I still think about her..donno. I m even confused about me being an extrovert or an introvert. I just wanted to tell, if someone is in teen years it's natural to be like this, don't tag anything on yourself, it's just level of confusion..give yourself time..let things be natural. I wanted it my way..so I made a fake account...even talked with few on my real account..all they were interested in sex (Guys no offences and no generalization, though I m cool with it, raging hormones :P). I developed attachment, some said I m not their age, some not their type... I don't worry anything now...if things are meant to spark they will naturally, yes I will put my step further if anything happens... so this have again turned me lonely... so I wrote these lines in the awesome Delhi Metro.. Serene, Pure...drizzling in the dense chord Every step in the haze of tangled thread of hearts A touch...A sight of yours, I long...longing for you In the unconscious..in the slips of tongue, I have Settled you Purple are you...I, a Pauper</p>
