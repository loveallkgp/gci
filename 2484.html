<p>well i too have a PG-related confession but please don't make fun of me...
actually i share my room with a guy, i am little chubby but tall and he is my senior , he is tall and his body shape is quite wonderful but he likes staying in boxers all day, so whenever he does that, i feel horney and shy and whenever we sleep, he hugs me from back while sleeping and puts his one leg over my thigh and gis hand on my abdomen and i again feel so horney, one day when i woke up at 3 am because i wanted to drink water, i found that his hand was on my genital and he was asleep tightly hugging me, so i turned around and hugged him too and then i kissed on his neck and then on his cheeks,eyes and i hugged him more tightly (but he was still deeply asleep). when i woke up next morning, he was bathing and he didn't react when he looked at me. i think he was in deep sleep and didn't know anything happened. yesterday when we both were sleeping, i was sleeping in a straight position, then he kept his leg again in my thighs , u could feel his genital beneath those boxers which were touching mine too and then he kissed on my cheeks and for whole night he kept his lips near to my cheeks and his natural smell was so wonderful, so i took his hand and started licking his 2nd finger and i licked it . i don't know if he is a gay and should i make a move? he talks all day about girls and i've got to know that he is quite popular among girls in our college.</p>
<h1>GCI- Ooh la la... sounds interesting. Do not make a move. Observe that to what extent he goes with all of this.</h1>
