<p>Hi People.
I am quite confident and proud of myself with what I got and what I have achieved in life so far. Mostly, I am kinda guy who buys whatever he likes without thinking about it twice. Sorry not boosting about myself if it sounded like that. 
I am a sikh bearded guy and quite often guys don't like me. Most of them are attracted to me just without the beard and turban on my head. Everybody got their like and dislikes and I respect that. But if you ever go on some dating websites then most of the profiles wound be like no sardars, etc. etc... Even to be penpals they want you to be clean shaved. I mostly go for guys with brains rather than no brains and all flesh. 
Some guys do see your pic and know that the other person is waiting for their reply but they mostly lack the decency to write words "Sorry nt interested". I don't understand why do most gay guys here do that. 
And the funny part is that their profile would read as something like "searching for soulmate" or "Looking for LTR" and after intro their first messages are somewhat like "top or Bottom" "u have place"  etc...  You all know the rest. I don't mind sex date or usual fuck buddies but say what you really after rather wasting someone else's time.
Sorry, it was more of ranting than confession and the persons intended get the message.
Thanks. No hard feelings.
Peace :)</p>
<h1>GCI : see i myself i am sikh guy but a non turbaned sikh . but i love beards . there are many guys outside india who prefer turbaned and bearded men . its their fetish .</h1>
<p>again its not that all men don't like turbaned men .. i have seen many asking for sikh guys ( on pr). </p>
<p>i have seen so many saying ( no fat guys . no aged men , no feminine men , no hairy men , twinks only , muscular men only , no cross dressers ) etc etc ,,.... but its everybody's personal choice .if they aren't attracted to particular type of person we can't force them </p>
<p>above all its about if love happens .if two people fall in love it won't matter to other if one wears turban , or has beard or  isn't mascular or don't look like calvin klien model.</p>
