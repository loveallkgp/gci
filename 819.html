<p>Hi guys here my first confession....i am 20 years old and my bf he 26 so we have been together for more than a year even though we had a long distance relationship but i trust and i love him so much .so we plan to move forward for this and we plan for getting married after my studies coz i will be graduate next year..he proposed me for marriage and i have accepted him to get married to him but the things is that there is no way for us that such thing will be happening in our country so....he said that we have to settled with him abroad but i didn't wanna stay far away from my parents but i wanna get married to him n i love him so much ...so please give some suggestions coz i didn't know what im gonna do now</p>
<h1>Viv- Aren't you a little bit young for marriage? Its a great thought but give it a few more years. And India is not yet a place for gay marriage. You do have to move abroad if you wanna live as couple. There will be too many complications here.</h1>
