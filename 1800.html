<p>I am regular reader of your columns and I thank you for your wonderful efforts to share n solve problems of our various brothers and giving such an wonderful platform. I am in a fix n really upset and need your suggestions to save my 7 year old relationship.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>          me 45 yrs Bisexual from chandigarh, sober sincere smart down to earth and very kind. I became committed with 28years old gay from chandigarh only 7 years ago and still continuing. When we became in relationship we deleted all our old contacts from gay world and even changed old numbers and deleted our PR n FB accounts. Reset our phones. My buddy is very innocent loving but very lazy and used to luxurious living. since last 8-9 months he is not paying serious attention towards me and I am not enjoying sex with him. till date we have been generally meeting every week  when nobody is at his place and i like passionate sex. I try to give my best to my partner in sex even if i cum first. We went to Manali specially for 4-5 days to have break from daily routine and enjoy but there also we hardly had sex as he was not in mood. When we planned trip then he was very excited. Similarly again when we are on phone then he seems desperate to enjoy but when i plan trip or when we meet then he is on grass root level of d interest. All this drove me broken from inside and i started feeling inside that I am not getting my due from him and the result is that I am loosing interest in him.

          I had stopped masterbation also to enjoy with him only on weekend. Full week i wait for our meeting but end result is depression due to his behaviour. Bcoz I feel hekeeps watching English movies and masterbates lot in my absence. As such when I am there he has no interest to discharge but I have.

          Recently he remained free at home for a week as nobody was at his home and he was all alone. I wished to spend a night with him but he did not called me and instead spent time with one of his school friend
</pre></div>


<p>Even he stayed with him too and this irritated me a lot. As such I am now again on FB and PR. I dated 2-3 guys orally but was not satisfied as i dnt like to hire room n hotels for such acts. Till i  get passionate sex, i am not satisfied.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>         Got involved emotionally only with 3-4 guys from FB also as people find me sincere and very intelligent guy. Even in my this age on this Valentine day I got 4 proposals to accept and being n commitment i had to refuse them. The moment he comes to know that I am doing all this, he will go into depression and may commit suicide. So as a moral duty I cant leave him also. But when i meet other guys, In heart of heart I feel that I am ditching him.

         Please advise me, what shall I do?? I shall be very thankful to you.

<h1>Viv- O.M.G.! Sir, first of all there is total lack of communication between the two of you. Maybe its the age gap or something else, that I don't know about. But if you talk about life related stuff, emotional stuff, then you should be comfortable about talking about sex! But at the end, it is turning toxic for you. I'd suggest that you should also talk about where your relationship is heading, whether you want a break or you wanna get separated.</h1>
<p>BTW, how can you say that he is being totally loyal to you? You seem like someone who is emotional, yet you couldn't help but had sex dates. And you think that he is staying true? He spent the night with a friend! As much as I have got, he won't feel bad at all if you'd tell him. But first just talk about whatever it is in your mind. It is the only key to the solution of problems that goes in relationships.</p>
