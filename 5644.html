<p>K i m gonna be making 10 confessions that pop in my mind first (trivial ones) -</p>
<p>1) When i first found out i was gay, i was 14, and surprisingly, i was too happy about it, I am a bisexual, and its not a fake cover that i have made, no, I am too proud to be gay, its so exciting everyday, I feel like I am different from the rest (evolved in a way), I really hate feeling like a sheep, </p>
<p>2) I wish Indians were more accepting , the problem is, In the west, people might be homophobic but in India, most of the people are not even homo-aware- I just mistakenly* saw an Indian mtv show where a guy was revealed as gay and everyone was like shocked as if they saw a ghost, they were showing their faces in Ekta kapoor style lol  (kya+ Kya + Kya) hahahaha, 
well that was the last time i watched indian mtv- i will stick to faking it ;)</p>
<p>3) I love YAOI :D</p>
<p>4) I always fantasize about having a sugar daddy, haha would never really do it in real tho, it scares me </p>
<p>5) This is my second confession :) and when people reply, i feel so good, :)</p>
<p>6) Im too kinky, its way better than good old "Sex"  :) like bdsm, spanking etc</p>
<p>7) I have often tried to meet people from online chats but never did it, it makes me so scared, what if hes a bad guy, 
what if hes a rapist, 
what if hes an undercover and i end up in jail.</p>
<p>i know i sound silly, but i cant help thinking about all this, wish there was a solution to this, I dont want a fuck buddy, just a casual friend, nothing serious, 
just because im gay doesnt mean im looking for sex - jeez </p>
<p>8) sometimes i feel ugly sometimes i feel beautiful, does it happen to all or is it just me? idk even in photos, my beauty varies, i think im just ugly :(</p>
<p>9) My hobbies are Rollerblading, skateboarding, painting, learning languages (4 now) , tv shows, songs, drinking and porn :D</p>
<p>10) Currently i am 19 and studying in Amity , Noida, 
and i sure as hell do not choose to remain anonymous.</p>
