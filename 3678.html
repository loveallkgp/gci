<p>Went with a guy today at his home. We started kissing each other then we remove other clothes, he wanted me to suck his cock but I asked him to suck mine first...he did and then I did, but I don't think I liked it much...then he want to have proper sex but I denied..he said ok. He said he will act like he is fucking..i said ok
After that he again wanted me to give him a blowjob..and with all these happening...i was thinking what the heck I am doing man, this is not me, why am I doing this?? 
After coming home, I even did not want to see my face in morror. This all was so disappointing. 
I don't think I am a gay material.(Not insulting anyone). Still supports #LGBT</p>
<p>And..i want your feedback too abt my sexuality</p>
<h1>GCI- Its not just about sex. There are other factors involved as well in your sexuality. Maybe, at that time you weren't feeling it or your attention could have been somewhere else. You definitely must be feeling some emotional change.</h1>
