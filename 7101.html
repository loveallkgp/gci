<p>hey..</p>
<p>i recently had sex with a guy with whom i already had sex a year ago.</p>
<p>he's 17 and I'm 20 .. but i came to know that he has become addicted to sex.. and has sex with random guys..
though i didn't take it seriously and went to his room as he called me..
at first we went for foreplay in his dark room.. slowly .. i was so hard on that i tried to fuck him... and then i told him to turn around.. i turned on my cell phone to see his ass to put my dick in his ass.. 
then i saw so many wounds, scars on his.. itchy thangs... i was scared so i didn't fcuk him.. and i started jerking off kissing him at same moment..</p>
<p>and after coming to my room.. i immediately took a bath with hot water..</p>
<p>so is it risky? will even i get those wounds? :/ ..  is it transmitted skin to skin disease?</p>
<h1>GCI- Tell him the same and save someones life rather than being selfish enough to save only of ur own!</h1>
<p>Moral of the story- CONDOMS ARE NOT OUT OF PRODUCTION IN THE MARKET!</p>
