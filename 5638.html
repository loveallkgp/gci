<p>Hello.. I'm in love with my best friend.. He cares for me alot but he's not gay and he also don't know that i'm gay.. We both share everything,. We even text or call each other while going anywhere.. We are same in everything.. We are friends from 1 and half year but its like we are friends from life.. The thing i get sad on is his girlfriends.. I feel very insecure when he talks about his girlfriends.. Its like he's only mine.. That moment i think of quitting my life.. Because i only love him.. Yes i understand that I should give him space on this.. But i don't understan d what should i do..? And if i tell him about being gay he will not leave me but his attitude towards will change definitely..</p>
<h1>GCI- No no no no... stop imagining things with him. He has girlfriends with an 's'. Better thing would be to stop expecting things from him. Honestly living in a fake world where he loves you would do you no good. Save yourself.</h1>
