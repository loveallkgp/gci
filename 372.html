<p>Juat wanted to share thia beautiful story..... Found it on Internet.....
I'm a straight 21 year old college student and have a very small group of close friends that I consider family; Im very open to them as they are to me. One of my best friends is an openly gay guy who is 20.</p>
<p>A week ago we where all enjoying a night in, having a few drinks and chilling. We got started on about relationships and such like how long our serious we were with old flames and things like that. We know our gay friend has never really been with anyone; he hasn't even had his first kiss yet. He kept just laughing about it and such. We then said that we would date him he he wanted as a joke and he laughed it off. I said that I would be lucky to have someone like him and the look i got; I've never seen him look so happy and hurt at the same time. He went very quickly and left a few minutes later. I thought I may of offended him or something so sent him a few texts but got no reply. He kept in touch with all our friends but not myself.</p>
<p>I went and knocked on his door; he had popped out the shower and answer the door in just a towel. The moment he say me he went very flush and almost upset. I asked him if something had happened between us but he just put on a fake smile and turned away, pretending everything was ok. I knew he was upset but gave him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>I sat down on the sofa when he came through, still in his towel and acting normal. Things were awkward and I asked him if he was ok. I got a very plain 'I'm fine'. I kept asking him and suddenly his eyes got teary again. Next thing I know is hes sitting on my lap and holding onto me. This was very out of character for him. His eyes looked so heartbroken and then he kissed me very intensely.</p>
<p>He confessed that he has had feelings for me for years but he didn't want to ruin our friendship so he kept silence but the loneliness has finally gotten to him. He said that he didn't want to keep it a secret anymore and wanted to tell me. He also said that he thinks that I would think of him as a creep but I know where he is coming from. He finally got of me and went to his room and asked through the door if he could be left alone.</p>
<p>After I left and met with our friends, they all told me that they too have known for years about his feelings for me. I was completely oblivious. Apparently the reason he hasn't been in a relationship is due to feeling unfaithful to me and that I am the only one to be close to him.</p>
<p>He is one of my oldest friends and we have been through so much together, when he lost his parents, when he came out, when he had financial problems we have been there for him. I can honestly say that as a person he is one of the most kind, trustworthy, open, loving caring people I have ever met. He is also very Beautiful as a man; as a straight guy I can say this truthfully without feeling insecure.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more i get confused. After all these years we are so close that I was unaware of how he felt. Thing is when he confessed I wasn't surprised or anything; my mind went blank completely and that kiss was so strange in a good way; it was almost felt like my first kiss again like many years ago.</p>
<p>When I think about him, it makes Sense why we are so close, we are practically in a relationship without the affection and lovey doveyness. My brain is telling me that hes just a friend and nothing can ever change that but my heart tells me that it makes perfect Sense for us to get together.</p>
<p>I have never been with a guy nor have i ever thought of it, I ended a 5 year relationship with my ex girlfriend last year and not been with anyone since but I'm too busy with college and work.</p>
<p>Last night I had a dream about us being together; eating together, snuggling on the couch watching TV; strange thing is we already do this in real life. But the main thing was when the dream turned sexual, I cannot get the picture of his Beautiful body and face when we where doing it.</p>
<p>I am not ashamed to enter a gay relationship as it may be the best thing I've ever done but I don't want to ruin our friendship as I know I will never to go back to what we were.</p>
<p>I don't know if my feelings for him are true or if I'm just creating feelings for him; it seems wrong and right at same time.</p>
