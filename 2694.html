<p>Hi Guys, I'm 21 years old. I used to have gay feelings for the past few years, but i thought it will go away later. I tried to convince myself that i'm bi- sexual, but these thoughts used to keep worrying me. I met 3-4 guys for fun, but always refused sex. My whole life was affected. I developed an introvert character and as a result lost some of my good friends.  I finally accepted myself as a gay recently, since then I've been happy with myself. I still feel like i want to meet guys. But i'm not interested in sex. I like watching gay porn, but it's usually the foreplay ( like undressing, kissing, hugging) i enjoy most. The sex really disgusts me. I also don't like questions like are u top or bot? Cock size? etc.. I have a few oddities- I get horny seeing boys in low waist jeans showing their underwear brand and love finding out if my friends are wearing a vest (banian).  My attraction stops there, never had any sexual feelings. I have never been attracted to a single girl.
All these are making me wonder if i'm gay? Are there others like me?</p>
<h1>GCI :no its totally normal that you feel like this and so many other people are there like you .not everyone has strong sexual feelings . some people don't like sex , they are in less no but worldwide there is a big group of people who are not interested in sex but love bodyplay , hugging and other physical affection which can't be considered as sex.</h1>
<p>second thing,  might be its is related to your psychology . you are not interested in sex maybe because  you aren't yet in love with person . when you will be in love with person you body and mind might open up for sex. 
so many people feel this way .</p>
