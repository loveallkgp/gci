<p>Hi everyone, I am 23 transgender. I have been living my life like a boy till now and nobody knows that I am mentally a girl. I have adapted myself to pretend like a boy, I am working in a reputed MNC and doing quite well professionally. I was mocked a lot during my school for being effeminate but I leaned from that and started acting masculine from my college which continues till today. Due to this I was never able to be comfortable with anyone and I turned out to be a loner, which gave me a lot of time to do what I wanted to do. I think now I can finally afford a sex reassignment surgery. Is there anyone here who has gone through the process and is willing to give me ten minutes of your time, please comment, I will personally ping you and ask for your number, or have a chat with you. I want to know the entire details like hormone replacement therapy, breast implant etc, the time and money, it takes etc. I would prefer someone from pune or Mumbai, so that I can consult the sake doctors too. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, this is something serious. I honestly cannot tell you about the medical cost of the surgery and everything. You need something concrete and something which can really help you out. I will try to find some good sources for you. For now you can visit this website(I'm sorry if you have already visited it).</h1>
<p>www.genderreassignmentindia.com</p>
<p>Still you need someone trustworthy who can tell you about the experiences and guide you to the best of your interests. </p>
<p>I'd suggest you to get in contact with another someone on Facebook. Her name is Kritika Singh and she has been through the same. I hope I provided you with enough material. I am sorry for my ignorance on this matter. I will improve myself. Have a nice day.</p>
