<p>20,
On 6 oct i reviled my gay identity to my cousin sis who is 4 yrs oldr to me....after listening she's said its ok..u accept what god made u and she'll support me to in evry moment in my life....
Now the thing is that..she want that i need to change as i m the only child of my parent ...as it would be a grt disastrous in future(marriage time) as i m belonging to christian family  ....she said that i should start dating girlz ....bt..i m totally confused, insane that how a guy who loves girlz bt not in sexual sense culd date girlz .....(once i did bt of no use) 
and i want to hv a life partner of my own choice....so guyz suggest me what should i do? Should i listen to her or just take my own ways...?? #totally_confused</p>
<h1>confused_guy</h1>
<h1>GCI- If she said that she accepts you and will support you, the words should mean something. Its not like you get accepted at one minute and then asked to date or fuck girls the other minute. Besides thinking about how disastrous it could be for the family as you are the only son, she has to think how disastrous it could be to do what you are not into at all. Its her that has to understand and increase her thinking aspect. Make her understand this.</h1>
