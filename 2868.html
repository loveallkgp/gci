<h1>GCI- Listen, whatever happened you brought it upon yourself. From the very beginning he made his stand clear. Yet you were the one who was forcing him to be with you. He accepted you as you are and even knew how you felt. Yet he had no problem with it. You failed to understand that he was straight and you were just being a fool(sorry to use this word but I have no other word) to continuously badger him. And after that you started ignoring him. The best you could have done was keeping your feelings under control by thinking that you two were never meant to be. If you have a best friend, that doesn't mean you have to go all flat over him in love. If you want to be with someone then get a gay guy. You want to make amends? Approach him and say him sorry for your behavior and also say that you will keep yourself in control.</h1>
<p>PS- Its band and not the thing you wrote. -_-</p>
