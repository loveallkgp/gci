<p>I always struggled with my attraction to men and asked why Allah made me this way. I was fortunate that I never touched another male no matter what the attraction. Then one day saw the light of our Holy prophet, peace be upon him and he told me that Allah doesn't give us a test we cannot pass. I was made this way so I could save evil people who were not born gay but became gay due to lust and sin. My life was to save such sinners from Hell and make them straight again and convince them never to act on gay feelings and to get married like I have. I have so far turned 5 people straight and feel like my divine purpose is getting fulfilled. Do let me know if you need help to overcome this.</p>
