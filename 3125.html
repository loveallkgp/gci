<p>Hey Admin I m confessor #2885 (I hope U will know me.... If U dont pls dont give snappy comments.... :-) ) I m in the group now... I think that this is a huge step for me... I would like to meet new people around and put my past behind me... He was an impossible dream after all...
I was, lately very confused, whether to join the group or not... But seeing U guys having all the fun made me want to join you guys and have fun... I thank the Admin very much for being such a positive force in my life... I have even started talking with few guys here... They were great, I gotta tell, the people here are great and all the credit must go to u I guess.... I would ve thanked u personally, but I think contacting u would be impossible and this is the only way to make u know... I m glad I found this page.
I feel excited and happy after a long time... I dont know if i should feel better about this but people here have problems more fatal than mine and this page made me realize that there are more things worth worrying about than some silly boyfriend issues....
Admin(s) - u are doing a amazing work and I hope u dont stop it. I would be grateful if u would keep this page as alive as it is now, forever. Again Thanks and a big Thumbs Up.... </p>
<h1>GCI- Much thanks for the appreciation! I won't snap at you! :D BTW, I do feel nice when people come up here and say that in one way or the other, their lives have been made easy through this page. The credit goes to the members also as they are equally valuable. The page won't be stopped at all, be assured for that. Infact, I do have some special plans for us in future. But that's gonna take some years because I have to be financially settled. Thanks so much again for your words. :)</h1>
