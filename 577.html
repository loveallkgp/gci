<p>Admin i recently heard that my guy who rejected me went and proposed a girl right after he rejected me..and that girl rejected him..but he was not depressed as i am..one day i was about wear blue shirt and blue pant..but unfortunately my pant is wet.so i went in black dress.but that day mu guy was wearing the same blue pant and blue shirt..e He was looking at me the entire day ..he tries to come stand next to me but left..i was shovked to see him in the dress colour that i was supposed to wear that day..even nature doesnt want us to be together</p>
<p>I want him</p>
<p>I couldnt forget him</p>
<p>Wat should i do.</p>
<h1>Viv- Okay, this "nature doesnt want us to be together" is a very lame reason to believe in something and get sad. He is a partner hopper. He ditched you and went to a girl but was not depressed after he got rejected. Even if he gets back to you, there will always be someone else he could jump on to. So the thing you can do is to let him run into the wild while you smoke cigar on the porch while having sips of the best quality wine. In short, enjoy your being single time and wait for someone WORTHY.</h1>
