<p>People say i am stupid, i look ugly, my body's shape is so strange that many people look at me with those eyes which make me feel bad. I don't like meeting people, i just spend my whole time in my room reading books, i don't know what else to do, my intrest and preferences are so different from others that no one befriends with me. I wany to be a writer, i want to write stories and novels based on love, teenagers and family. I consider myself gay but i want to write novels based on heterosexual love but i will write few novels on homosexual love. I am soon going to join 
college.</p>
<h1>GCI : see books are lifeless friends . its good to be in company with some good books but aren't they cutting you out from real world. and that staying in room all day and keeping with the books will only give you strange body ..for all reasons . go out and do cycling and do some exercising . keep your body as much active as much you use your brain . no need of friends but keep hello hie's with people . don't share your insecurities with others .whatever people say is none of your business . you shall find beauty in your own self .</h1>
<p>and best of luck for your writing career . you know people who get mistreated write  wonderful stories ...as they are based on reality and true face of ugly world .</p>
