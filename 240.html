<p>Hi guys i'm a bisexual. And my best friend who is straight knows it. [He is the one i want to love. I want to have sex with. I want to have a relationship with. But as he is straight, i am not doing anything.]</p>
<p>Now real thing. He is so possessive about our friendship! He don't like when i get close to other friends. He stop talking to me for silly reasons. But come again like nothing has happened. He often seams jealous with me being close with other girl or a guy. We often ask each other to suck each other's dicks as a joke (most of the time, i'm serious. but he take it as a joke). Now i am confused, whether he is actually straight? or bi? Can friends be possessive? Pls help me out.</p>
<h1>Viv- Yeah, straight guys can be possessive too. Its not unheard of. Just do not take any step that could jeopardize your friendship. Otherwise who knows, he could be gay too cuz no one is perfectly straight! :p</h1>
