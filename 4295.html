<p>I was afraid of losing him. He was very special to me. I was going through a difficult phase at that time when he came in my life. He knew everything about me. He always tried to be there for me. He was like my world at that time. I used to be with him everyday for 5-8 hours bunking my college classes too. I really loved him a lot. I know he might be reading this today, I just want him to know one thing - "Both of us were responsible for our break up someway or the other. Its been 4 years now, I still remember each and every moment we had spent together. It took me 2 years to move on, while it took you just a week to get laid with other guys falling in love with them. I dont hate you. But I can never forgive you 'cause you had made me sexoholic and it took me years to get back to the normal life again"..</p>
