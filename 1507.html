<p>A sweet mrng all d wonderful creations of God On dis Universe..!</p>
<p>Pls. Suggest me admin...
me 45yrs old frm chd. I am very God Loving, emotional, helpful loving, gud lkg n sincere. I never got love in my life. In childhood used to think of suicide many times but since i know Its a biggest sin &amp; literally heavy punishments,so never commited. nvr wanted to marry but did not knew reason as i was not aware of my sexual orientation n desires. came to know when internet came. Lot many ppl are my frnds and lot many want to be.</p>
<p>I came into relationship 7 yrs ago with 22 ys old guy frm chd only.n we were committed and deleted all our previous contacts n other related materials. even i hv some gd frnds frm dis line with whom i am just frnd and no sex &amp; they were annoyed too on my cut off..
we used to meet once a week due to working problems. 4-5 yrs passed very peacefully n enjoyable. he is BOT n very innocent n simple BUT very handsome. Even i completely stopped masterbating (which i Love doing very much) Slowly n slowly I realised dat he is not able to satisfy me sexually. I told him also so many times but he was least bothered. Its my kind nature that I dnt want to force any1 for anything n want dat person shld realise himself his duty n responsiblity for our relationship nd we must have passionate sex whenever we do, n nothing if we dont do. but when we r doing n ur partner is not gvng 100% I started feeling it in my heart. bcoz it was repitition. may be he must be masterbating too much in my absence n when we are together, he is just obliging me doing sex to make me ejaculate.Mostly he has place, so every weekend we used to be desperate for meeting n whenever he has place, he wld call me. slowly it decreased n time increased from weekly to months, adding to my blows.
Ultimately i again checked in PR n FB for nyc guys. i dnt like sex seekers but a gd cooperative frnd to discuss,share n more. met 3-4 guys also n had orals. In my heart its itching me bcoz i am cheating my frnd but i am helpless bcoz i am not getting my due from him.. What shld I do?? Why do relations die slowly??I am so upset n really dnt kn what to do?? My ex is repeatedly asking me to join him again but i am not able. Bcoz with him i enjoyed fully but he ditched me by meeting other guys as he is in dli.</p>
<p>Generally we dnt get our drm guy due to mismatch of likings, age place etc etc. i do get like minded guys but all want sex first. Its also dere that if u sex in first 2-3 meetings then ok otherwise u r just gud frnds..</p>
<p>Plz guide me what shld i do? I hv too much sex in me. I cant leave my bf also as he will go in depression then. he loves me lot but not able to satisfy me physically. he is too lazy n indecisive.i dnt wanna cheat him. PLz help..</p>
<p>$ ABBY : see i won't call you cheater . in straight realationships men start cheating because their wife's stop satisfying sexually . then men often go look outside for sex . which is very common . 
in your case its same . and their is other thing too.. have you ever thought about it or not i don't know.... your bf .. does he still find you attractive ??? i mean you said 45 ... age is just a number but as you are into your work do you have time for your health ?? do yopu think you afre still appealing ?? 
maybe he isn't calling you for sex , coz either you don't apeal him anymore or you might not be doing sex right ( often tops know how get satisfied but never care about their bottom lover if he is enjoying it or not ) . i mean come on if i have a bf like calvin klein model ( just giving example of sex appeal not wanting anybody to look like that ) i would call him daily for sex .. isn't it 
so just go and talk to him about these things . there might be possiblity that he might also be cheating on you ( maybe i said ). talk to him everything you think and ask what he thinks and what his problems are . if he enjoys it with you or not . how to make your rtealationship better?? 
if things workout its good otherwise both part ways .but again you are already 45 , if you have a relationship which you think can work make it work . he can get guys but you will soon hit 50 you must get serious and settle with one . which i think . ONS's  are last options . sex is human need . i understand you .</p>
