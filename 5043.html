<p>Yesterday i met a random guy through some app. I am a bisexual, i found a guy who is straight. I didnt have intention to have sex or anything but i was just looking for someone to talk out of boredom. We started chatting. It was all normal. We talked about education and stuff. I was getting bored so i tried to escape from the chat. But he didnt let it go. He kept the conversation going. After sometime he asked me if i have ever had sex? I said yes and we started talking about sex. We only talked about straight sex. He was very much interested in talking about sex. He asked me about my experience. I shared it in brief. He was so horny because he has never had sex. We slept after that. Today morning he messaged me and he was seeming so curious about sex again. He asked for some tips of masturbation. I gave him some. To which he said i am not giving him proper reply. Out of fun, i said, ab tuje video record karke bheju kya? To my surprise he said yes. He insisted me to send him a video of me masturbating. I was shocked. I said you are kidding. He said no he is serious. I escaped saying ill send u video some other time. After sometime he said he want to masturbate with me over chat. I agreed. We did it. We exchanged couple of pics of us masturbating.</p>
<p>Now i have some questions for all of you. Is he really straight? Does straight men like to see dicks of other men? Does straight men like to masturbate with other guys? Is he a bi-sexual or he was just horny?</p>
<p>If he is a bi, i can take a step forward and we can have fun.</p>
<p>ps. I cant ask him directly.</p>
<h1>GCI- He can be anything but definitely not fully straight.</h1>
