<p>bring gay i always get nervous when i hav to talk to male guys or when i have to b guys....since to others i m completely a boy...so i have to sit wid boys in class....i hav to stay wid boys in hostel......its so nervous feeling for me to me wid guys everytime.....its obvious dat when we hav sexual attraction for some we dont share dat comfort level.....just like a girl dont feel comfortable to spend all d time wid boys....being gay i feel d same.....but to others i m a complete boy....so i hv to b wid boys only.......but my heart is like dat of a girl though m physically like a boy.....so i feel comfrtable wid girls as i hav no attraction for girls.....thus i have to suffer frm depression and nervous breakdown every time......i feel like commiting suicide as well....bcos i feel so lonely and alone.........</p>
<h1>GCI- You have to decide if you are gay or a transgender. If you are okay being a boy and you like boys, you are gay. But if you are a boy and feel like that of a girl from within, you are a transgender. Now, liking doesn't mean that you have to be a girl even if you are gay. Don't consider gender as two separate extremities. Gender identity and biological sex of a person can be same and can be different.</h1>
<p>Apart from this, honey I know how you feel, I stay with straights, My class has typical straights guys from various parts of the world, in my college hostel I had to stay with straights and I know how suffocating and lonely it can get. So don't take tension and do not think of suicide. You are not alone in this because many people go through the same stage. I wonder that you have been on this page and you never found any confession regarding your situation that can help you think otherwise? Well, stay the way you are. You are awesome in your way. :)</p>
