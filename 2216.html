<p>hey everyone. .
okay I ws about to have my exam nd I ws standing outside da hall, revising my notes. Suddenly out of nowhere, comes a really cute guy and starts talking with me. he asked about my college and year. fortunately he was in the same year but a different college. He even shook hands with me and introduced himself. Under normal circumstances I wud have conversed wid him but at that moment I was all freaked out due to the exam. so I got back to my notes. I dunno how he felt. but while I was writing at hall, I kept thinking of him and turning back to catch a glance of his face. I finished my paper as quick as flash in just an hour and waited outside the hall for him. but he just wouldn't come out. I waited for about 1 and a half hour and then left with my friends. coz they were feeling it odd for me to stand there.
I checked for him on fb, based on info he gave me. luckily I found him. I sent him a req. he didn't accepted. I messaged him regarding our meeting, but he just denied each and every detail. finally I apologised him for considering him some other guy and cancelled the request.
God I felt so humiliated. I just feel that, if it wasn't meant to happen, then why did it even start?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well you have to know that every cute guy who comes to talk with you doesn't come with a motive to start something with you. Jeez!</h1>
