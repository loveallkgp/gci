<p>Dear admin,
This is my first confession and am such a person who doesn't like to confess instead i take the problem as a challenge to solve it by myself, from last two days am facing a typical problem and it concerns to every person out there irrespective of sexuality, as i always read the rampant over finding a decent gay friend over internet, here what happened when i try to befriend with people, in my 25 years of lifetime all the person i came across i analyzed that there are three kind of people (behavioral) in world,
1. who are fun and easy going, genuine, listener, and down to earth and take any comments as humorously and answer it humorously without getting hurt. Very rare species :P
2. attention seeker, would create any cock and bull story to get your attention, they dont even listen themselves while they were bluffing.
3. Easily insulted, ignorant, pompous, lives in vain, egoistic, think themselves as the center of attraction and thinks that people are so jealous of their self proclaimed achievements that all they say is to insult them, they are spreading like virus. :X</p>
<p>am gonna put some limelight on those 3rd species
I am always for friendship, dont need a sex buddy, already in serious relationship with my bf from last five years, thing is that i want to talk with other gay guys and want to be a friend for them, today something strange happened or maybe you can tell me who's fault it was!
first it start as normal hi and hello, we share qualifications
next i asked abt his hobbies, all his hobbies was directing him as a huge art lover, so as humorously i told him, it would be better if he had chose art as his career , instead of mtech,
then he himself told me that he is gonna pursue art school after his mtech,
so all i tell him that you should have pursue art since start, now ur mtech quality will be a waste, and i have my reason why i told him that,
see as a commerce student i did project which one includes abt how mba is so overrated in India, how Indian education system, payscale system is different from other countries, every tech, med student goes for mba, even the iitians , and the reason behind is money, but in other countries every section of people get equal money and their segregation system is diff than ours, and based on his qualification and mine, i thought maybe it is a right conversation to get acquainted. But he took my comment as an insult and became all hyper, start to get defensive by telling he is a very meritorious student, he was an iitian and got call from iim, and i was just flabbergasted what the hell happened? why people cant just get the humor behind it, why people have to be so egoistic about their achievements, didnt history teach them nothing? how are they suppose to be friends with other when they have the attitude like this?
if you can study the matter, you can give your own opinion about this, all my life i made my attitude neutral and calm, but he left me feel guilty about myself and i dont even know was that a really very rude of me to say to him what i said? and i request every guys around here, pleasure never take something so serious, play with humor, sometimes people are sarcastic, may answer you as a slapstick, but instead of being defensive you should try to find the humor inside them, otherwise you will be just some boring and rude guy.</p>
<h1>Viv- LMAO! You made him the butthurt guy.. But was it really a humor that you said? I think not. It was a genuine thing to say and totally honest. Its his mistake that he took it in a wrong way because of his egoist attitude, not yours. If he thinks so highly of himself, sadly he hasn't seen the rock bottom ever in his life. But you know there is a think called karma. It makes balance in everyone's life. You don't feel guilty at all. We are all bhed bakri in this education field in India. Some accept the fact and change their branches while some still be bhed and bakri and blindly follow the herd and certainly he is also. Forget it like a bad dream and enjoy your talking with other people who can understand what you want to say.</h1>
