<p>Hey Admin....</p>
<h1>Viv and #Abby you guys are doing a great job here....</h1>
<p>Thanks to you both that you guys are helping other people... :)
I have my one classmate and he is my best friends....
when I met him first time when my college just started he was single...
and slowly we came closer and I came to know that whenever he make a GF he just get fed up and just break up...
He is so cute and handsome that I just fallen for him however when I thought that he is A straight guy I just changed my plan and started to give him less attention but now I feel that he is trying to come close to me mentally as well as physically(AS IN HOLDING HAND, KEEPING HIS HAND ON MY THIGHS and EVEN HE COME VERY CLOSE WHILE TALKING TO ME) and when I felt that he is trying to come close to me I recalled all the things about him that he never keep a GF for a long and even he is a virgin even when he got many chances with girls(THESE THINGS WE SHARE AS WE ARE BESTIES... :)) and just cuz of this I feel that may be he is too a homo and ma be he is not aware of his sexuallity...
what should I do for this??
Should I go and tell him about me and tell him that I like him and may be then he ll too feel the same???</p>
<h1>Viv- Ooh la la! Thanks buddy :* Btw, you know what it is like with some straight guys? When they can't find a girl, they always turn to their male peers. That's what I see in your case. Although his sexuality can be questionable. You do not necessarily have to tell him anything. Just go with the flow and let him touch you wherever he wants. And when you are in the real deal with the open curtains, you can ask him the truth. ;)</h1>
