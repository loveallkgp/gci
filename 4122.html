<p>24 m gurgaon,</p>
<p>Feeling bit low today... so putting all my feelings here.
I moved here (in gurgaon) 3 yrs back. For 2 yrs, i didn't care much about relationship or sex. But, from past 1 year, i felt so low emotionally and also my urges for having physical intimacy is also getting out of my hands. I spent numerous number of hours, on internet, on PR, on fake fb accounts.... talked to millions of ppl out there, but all in vain..... still single, still alone........</p>
<p>Throughout this journey, i felt close to few ppl.
First one, says he can't go in relationship with me..... but can stay frnds... that too... long -distance frnd.......
Second one, says he loves me... though i know he dont mean it, he never call me.... but whenever i calls him, he says he loves me...... we met once.... But on bed, i come to know, he is a pure ass lover.... whereas, i m not bottom .... and not into anals........ so, that was bit awkward.... he still in touch... &amp; he still says he loves me..... ughhhhh
Third one came, he says i treat u like my younger bro... lets be frnds &amp; hv sex.... no relationship.... we met.. start making out.... but i get uncomfortable, and stopped in between the act.... he tried really hard to convince me.... but damaged has been done... and my mind was just not ready.. so, kicked him (not literally) out of my bed.... we still talk.... &amp; he still says he would love to fuck me.... if i want to........ ughhhhh
Fourth one came, he claims that he fell in love with me... when he heard my voice at very first tym........ then he claims he love me madly........ then he claims he love me more than his life... and if i said no, he is gonna die.......... and then after my "No", he suggest, just hv sex with me once, so that i can forget u................ R u kidding me????
Fifth one came, we talk ...... &amp; we talk again.... our opinions just hit it off....... we talk more....... and talk a bit more..........and then our talking became a routine........ we talk for mnths........... and then he is gone.. without even uttering a single word.........</p>
<p>so, m here still single .... still alone..........
making my mind to get ready to marry a girl of my parent's choice.......
i just want a companion .. to share my sorrows &amp; joy........ sex was never a priority.... it never is...
Why it is so difficult ?? so hard ?? are my expectations r bit too much ?? or is there some fault in me ??</p>
<h1>GCI- Yes because you are seeing a potential partner in all of them. If you have expectations, make a list of them that these are the things you want in your partner. Stop expecting from everyone.</h1>
<p>And if you are a 100% gay then your marriage with a girl will be a big disaster. Sex may not be a priority for you but it will be pressurized upon you by your wife and your family. Kyuki bacha to karna hi padega na. What will you do then? Don't be swayed in emotions. Think wisely.</p>
