<p>I feel sad that i am poor.
I don't regret being poor because i am but because people kind of discriminate against me in my college.
If you are a poor, no one likes to talk to you, no one is interested in your interests. Everyone likes to befriend rich and attractive people having model-like looks and wearing stylish clothes.
No one likes to befriend a poor, average looking, not so stylish guy and that hurts!
Otherwise, i know that its no one's fault if i am poor but the reaction people gives - it just hurts!</p>
<h1>Viv- Well you feel bad and that gives them satisfaction. Next time try not to give those dyed eyed, uphill, rich ass bitches the satisfaction they need. Can't we really judge people by the way they think? I mean there are too many dumbos out there. And your college people are certainly the one.</h1>
