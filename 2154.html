<p>Big hello #GCI iam lesbain basically from Nagaland state. I have a lesbain spouse we are together for almost 6 months. At this stage we are madly in love with each other, we are even planning to get married after our graduation but the think is we are from same clan and as per our tradition and law two people of same clan are not allow to get marry. Ofcourse being lesbain or gay is also regarded as taboo. But one day or the other our family will find out and there is highly a chances we might even abandon from our society. I need proper and acurate advice. Please help :'( I couldnt find an suitable page so i drop in here. Your participation in recommending some appropriate L page or side will be highly appreciated. Thank you</p>
<h1>GCI : see if she loves you and you love her besides of her being a lesbian ... i don't think there is any bigger law then love . so marry the you love.</h1>
<p>i don't know traditions in nagaland and behaviour oor culture there .. but we are all indians and somewhere somehow our traditions are same . in punjab we can't marry in same cast as we are denoted as brothers and sisters in same caste . but so many guys are marrying each other . 
even here people are marrying their cousins too..  which is still okay to me .. well if its your cousin from outside your family tree .</p>
