<p>Hey admin Hws u hope ur doin fyn
idk whether dis a a confession a query or a voice of a broken heart lol
let's come to the point
Recently I've been in a relationship wid a guy frm ahmedabad very careful handsome n my typ of guy he was. wen I proposed him he denied n den after few days he came back n asked me to be in relationship wid him I accepted I was so happy n thnkful to god Cuz he bring my love back
while having a relationship I wanted him to talk to me the whole day den after several days he started ignoring me less messages no phone calls no nothing there was a guy in his life he was his ex they were in a relationship since 1.5year
even knowing that hi still love his ex I accepted him without any hesitation
I thought he'll love me as he'll forget him idk Whts exactly he was seeking frm our relationship he used to get angry on me wen I didn't reply but wen it comes to me he started arguing I asked him wht does he want but everytim he answered like no one would understand him dis behaviour was totally shocking n strange to me Cuz dis was my first relation I loved him fm bttm to top den he said he don't want dis relation anymore I asked him why he said I thought u could be my bf but u r not like my bf
he was so moody he used to admit his love whenever he wants but wen tried to do he get angry saying m out m bzy blah blah blah
day after days we talked less n it results less conversation more misunderstandings
we broke up 2 days ago I cried a lot for him I got depressed I lost my attention on studies
I still want him to be my partner Cuz I'll always love him till d last breath of my life but I've accepted that I picked up a wrong lover forgetting him is a big deal for me hope everythings gonna be fine
I everyone gonna tell me to move on n forget him but forgetting ur true love is not that easy too</p>
<p>and dis is the same guy I confessed abt previously</p>
<p>he left me singing
I can't make you love me if you don't </p>
<h1>GCI- Points to be noted-</h1>
<p>1) He was not over his ex.
2) He was comparing you to his ex.
3) He ignored you.
4) He didn't pay you much attention as you paid him.
5) The ultimate line is "no one can understand me" and he said that</p>
<p>Whoever says that line, they don't even understand themselves. When you don't understand yourself, you don't know how to present your thoughts and how can you expect anybody else to understand you? </p>
<p>Anyways, leave him alone to his thoughts. He needs the time. Meanwhile, watch Tom and Jerry and laugh.</p>
