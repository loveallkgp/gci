<p>Gay, 18.
Well, Me and my mom are not on good terms with each other. I'm gay and a hardcore liberal, She is conservative and sometimes supports communism ( :P ). So, I am still in closet, just to remove all sterotypes from her mind and encourage a better understanding of all LGBT community, I started discussing LGBT issues.
Then she asks 'am I gay'? and I'm like 'No! Just a human rights supporter'.
'ok'
'so, mom do you know who gays are'
'yes, men born with gender abnormalities'
'No no mom, they are those men who are perfectly male and they can only fall in love with men'
'really'?
'yes mom, do you know, recently, a transgender woman became a principle of a college, even the CEO of apple.Inc. is gay and so is the Luxembourg prime minister'
'oh...I know these people only reveal their sexual orientation when they acheive a higher post in society'
'No mom, it's not necessary'
'You don't need to support them. Don't even utter the word 'gay' in front of your father, he'll kill me and you and won't give you money for acdemic purposes'
'Mom but...'
'yes. I know everything about these people, I know they use black magic and voodoo dolls to turn others gay'
'WTF'?!
'Yes yes, I know everything'
'Mom, I've already told you that people are born gay. It's the matter of sexual orientation and nobody can change others' sexual orientation'
'No No, I've seen that movie in which gangs of transgender oppress people and carry out large scale illegal activities'
'Mom but that was just a peice of fiction'
'No No, I know everything'.
'Mom but..'
'Don't support these people, police will send you to jail'
'Mom I'm a human rights supporter, they are human too, you should encourage me to support people and their rights'
'I've been through this phase as well, when I wanted to be a superhero and rescue women from the gangs who are into this business of human trafficking but you can't deal with evil forces, if you support LGBT, you'll just attract hate, people will tag you gay and that's gonna ruin your career'
'what?!'
'Yes yes, You should first achieve your dreams, get a job, marry a girl and then you're free to support anyone you want'
'I'm not going to marry, plus I'll move out and live separately once I am economically independent'
'OMG! (Hayo rabba!) These people have affected you. you are following American way of living, you were never like this, how dare you. Don't tell me you're an ally and a part of LGBT group'
'I have not even met any gays, what are you saying, this is my personal choice'
'I don't care'</p>
