<h1>GCI- So it's a lesson for you to never take that step which you will regret later. You took the word "break up" very lightly, and now you are facing the consequences. You both got that bad blood between you, so unless you apologize about everything that you did, it cannot go. One of you has to let go of the ego and be open about the feelings.</h1>
