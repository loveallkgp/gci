<p>you know why i hate this page partly because of you but after seeing your reply i knew i am just being a jerk but after reading the comments i realized i had a lot of tension in me. i am seeing a doctor thank you Mayank but there have been comments calling me a bitch ignorant or whatever. To put my views as simple as possible sometimes you reply in a very crude way after some confessions and that makes you a judgemental and thats the last thing we should be .You should better know how many scared indian homosexuals opt for medical and illegal conversion techniques and thats because of the stereotype of the gay nymphomaniac. every body commenting and "confessing" here is a scared homosexual with a fake id who possibly wants a one-night stand and i was just putting it out in as brutally as possible and you know there are more than one type of closet.I just want to be me just me who likes guys.</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh yes honey, I am rude sometimes. Everyone is rude these days. But one thing is for sure that I have never crossed my limits. Yes I have gone over the top only for those who deserved it.</h1>
<p>You are telling me that I am being judgmental. Again, everyone is judgmental. By calling everyone as a "scared homosexual with a fake id who possibly wants a one-night stand" is something called being judgmental as well. So you are like everyone else here. Have a good day.</p>
