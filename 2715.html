<p>Hello admins and everyone. I am a straight guy and want to confess something about a terrible mistake I made. I had a very good friend when I was in engineering college and we were roomies. We instantly hit it off when we first saw each other and with time our bond grew. We knew each others deepest secret. Of course he never told me that he was gay but I could judge his eyes out and I also saw some gay pics in his phone. At that time I found it very uncomfortable. We were very fond of each others company and sometimes we used to cuddle while sleeping. He never made any advances to me but there was always some restlessness in his eyes whenever he saw me. It was like he wanted me for himself but he never said something. His actions spoke. He was too much possessive and interfered too much. I became annoyed and got in contact with guys who were more fun loving and played football. My roomie never had sporty intentions. With time my friendship grew with them and my roomie was feeling distressed. He tried to talk with me and many times he cried but I called him saala chipku and left him. But after a certain time he stopped giving me any attention. He became that guy whom you meet for the first time though I could see the sadness and the pain of betrayal in his eyes. I know I did wrong because he was a best friend to me and the new friends that I had made me bunk classes, spend money and play more video games. The result was that I was left with 15 suplies when my degree ended. Meanwhile he got other well deserving friends who liked his company.</p>
<p>Now here I am sitting at home with my burden of my suplies and he is in canada doing his MS course there. I know I did wrong and for that I have reaped. I just wanted to say sorry to him for whatever I did. He may have a fake profile with which he could see this confession.</p>
<p>Wherever you live my friend, I always wish the best for you. I don't deserve your friendship and for the mistakes I made, I am terribly sorry.</p>
<h1>GCI- I'm glad that you feel guilty of whatever you did. If you think that he can come back to you, better say it to him. I think that he could have many things to say back to you. Never loose good friends in whatever manner they come. They are sure to be kept.</h1>
