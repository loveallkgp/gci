<p>i have a frnd in college. Same year and same branch. For the past 3 years a certain kind of attraction/crush. We dont hang out much but hav a nice friendship. For him i am one of his best friend but i never talk much to him but always help him out. Few days back he told me that i m so introvert that dont talk to him too. And i said its intentional nd there is a reason to it. but the reason is i dont wht to talk with him. Whenever we are together my tongue make a knot of itself nd the way i then talk is utterly stupid. Coz i am not natural self then and its so frustrating. I want to hang out with him , movies; nightout lunches etc. But it ll be torture in the end coz he can never be the one. Now he is angry coz he thinks i dont trust and like him as a true friend. but It ll be hell for me to go near him . I dont know wht to do anymore.</p>
