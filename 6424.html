<p>I m Ayan frm Hyderabad,Sindh, Pakistan. And my problems are just related to my nationality. I met a Indian guy on facebook. And fell in love with him. He is caring, loving, charming and everything i wanted in my soulmate. He loves me too but we have a complication. Once he asked me Where do I live. I told him Hyderabad. Nw he thinks that I live Indian hyderabad city. Moreover, He has a strong aversion towards pakistani people and he is a hardcore pakistani hater. I knw Pakistan and India have never been in a good terms. But is dat necessary that our relation should suffer this.? I knw i am gona lose him as soon as i tell him. I have seen him abusing and using hate language over his social networking accounts. I dnt wanna lose him. What do i do? :( </p>
<h1>GCI- Its sad to see that we as gay people, who are discriminated the most and are fighting hard to find acceptance, can discriminate against other people based on religion, race, caste etc. If you think that your nationality is gonna bother him, better break things with him and move on. But you may not know for sure whether his feelings for you will count more than his feelings for your nationality. You have to tell him either way. Don't feel bad if he comes out to be quite toxic to you and judges you on your nationality. Some people just cannot look beyond hate.</h1>
