<p>i sometimes wish I were a robot. I wish I had no feelings and desire...I just don'twant to desire anything...not even a partner in my life and I don't want to feel anything, no love no affection. I just want to be a robot...a robot who is perfect in everythings...who works excellently for his daily wages...who just works and sleeps. I want to be that robot...I don't want to be dependent on anyone and neither I want to fall in love. I wonder I just can be a slave. A slave who has no feelings and works all the times and in the end he dies. I want to be that slave. I want to be a ugly stone. A stone who is never given attention...who doesn't beg for attention amd neither it is given. It just lies on road all day. I want to get so lonely that I get used to lonliness...so whoever tries to be friendly with me...I find him irritating and ignore him. That's what I want to be. I am trying my best and I wish I will attain all these qualities someday.</p>
