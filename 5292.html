<p>Hello. The issue of gay rights and marriage is close to all of us. But marriage started as sort of a trade-off between families. Now it is a matter of social status and prestige especially in our country. Yes, there is scope for love. The tiny fraction of love marriages have the secondary issue of societal components(earning equal, belonging to the same social class, etc.). Yes, India should and will legalise homosexuality. But the issue of gay marriage. How many would fight for marriage? Let us assume gay relationships become perfectly legal. How do you feel about marriage, heterosexual and same-sex? Keeping the spousal benefits(right to property claim, insurance and all that). Do you see any good in the institution of marriage? Do you really need the government's permission and a certificate to be with someone, to prove your relationship? Not just gay marriage, marriage in itself. Keeping aside, the family pressure and all that, even if you were straight, what PERSONAL good do you think it would do to you?
Please express your opinion freely.</p>
