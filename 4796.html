<p>ahhh,i can proudly tell that i am gay...
but ...i have lost my confidence..due to many rejections i get...from all whom i meet...
i mean..i have gay id and i date people there..but i am not a sex seeker...i am just finding my true lover...who is honest...loyal...true..trust worthy and romantic..but the problem is i feel like i dont deserve good looking guy just bcoz i am black and i dont look good....but sorry to say that love doesnt deepen due to look..it is deep if you have true heart and soul for someone..so i just want my confidence back...by ignoring that i dont look good..i feel so bad when people go away just starring at me for a second and they walk away..i just want some advice..that how should i overcome this awful feeling of rejections.....i love boys being a boy too..thats a different thing..and i am finding my true lover..but i am again not confident that will i get or not...just i fear due to my look...just pls help me to gain my confidence..thnks </p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you cannot change what you are so better feel comfortable in your skin. Do not wait for others to give validation to you or anything. First give validation to yourself. People don't love themselves but they expect others to love them. Just feel good about yourself and don't be desperate for someone. The one who is meant to be with you will automatically come to you.</h1>
