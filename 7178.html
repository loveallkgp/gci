<p>Hi admin.... want your suggestions.
I broke up with ma bf recently, i dont know why but even if i talk with my male friends he says your spending too much time with other guys, he always thought that m flirting with every guy i know and m nt giving him engough time but the truth is i spend most of my time with him.  Is leaving him a good decision for me??</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you should have had a talk with him before breaking up. You could have made him understand the importance of space in a relationship and the benefits of having a social circle. This can be applied in future, though I don't know what it holds for you. Also, if he is insecure, he has to work on it. It is also an attack on your dignity. There are things that can be said in a passive aggressive manner to make others understand.</h1>
