<h1>Viv- First of all, he is straight. Even if somehow magically he becomes your bf, in the long run it will never be successful. Becaue he is straight. They can never be comfortable with gay stuff. And you have to move on because ultimately a relation works both sides and not just one side. You can apply any measures to move on which you feel right and of course find a guy who can love you back.</h1>
