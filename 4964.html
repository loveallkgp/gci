<h1>GCI- Listen darling, you are being possessive for him which has to stop. At times in life you have to take some serious decisions, which are not good, but they are required anyways. Like a few days ago I took a decision to let go of someone from my past because I wasn't able to carry on. I had to let go for my own mental health. I have had enough of it. I am not saying that you have to let go as well. I'd say, find new people that interests you. Be friends with them without the feelings and all, and try to forget the past. It is difficult indeed but you will reach there one day.</h1>
