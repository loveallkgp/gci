<p>i think its my third confession here. They're not connected really.</p>
<p>My problem is that I come out as a bitch even when I don't really try to. The thing is that with all the bullying and taunts I had to toughen up, get snarkier, snappier. Not that I've turned into a bad person, I'm quite friendly, but my tongue has somehow lost a leash and my neutral face combined with bitchy remarks come out rudely even if I'm kidding around.</p>
<p>One of my friends warned me a lot of timesto control my tongue. But we were good friends, so he was used to me. But its a different story when others are concerned. I just simply let words out without thinking them over sometimes. I don't really hate the fact that I can sound rude - it comes in handy sometimes - but a leash is still important for a tongue like this. I just don't wanna throw a fit if my parents ever talk about the sexuality issue. I've controlled till now of course, and I don't hate them for their remarks on my sexuality but still, it brings out an angry side. That's when I need a shut mouth. Advice?</p>
<h1>GCI- You do that because you always want to have a upper hand in an argument. What you have to learn is that having an upper hand doesn't mean that you will always win it. Even if you are trying to explain something to someone by being snappy, it doesn't mean they will understand. They will go bitter with you and you will loose your point. What should be done is that you could stay clam and deal with it in a peaceful way.</h1>
<p>Also, you have to put a control on your tongue and that only you can do. I have an acquaintance here who is just as snappish as you have said about yourself and says stuff uselessly without even thinking once and whines that he has not got anyone yet and everyone runs away from him. I wonder why. So now that you got an example, try and think that you don't want that for yourself.</p>
