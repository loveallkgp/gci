<p>Hello everyone,
I want to confess here something...I hit my ex bf....yes I had to...because he left no other option for me....I did not initiate it though...he slapped me very tightly and left me shocked...i retaliated after some seconds and hit him in the stomach....though I couldn't hit hard but he hit me thrice....It all started on valentines last year when we separated altotally...And after that i had went through acute depression and was even on bed with low platelet count and slow functioning of the liver....my ex had come to see me then...and i was grateful for that and shall always be....I had even apologised for any kind of hard feelings..bad behaviour and hurting things which I may had said without my intentions while being on the bed with my hands folded before him...don't know he accepted it or not..but he had tears then.....But in the entire year he didn't spare a single chance to defame me on social networking sites to which i never responded....but then after a year on 13 th of feb he wrote essays of defamation on my pics in FB regarding me which were utter bullshit and trash..(I know he was not responsible but his friends were the main culprit behind it..so ignored it everytime)....but when he messaged me that how did i like the anniversary gift....I was enraged to the core...&amp; I decided to answer back because being silent is taken to be wrong most of the times...I went to the same place where we had met on the very first day....
and tore his last year's valentine and b'day card right infront of his eyes...(YES i had preserved it very nicely because of his true love for me)..he cried at that and then the whole scene of his friend calling for mutual apology started and lastly he hit me...as hard as he could....Rest I have stated in the beginning....No one supported him there..even his friends called it utter immaturity and wrong of him to do that....I created a scene without any obloquy and he was all numb....I was all hurt and saw nothing ..the public..our friends...nothing...I just saw him and me fighting at 10 in the night outside the station....
I still have pain behind my left ear and right hand as i write this...i asked about him from a mutual friend....U can judge me in whatever way u want ....but he is dead for me in every way possible now and would still pray for his well being because i believe in humanity...</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
