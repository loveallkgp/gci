<p>hai i am frm chennai...</p>
<p>this is my second confession..thanks to all to give thankful advices last time....
recently one thing happened around me..i had a fantacy over one guy frm my clg..we both are of same age...
he looks me also,as i look him..but not yet talked..
i wanted to get closer so i gave frnd req thro fb and he accepted in fews sec itself..he began to like all my recent status and photos..my life events and all...he is very rich guy..but i am not..
so
in mind these thoughts are going on..
what if he s bi or str8?
he is rich,does he thinks me as a fantacy?
is fb chatting is cool?
he has lots of gals frnds..but always roaming with another guy frm his class..</p>
<p>what he will str8/gay/bi??</p>
<h1>Viv- What is the issue here? Why is he liking everything on your timeline? There can be multiple reasons for it like attention seeking, he is expecting you to like his pics back and blabbity bleh.... OR! He is rich and is bi or straight? How could I know? I don't know Legilimency. Chatting is cool if you do it like normally. And I don't know what to say about the last thing... can't 2 straight guys roam together? <em>A massive sigh</em></h1>
