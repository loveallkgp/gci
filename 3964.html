<p>hello
My name is Riruru.
I am a straight woman.
Today I want to confess something. Few years ago my friend told me that she was lesbian and that was a shock to me. She had been my friend for so many years but this new revelation was quite shocking. I told her it's okay, it was in 2009, the same year when India decriminalised homosexuality. She told this to her family who were against her decision , they thought that sexual orientation was something which was a person's choice and it's change-able. I was the only friend who played the role of her mother and sister, comforting her that it's okay to be what you are.  she was in the science feild (IIT) and this was severely affecting her studies. So I took her to  counsellor and things started getting better again. she had told me that even though India has decriminalised homosexuality, she still feels caged and deprived of freedom. In her last year of IIT she told me thag she'd really like to go to some place, far away from her family where she could feel peace.  3 years after, I was still in delhi and we both were used to send letters to each other  In her last letter she expressed that she would soon leave the country as she had got a job in UK. I was happy because niw she would live in a gay friendly country. 
Its been 3 years, I didn't receive any letter from her. I had sent many letters to her UK's address but no reply.  As you must know, during summer vaccation, we teachers have lot of free time + paid 2-month-leave. 
So I decided to know her present status, In may I went to her mother's house but they said that they didn't contact their daughter, they no longer consider as her daughter and they were happy as she left them. The anger was clearly depicted by their expressions , It was obvious they miss their daughter but because she didn't conact them again ever after, they were angry. Then I joined Facebook but it didn't help. I tried many things, even talked with sine english people but nothing worked out.  she surely dissapeared and never preffered to contact again. Either she died or she probably lives with a lesbian partner and has changed her identity or she's dead.</p>
<p>:(</p>
<h1>GCI- Lets hope that she left her past life and started a new one with a new phase. God bless her wherever she is.</h1>
