Hi admin,here i go with my confession.
The feeling of wanting by someone special or the feeling of being loved is the most beautiful feeling in the world.when i see my straight friends dating a girl, it feels beautiful to know they are together.But i struggle even to find the right guy in our community. sometimes waiting for someone in life seems really tough.i know,we need to have faith and belief that someday someone gonna come in life,but sometimes this feelings seems futile,especially in india.sometimes i find and feel being gay is tough.everyday there is a struggle of inner feelings to be accepted and loved.i am not here to demotivate anyone,but yes i do feel lonely at times.sometimes i feel like,i wish i would have been straight,things would have been so different.at the age of 29,i would have been settled,if i would have been straight.but i am struggling to even find a right partner.sometimes i don't understand what is right and what is wrong about being gay.being gay is not always about sunshine and rainbow colours.and the irony,of life is i don't like sex date,which is easily available in our community.i hope someday,i would have the answers to all these.i am writing a confession after many days.
Thank you Admin, atleast i can write my feelings here.sometimes we just need someone to listen,and i feel this confession page does it. :-)</p>
<h1>GCI- I can see the mirror but I never wish for being straight. I am happy this way even if I am alone for now. But you can always have friends. I have some great friends and I know I can share anything with them. Like literally anything. Life can take a new turn and you will be having new things soon. You will not know it but it will happen. Just have faith in destiny.</h1>
