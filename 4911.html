<p>I am a 23 year old gay man, realised I was gay when I went to my teenage years and never hated myself for being gay but was always afraid what if my friends find out or my family did so that sometimes used to break my confidence and make me angry as well. Then thanks to the media, a lot of celebrities inspired me who were out and proud and made me feel better. Artists like Ricky Martin made me inspired and his book Me was another inspiration.
I guess every gay man should watch this musical tv series called Glee, which is about high school glee club and has a lot to do with society, gay students, bullying, coming out, gay romance and acceptance. I tell you as I started watching this show it boosted my confidence and Made me a changed man. Even some of my straight friends who watched this show, actually got got aware of gay issues and I guess even you should tell ur friends to watch this show. Today I am still in the closet but I have come out to few of my friends after watching this show and I am confident and my friends love me for who I am. I hope celebrities in India too come out and inspire the nation. Hope one day in India, loving won't be a crime.</p>

<h1>GCI- Damn! I love glee! I love the character of Santana Lopez. I love her bitchy nature. Glee is actually a good show that brings out the certain sections of students together under one roof where they have no problem with each other.</h1>
<p>We all as humans need to see things from a different perspective. We are so stuck up in our shells that we are really scared to come out of them. I hope everyone has the strength to live as they truly are.</p>
