<p>Hi guys, this is my second confession here. 
Its my first and last love. He was straight. We were friends from childhood, but became best friends while studying higher secondarys. After tht, i joined college we were still best frnds, we chat n spk in phone for more than 5-6 hrs a day. One fine day, we were just speaking and he suddenly said 'I love You'. As i had already a crush ovr him i told him wthout any hesitation. We kiss each other, smoochings and huggings. Thats all. But he is not interested in sex with me. This went on fr 2 years. Suddenly a strom came in my life. A friend of him, girl from his school life came into her. BTW we three were in same school and he havnt told me about her as his best friend till that. He said me this after her entry. After tht he slowly began to avoid me. For which i protested and fought. Ths hapnned fr many days he said he dont want my relation and asked to b friends. I rejected it and not spoken to him after that. They become so close friends. They are just friends nly. And i m getting away from him becos of her. Now i have lost from his mind and heart. He now wshing me fr my bday saying tht a formality or else i will say him its his mistake for not wishng. The next day he strtd abusing me sayng tht its bcoz me he done all those evrythng n he didnt do anythng of those stuff with full heart, just for myself he did it he said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, i was shattered!!!!!!!!!!!! Still thn i m all alone. I cant hv even best friends. I fear that they too will b like this leavng me alone.</p>
<h1>AdminViv- It happens yaar.. but dont loose heart. Scientifically emotional pain lasts only for 20 min. The rest of it only you inflict on yourself. So stop thinking and start socializing.... :)</h1>
