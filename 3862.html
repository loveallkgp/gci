<p>People misunderstands about us, I mean people who are gay. Most people thinks that gay people are very horny and have sex everytime. They wear freaky clothes. And does things other which are complete different than normal couples. Im saying this because my cousin asked me about how do gay couple behave?!. Her thoughts were those which I've mentioned earlier. Dear sis, at that point I would not answer because I couldn't frame my answer. So here my answer goes. We gay; I mean me and my boyfriend behave very normally just like other straight couples. We fight, annoy each other, cuddle and yes we kiss not publically but within our sanctity. We play PS4, sing stupid songs, text each other when we are not able to speak and talk all night long. Yes we like to groom ourselves, keep our clothes tucked in tidily, keep is clean unlike your boyfriend. And yes you ask whether we have sex who is top or bottom. Im top and he is bottom. Doesn't mean I rape or abuse him he is my life and I love him more than any other person. And finally there is one more distinction between me and my love and you and your scoundrel bf is that I don't cheat on him unlike your bf who every other day visits GB road to satisfy his worm. 
So here goes your answer sis. And I hope you could understand what's between us is very special that person like you could never appreciate or understand. All I know is that my mother, my own sister and father is very happy with me and they love my bf. I don't care what you and massi think of me. Im happy, my own family is happy, and also my bf very happy with each answer. 
And please do call if you see this. 
XOXO</p>
