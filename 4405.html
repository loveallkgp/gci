<p>hey guys... here i am the foxy of my piggy... allryt my piggy posted about our love story in his words and now its my turn...... firstly, when i read his post on this page, tears filled my eyes &amp; he comforted me as always... he was always present near me by my side...</p>
<p>Now, someone had a question y i call him piggy so lemme answer it hahaha... thats coz my little piggy loves to eat... my greedy piggy.....
Its our 8 month we celebrate on december 1st, for this past few months, not 1 or 2 but many times we hav shed tears bcoz of the distance and coz of the fear about wat will happen to us in future... gay marriage is not accepted in both of our countries &amp; our parents reaction worries us the most..... but whatever the matter is my piggy wont loose his foxy....</p>
<p>i truly love him a lot and im still waiting for a day where i will hear his foot steps in da airport &amp; see his figure coming towards me... that day will be the most special day in my life... even when i think of it a smile is born on my lips... i always say him come soon, not coz i cant wait but i want to feel his warmth, hug him, kiss him, do all stupid things with him as all other lovers do....</p>
<p>we met as strangers... complete strangers but now we have become one... one in heart...
my piggy i know u will read this, so i want u to know that i love u more than everything &amp; im ready to face any obstacles to be with u.. i promise u that i will make u mine legally &amp; give u all happiness while making all our dreams come true....
finally, guys our love story will never end..... we will marry... have a family &amp; live happily......</p>
<h1>GCI- I love it when they give nick names. Makes me remember mine when a strange gave me. I never had apple pie before, not gonna have it ever in my life.</h1>
<p>PS- Just enjoy and stay happy you two!</p>
