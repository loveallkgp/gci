<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    Hey it&#39;s me again
    Soooo
    I have too much baggage u know what I mean
    I might as well say some things I wanted to for so long
    Actually I need ur advice
    See I have an elder brother he is 4 years older than me and is an awsome person only .. we don&#39;t talk
    He&#39;s in 3rd year eng nd we haven&#39;t talked since I donno Dec and that too just hello hi
    He is more of a stranger than a brother to me
    And I guess I know why

    See when we were younger as in VERY young I must have been 7 8 years old since then we used to do things like making out nd once I think I sucked too
    Now you might think its molestation its not
    We were both too young to know what we were doing and I understand...... there is no sex education in our country nd kids tend to do stuff they shouldn&#39;t in order to understand sex
    But it continued
    He made a game out of it gave it a funny name
    So for me it was a game and u can imagine how as a kid games are games
    Exploited my innocence ? Took my advantage ? Ummm I.don&#39;t know
    He&#39;s my brother
    He&#39;s an awsome person nd he has taken care of problems .... HUGE TERRIBLE problems at home (mum paa not a very happy couple )
    He&#39;s a great person so do I want do defame him with such words ? ... No I think not

    So
    That &quot;game &quot; went on till ..well ...VERY long
    I mean as far back as I can remember frm my very early childhood till my early teens
    Then he went away to kota to prepare for entrance

    That&#39;s when it finally stopped
    And now I think he&#39;s too uncomfortable with me
    I mean I have NEVER EVER talked to him for more than I donno 2 hrs at length
    The longest conversation I ever had with was when I came out to him
    He&#39;s accepting I thank god for that he even played in a play that revolves around homosexuality

    See I have a VERY messed up family
    We are 4 strangers in a house
    My mum paa practically hate each other
    We don&#39;t talk about anything except studies food weather I mean we would talk about politics but not about personal stuff
    It&#39;s difficult sometimes
    I don&#39;t have many friends
    One or two with whom I talk occasionaly
    And this sexuality thing made me too self conscious ( also I was bullied relentlessly at school... Had too many girl-friends )

    So I feel terribly lonely and I don&#39;t see any friends in our community
    I&#39;ve just accepted myself nd am a new gay as they say

    I hated myself fr very long for being who I was
    For feeling the way I felt
    For being my brother&#39;s hoe ( never had anal though)
    Now Ive accepted it all
    I&#39;m hell lotta stronger and thank god everyday for making me feel the way I do
    Now I appreciate so many things that our straight fellows take for granted like love and marriage and fatherhood and sex
    But I also wish that I had just a pinch of normal life
    With a normal family
    Normal friends
    Nd gay me
    Nd sexy boyfriend

    I&#39;m young nd Im a dreamer
    I will set it all right
    The situation at home
    Situation with bhai nd all
    I&#39;m an awsome person too so I&#39;ve got hope

    Sorry I know its way too much but I had to let it out
    It&#39;s okay if u don&#39;t read it all
    It&#39;s a stupid sob story anyway
    I just wanted to ask
    Is.it okay to have a distant family ?
    I love them nd they love.me but v lack communication
    Is it okay to b distant that way ?
    I&#39;m working on opening up to maa paa but bhai is a bit difficult
    Help peezz
    I love you if u read it all
    Ur awsome
    Helping so many helpless souls
    Sir ur n angel of the highest ranks god bless ya
</pre></div>


<h1>Viv- I guess you should get together with your brother and forget the past. You both were equally involved in the game and it will be good to accept it and move on. The kind of messed up family you have, having brotherly love will come as a great relief to you. You just have to start TALKING and talk freely. Other thing will definitely fall into place if you have a little positivity in your life.</h1>
