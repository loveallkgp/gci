<p>hii guys...Is there any wrong if any good looking cute gay guy wanna become a escort just becoz his family is not enough rich to meet his luxury desires of lifes&amp; becoz the guy once loved som1 very truly but what he got return is big cheat on the face of him...u know y becoz its a gay life here pp
l uses ur emotions to fulfil their physical desires&amp; once they got it then they left with stupid excuses!!so its better make something out by selling ur emotions rather than allow them to use &amp; through in free!</p>
<h1>GCI- Its not wrong as it is your personal choice and you are free to do whatever you want. At the same time exercise caution along with good health as you may know that there are certain risks involved also. Now, the reason that you mentioned somewhat troubled me. You are kind of filling the whole you have in your life with rebound sex. Keeping the financial reason aside, hollow sex will only be so good until you have your beauty to support you. For the long run, make a stabilized choice.</h1>
