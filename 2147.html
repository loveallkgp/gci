<p>i've started going to gym and have lost many pounds, but the problem is, the gym trainer seems to be, you know, weird..... i've caught him staring at me many times, specially on that messaging machine where one's ass shakes so fast.. i don't know what to do... i'm not attracted to him at all, even though he is muscular, looks nice, but still, loving someone is totally other thing for me...and i don't think he's gay or something...(and yeah, there are many hot guys in that gym ;) ) </p>
<h1>GCI : yeah .. we know that already .. that there are hot guys in gym .</h1>
<p>he is your trainer and you are just anticipating thngs.. he is not staring he might be keeping an eye .. and darling he isn't asking for any favour  so just focus on your workouts ... for what you joined gym .</p>
