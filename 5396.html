<p>My younger brother told me he felt he was gay. I was scared and told appa about it and he slapped him lot. I think it was because he hanging out with a boy of that type. The boy looks gay with his fancy clothes and doesnt watch sports. I always see them together. Appa has warned him now to stay away from that boy. I also put app on his phone and mom sits with him during laptop so he doesnt do gay stuff. We also sent him to a psychatrist to cure him with hypnosis. He is showing lot of improvement. Can we do something more so he can forget the gay thing faster? </p>
<h1>GCI- Sorry to be rude but you and your parents are the bigots. You all should be sent to jail.</h1>
<p>1) There was no need of getting scared. He told you because he trusted you. If not family then who else. And you did the best thing. Running off to your dad and spewing shit like an asshole.
2) Slapping him was the biggest mistake. You guys are actually dragging him away from you. He is now scared of you and will never trust any of you with his secrets.
3) Being with a certain type of person doesn't change your sexuality. Listen carefully bitch, you have met hundreds of gay people in your life. You see them daily, you shake hands with them, you eat food made by their hands, you wear clothes designed by them. Think about it and then observe if you turn gay or not. 
4) And curing him by hypnosis? You all are bloody messed up people. You didn't even give him a chance to grow up on his own! This is what I hate. The family structure is all good but there is no individual growth of a person. All the life the person lives just to please others. </p>
<p>I seriously pray for your brother to have a strong confidence to survive you messed up people. And I will also pray to God to put some sense in your heads to accept him the way he is. THERE I NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM! You guys as mentally ill. If anyone needs to get cured, its you guys. Not him, but you.</p>
