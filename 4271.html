<p>Sometimes, I think that it is way more easier for heterosexuals to find a loving partner. But, for us gays, it is as difficult as to find a needle in the haystack placed somewhere on mars. Everyone looks at us as 'sluts'. I must not blame heterosexuals for possessing such a mentality due to their lack of knowledge. Rather, THE GAY COMMUNITY.
The people among us, the people we are. Even we have the same point of view as well.
Don't believe me?
Well, do you remember when you wanted to take someone out for a dinner just to know him better or when a guy wanted to meet you over a cup of coffee?
You don't remember..? Yeah! Neither do I.
Okay, one more question, when was it last when a guy texted you or you saw an update that goes like, "I have place in XYZ Nagar, I'm top/Bottom. Inbox me your number if you want to meet?"
Or you texted the same to someone else?
In my case, I see such update or texts almost everyday.
So where is the problem actually?
Ignorant heterosexuals (those who do not understand) or with us (those who do not understand themselves).
I don't say that all gay men are easily available for sex (hell NO). I've seen some guys who'd turn down a hookup offer as soon as it approaches them. But many of us are DEFINITELY easily available. And you guys know them better.
And who is going to change it..? The government (BIGGEST LOL), The society (duh)
God? Well, he is too busy listening to prayers.
Then who????
You know the answer better than me, don't you?</p>
<p>"In order to get your prince charming; you'll have to kiss a frog not sleep with the whole pond"</p>
<p>P.S. I'm not a saint either but it is well said by Mahatma Gandi, "The change you want to see in the world, must be in you."</p>
