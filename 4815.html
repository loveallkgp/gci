<p>When i was 18 (now 22) first year of my graduation, used to be hosteler those days and it was the end of November month, we celebrated our friends's birthday that night, it was a full fun night had every party stuffs, beer, whiskey, rum cold drinks everything was there and i was one of the sponsor, though i was sober those days so i was given the task of caretaker in case smbody needs, we've had a wonderful night, everybody drank except me, danced and finally it was the bed time becoz it was about 5 am or so.. almost every body was fully drunk, they couldn't even watch their steps, the birthday boy wanted to go for "poha" as he was drunk so i sent him with another friend, li'l drunk that time and i was watching all those drunkards for the time being including a guy of my class with whom i've been crushing on, he don't even remember what happened, i made him slept by my side so that i could watch him overnight and after some mins, i got hard after his touch, we both were sleeping on the same single bed side by side.. and to amp up the heat i tried reaching his pants.. touched his bulge form outside, he was hard too, i approached his insides, just touching and cuddling, wanted to take his rod in my mouth but couldn't in the fear of waking him up, there was around 4 more people in the same room but nobody was conscious and it was holidays so almost 80% hostelers went to their home.. though after some time, i stopped doing that.. but i must admit, this was the first time i ever touched a str8 guy's dick and it was very smooth and juicy, though he don't remember about any of it but i enjoyed it, btw he's a handsome hunk and a friend of mine</p>
<p>This was the nastiest thing ever done by me in my entire life..!!</p>
