<p>Well I used to love this girl n I had told her I'm bi... She still accepted me by saying she understood... At that moment I was crushing on my friend... God he was the definition of being an All Rounder... Seriously!!! But str8.... N I went into depression... That girl helped me a lot to cope... But when the thing was she loved me dearly and madly... I needed time to develope feelings but she was constantly forcing herself on me. So I said enough I can't take it anymore... Cuz we always kept fighting... But she is my best friend now... We hang out and she is the reason I found a boyfriend... But I feel bad for her.... Because she has lost all hope on love... And its all my fault.... You know she downloads all my pictures from my whatsapp profile and ogles at them... Poor girl... She is actually my father's best friend's daughter... I really feel sorry for her what do I do...</p>
<h1>GCI- Awww poor girl. She needs love and care. If you can find her a boyfriend then that would be super. Make her understand that it was good that you two didn't end up together because at a later stage the betrayal would have been even more disastrous. So she should accept the fact and move on and look for someone who could love her the way she wants.</h1>
