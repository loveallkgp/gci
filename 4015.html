<p>hey
its so difficult to find right person these days even outside India where people are open about their sexuality and ready to experiment. i have been living in Sydney for last 2 years and looking for any genuine gay matrimonial website or office anywhere in Australia. fortunately i found one newly opened gay matrimonial office in Sydney . after leaving my telephonic message to them they called me last week saying they can take my case as in they can find suitable partner for me but they have two conditions which i think will be the biggest hurdle at least for me. first was they charge $4000 ( big amount for full tym student and part tym worker) and secondly they wanted someone who is out of their closet which i am not and not thinking in near future. they also said Indian guys are very much in demand (raised my hopes and wishes) . i am desperately wanna go for this but coming out of closet without having any support financially, socially and emotionally could be devastating and moreover 4000 bucks would be fucking huge amt for me( which i think i can borrow from my frnds if i decided to go for it) ....ufff...dnt know what t do??...should i trust those matrimonial guys?? should i go for it?? or just keep hunting on useless planet romeo and grindr??..</p>
<h1>GCI- You can think about it this way. They businessmen will always say those things which you'd like to hear so that you can fall prey to them. After all they are there for money. You know where I am getting at. They are selling their views in a way that you feel restless and buy them. Use your brain over here. Finding a partner is not a race that you have to finish it before a certain time or before someone. It will happen automatically.</h1>
