<p>Hello</p>
<p>There all
Plz I m here to ask u for advice. I met this guy parv singh rathore. Online. And we started chatting and I fell for this guy. Most gentle person I have ever met. This time we chatted he never behaved like a sex hungered pervert. He would ask me how was my day and all stuff. I felt I was in love with him. I confessed my love for him he said I do like you but he will take some time to say that. As I m an eager person I forced him again and again he did said that but not whole heartedly . Then In anger just to get back to him I changed my fb status to in relationship with someone else. With in few hours I realized my mistake and ask Him for forgiveness but he blocked me. I know I was mistaken and I should have never done that . Plz yar if u r reading this just talk to me once . And plz guys if u friends with parv singh rathore plz tell I miss him so Much I will be very thankful to all of you guys
Sean Thaper
Plz help me guys wat should I do </p>
<h1>Viv- You know the kind of thing you did was just an attention seeking action but sadly it was backfired. This eagerness was the very reason for it. Only thing you can do is wait for his return...OR! Make a new profile to get him back! Toodles!</h1>
