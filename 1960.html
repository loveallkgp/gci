<p>I don't know how to start, what to say but, it all started when i was in 10 Grade, probably i was 16 at that time i stated to fell in love with my bestfriend and that i know he is straight. I stated to met him through my cousin bro, as they were already close friend before i knew him. One night i was on my way to the store, walking alone i met him half way and he walk with me cause he know that i'm a geek(Yes, quite a geek) drop me till i reach home and then ask my number. I started to have a crush on him, we text everytime. He even hug me everynight before i walk home after tution. He call me early in the morning, evertime. How i could rerist to love a person like that and plus already my crush. I stared to love him, love him so much beyond extend. But all that went in vain as he was straight, i hurt me alot, broken inside. Now, because of him my heart stop to love anyone, when i tried to love other person i coun't, i don't really know what happened to me :( i still love him even now.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well you have to make yourself understand that you and him are not possible so you have to define a line to which you can approach him. It is a slow process which you have to learn. Then only you can be free of your emotional trauma.</h1>
