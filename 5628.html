<p>P.S.- to my readers, this is a bit lengthy.. So if u choose to read it then kindly be patient and kind enough to go thoroughly through it. And to ADMIN, keep going bud this is an fantastic initiative to voice our thoughts and ideologies.. Kindly advice me..
So here I begin,
I live in gwalior, u don't find gay people easily anywhere.. But by God's grace I found a guy looking for a healthy relationship.. We came in contact.. Met twice (as in alone).. coincidentally his place wasn't quite far from my own.. the time we started talking and knew each other for merely two days.. this guy.. Proposed me.. he was quite sure dat he loved me and I tried to trust him and agreed to his proposal a week later.. He was always insisting me on things like.. "send me ur nude pics" or "we're gonna have sex" ( P.S.-I was ready for the oral thing but he was always telling me for anal which I wasn't comfortable with, at least not this early.. that, however he failed to get through his thick skull)
I tried to explain to him my mental outlook but he always said that what's the issue wen we love each other..
He is like always so judgemental about approximately everything that I tell him.. ( I Hate such judgemental people but in this case I LOVE THIS GUY TOO)
I don't know what to do.. I've tried to talk and clear such issues but he is such a dumbass to understand any of this.. and I don't want him to leave me either coz I've developed certain feelings for him.. I don't know what to do.. He his unbelievably un-understanding.. should I brk up with him.. Coz I've been trying to resolve things.. If I explain him too much he is like getting angry and telling me that I always upset him..
What the fuck.. What have I got stuck in.. Help me please..</p>
<p>P.S.- sorry for any mistakes or any offensive comment made.. </p>
<h1>GCI- Relationships are about making you feel good. If you are not or have questions with whole setup, clearly something is wrong. I was in that condition but for my own mental health, I had to break things up. And I am glad that I made that decision.</h1>
