<p>I go by the fake id of Ran uswerd which is an altercation of ran anus weird . I am the closeted angry guy with irritating confessions and today what happened was totally unexpected. I was arguing with this guy who comments with #sarcasm who was initially very obtuse to me and we argue-chatted for nearly an hour I called him mean words and totally hurt him but later when we were talking about monsters under bed and we were talking about the least expected thing. to say that it was arousing would be an understatement ,we both went from arguing to literally sex chatting which I felt was wrong .I do cam sex chat with strangers mostly and this time it felt wrong because he was more than a piece of meat.
I thought I should share this because it all started from your page GCI Some matchmakers you guys are</p>
<h1>GCI- So it is a start of something new, I take it?</h1>
