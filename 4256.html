<p>I am a student pursuing my bachelors. Yes, I am a homosexual. I discovered it when I was in 8th standard, though I remember that I used to stare guys and especially their legs from a very early age. None of my friends know about my actual sexual orientation. I don't have a fake account. I haven't even liked this page but I visit it regularly. What about this world of fake accounts and constant craziness to go physical? Is that all? I am not against anyone. I was brutally used by a brother as a student of class 8. The blood that did bleed then was accompanied by tears. I still remember my cries when the organ was forcefully pushed inside me. I still remember that after he was done I was ordered to massage his legs and lick his sole. Yes I did. I began enjoying the fear and domination I was subjected to. Years passed. I don't have a clue what life awaits but I seriously need some good friends in life. I am alone. yes, I am. Why do people have to be
this lonely? What's the point
of it all? Millions of people
in this world, all of them
yearning, looking to others
to satisfy them, yet isolating
themselves. Why? Was the
earth put here just to
nourish human loneliness?</p>
<h1>GCI- Simple answer to that could be that people don't want to come out of their shells. Everyone of us is fighting a battle from the inside but we don't want to show it as it may make us appear weak. People don't like human connection. If someone speaks their mind, the person is targeted as a fool, a dramatic attention seeker etc. We have get out of this barrier and start being humans rather than in our protective shells. We are humans before every other label that we make for ourselves.</h1>
