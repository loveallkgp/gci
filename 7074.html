<p>reference to #7065
same girl again, ur comments were really valuable for me to take decision and understand the whole situation, here is what i have thought :-
(1)- i love to be with him, and i want him to care for me same as he is doing now for the rest of my life, i cant deny the fact that i somewhere may feel the need of sexual satisfaction also but at the end of the day what u want is affection, understanding and caring that he is giving me anyway, and people don't die having sex, after a certain age wt all u need is a companion.,</p>
<p>(2)- i wud be more jealous if he goes out with gal, yeah thats a mentality. Even after knowing that he is homo, i m more insecure and jealous when he talks with gals, and even if i m marrying a straight men he will definitely fool around wid gals..., </p>
<p>(3)- me being 23 gives me a chance to be in relationship with him for some years and know all the situations and real life problems that i might need to ponder about.,</p>
<p>facts to help u guys to suggest me further - he calls me every morning and talks abt the day, i have seen him giving many things to get something in my favour, its his nature and frdship for me.., shares everything with me.., these r littile things but matters alot, 
what girls want - time- he gives me alot, love, understanding, dont look other girls, - he is doing all..., and i wud give anythings to see his smile !!!! its soo cute, i wish i cud show u ....,</p>
<p>i m asking u guys to give me final suggestions and after this i will come here again only to share how i proposed him......, </p>
<h1>GCI- O! time now for a real good lecture.</h1>
<p>1- U r strt, he is gay. Ur love justified but your one sided decision nullified.
2- U r in love we can understand but he may not be in love with you or lest he may never 'love' you the way u do, then where would u ask for justification?
3- Its fine that you want him to be in your life and u r ok with everything about him, but in doing so u r marring his existence of being 'gay'.
4- It is a win win situation if he marries u for any reason but trust me u will lose him forever if u really get him. Only time will clarify what I meant in these lines.
5- U r being blind to the fact that had not been the problem with lgbt to make their presence felt, the need of sec 377 to go or to have pride walks, every endeavour would had been meaningless.
6- U r acting out of love is understandable but practically speaking a gay man cannot remain satiated with a woman in any way coz they are not made for any. On a mythological note, Narad smriti forbids gay men to marry women.
7- What if u r proposed by a girl and the same amount of love is showered on u by ur own sex and gender?!
8- U may marry him and live a contended life thereafter but that will be YOUR LIFE only and not his.
9- The present scenario for lgbt is not encouraging on many levels but y r u making it harder for yourself and him?? Does he not any have say in telling whom to live with or not?!
10- A similar case was posted by us where a gay man of 60 shared his trauma about his 'successful marriage'. I shall re quote his words for you to be candid-
''I WAS THE BEST FRIEND SHE COULD GET BUT NOT A PARTNER. 
I WAS HAPPY OR ATLEAST I THOUGHT I WAS, BUT LOOKING BACK AFTER SO MANY YEARS I CAN SAY I M HOLLOW AND NOT HAPPY.
I NEVER FELT THAT BOND OF BEING A HUSBAND ENTIRELY AND IT FELT EXHAUSTING''.</p>
<p>Its nice of u to be such a good person but over goodness can ruin someone's life when we least want it.</p>
<p>P.S- Now the decision is yours! Whether u want to act selfish by marrying him or r u really of that psyche to understand that your love is 'useless' even if u both take this further.
We are the admins and are elder than u dear and have seen, met and read cases of gays marrying women and then suffering from cognitive dissonance thereafter.</p>
<p>Goodluck and have a happy life!</p>
