<p>So today i was having a conversation with my sibling and she abruptly said ,atleast i'm not like you,gay. I'm normal ! No, i'm not open to her but i guess she somewhat knows about my sexuality . She would sometimes make homophobic comments about feminine gay guys if they come on television,she hates them to the core ! Though i'm not feminine ,She's doesn't wants to face the situation of confrontation of my sexuality nor do i want to talk directly but i do leave some hints for her , She's extremely homophobic ! I am in my twelth grade right now . I don't feel the need to come out to her as i know she'll be reacting with a supposed mockery. But when she says stupid things like we're not normal and all that i feel bad about my life . Though she loves me a lot but i'm losing my faith on her .
PS admin:- Don't even think about talking shit about her, as i love her. it's just a confession about my life !</p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmm...so u have a bitchy sister...oops sorry homophobic sis and u want her to be understanding...like how???</h1>
<p>O yeshhhh!! I get it, by asking and trying to prove virtually u r a loving brother ....Sorry but I don't buy this crap of bro-love sis without having a reality check...
And u can do nothing until she is really moved by ur plight someday and tries to know more about our community and ''U''....till then love her and protect her as u want and thank ur stars that she hasn't done anything stupid yet.
She has conditions to love the people in her life it seems and when reality will hit u....u will hate urself for being overtly loving brother. Goodluck!</p>
<p>P.S- Its 'twelfth' grade and not twelth...</p>
