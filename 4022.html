<p>Some people are going to severly criticise me but probably I'm little patriotic.
I know admin went out of country for academic purpose but I feel sad when others say they want to live india and reside in a gay friendly country because I don't want the LGBT population of our country to run away. I want them to fight with us for gay rights in country, they need to realise that if you want to solve a problem, don't run away but fight. I want you to fight, atleast for yourself and Future LGBT generations. If we will run away then who'll fight for them. They too may have to suffer like us. I also want LGBT community to work hard and contribute to economy, millitary and betterment of mankind of our country.</p>
<h1>GCI- Many gay people are already serving but they are under cover. Not every gay person has the finances or anything to support their out-of-india education or anything. Few do. And everyone here can fight. Many gay people are out and proud but they feel contended when their families accept them. Nothing else matters to them even if the country in which they are living considers them as a second class citizen. People really have to come out of their shells and feel passionate about their rights. Its all about passion towards the right cause that you feel.</h1>
