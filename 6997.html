<p>Hi, I work for a company which is LGBT friendly. Recently we are also asked to wear purple in support of LGBT. 
Coming to my story,  I am fresher here and I daily observe this very handsome guy from delhi, good physique, huge biceps and all. I always wanted to befriend him and talk to him but didnt dare to. So one fine day I was waiting at the elevator and he passed by 2 or 3 times. I acted like I didnt saw him. He came back again and started talking to me. I couldnt believe it was happening. 
Slowly friendship is growing. But I am confused he is gay or straight or Bi. His relationship status on FB is complicated. I wish he is gay and propose me! I want to keep him forever.</p>
<h1>GCI - Keep him if u can but don't make him ur 'keep'!</h1>
