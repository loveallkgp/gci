<p>Im a horrible guy. Im so ashamed of what I've done to my love. He was kind and was always warm even if i messed up. He was diamond in a coal mine. Things were all going good untill i started abusing him, slapped him hard so many times but he never left my side. He always stood even after i messed up. I love him but sometimes work pressure gets so hard that im not able to concentrate on anything. It just fucking happens. He always tied my tie before leaving to office next day after i messed up i always hoped that today will be much better than yesterday. But sadly nothing happened. I always promised to take him out for dinner but i always missed him. Finally he finally had it enough and left me a note saying that "i always wanted you to stay with me, your money and fame are useless to me! But you where no where to be found" for a second i thought he joked but than i realised he left me and house looks so lonely without him. I still miss, its been 7 months and im not over him. The other side of bed is so cold and coffee in morning is so tasteless. I miss you and i promise i will change, i know you will see this please reply i miss you my heart aches for what I've done. Without you im body without blood :'( please comeback. I love you. I will always kiss you just the way you wanted before sleep, and will make you sleep in my arm everyday holding you tight :( please comeback. 
and to all fellow men please give time to your love, don't ever hurt them. I was stupid and late to realise his value. Don't make stupid mistakes like me. 
admin say something maybe he will listen! Also im sorry for your result i messed it up and hampered your studies :( please comeback 
'ever thine, ever mine, ever ours'</p>

<h1>GCI : you slapped him ....man !!! wtf</h1>
<p>that's physical violence &gt;.&lt;
if i was at his place i would have punched you back .. humm </p>
<p>anyhow nothing can't be done . this relation was a lesson for you . in future never ever lift your hand on a person you love. he won't come back to have 'abusive relationship'.
just chill . things like this happen .</p>
