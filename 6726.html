<p>Hi..!! I'm 30. I'm a PhD, Biotechnologist, working in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine in a private concern. I am a bisexual, and no problem for me with girls either.. However, I am having a chronic life-threatening health condition for past over 20 years since my childhood.. I often require hospitalizations for some complications/ side effects arising due to medications.. I tried to convince my mom not to look for a girl for me, because marriage would be more like ruining an innocent girl's life knowingly.. But she is very adamant and today gone to a popular matrimonial office.. Although I like girls, I still feel that I would possibly ruining an innocent girl's life because of my health problems.. Just think practically, how would any girl marry a guy having congenital health conditions, and living with a chronic disease?? But my mother is arguing that "there must be someone to look after you after our death".... "You must give us 2 grandchildren".... "You love your Grandmother and she wants to see your marriage before she dies"... And much more emotional weapons... Even my dad took my mom's side, and I was left out... There was a big drama last night in my home.. I just told them one thing - try, but don't ruin an innocent girls life... I'm now in a complete dilemma/ confusion.. I don't want to ruin a girls life, but yes, I agree one point on their argument that it would be difficult for me to be alone in long-term.. Even if I marry a guy, if I die early on, I would be hurting him a lot... Several risk factors are there if I get married.. Who would take care of my family, if I die early?? I don't want to harm anyone's life.. I m ready to sacrifice my life, but not harm others life.. Also, Which father will agree to marry off his daughter to a sick person?? Because, after marriage, lots of responsibilities, duties and tension.. I'm unable to manage even small tensions in my lab now... Just thinking short term is not enough.. Marriage is a life-long commitment.. I doubt whether I would even live for 25 years more?? I know everyone have to die someday, and I don't fear death.. But yes, if I die with unfulfilled responsibilities, I'm doing injustice, I m doing wrong... Given the fact that my life is like an edge of sword, living at a tip of life and death everyday for 20 years, its a gross injustice to get married.. I don't want to harm anyone's life.. I m ready to sacrifice my life, but not harm others life.. Even if I marry a guy, if I die early on, I would be hurting him a lot... However, I do wish that I have a partner who understand me, live with me, but with no social strings like marriage attached... I'm trying to explore alternative available options like contract marriage for social stake or Live-in relationships, wherein I would allow my partner to live the life he/she wishes to.. Friends let me know your opinion for this.. Isn't my decision right??</p>
<h1>GCI- I feel empathy for you man because its been months I saw some altruism. Ok now let me don on the counselling mata avatar-</h1>
<p>1- U r fucking 30 not a kid, so stop acting like a 20 year old teenager.
2- U need to tell your mother u r not a child producing machine and have to tell her about the nuances of your marriage which includes your chronic ailment.
3- U mustn't take a decision where u fall short of futuristic goals.
4- Indian families are one of the worst in world in emotional blackmailing &amp; whitewashes our minds to obey the neo-structural/ structural functionalism(status quo) theory of the society, so better ignore this basic fact and move on without stressing on it further because it shall only change if U TRY.
5- MoC or Live-ins have multiple considerations to deal with and its not mandatory that the person may act according to ur wishes.
6- Ur decision is partly ryt and partly wrong.
Right because it wants to save someone's emotions &amp;
Wrong because what if u had an ailment after someone had come into ur life and you would had not thought of other viable option then?!
7- Someone wants kids then is surrogacy dead or are your mother and father looking for a person who will come with 100% guarantee of giving them kids, u dying after him/her, or are they trying to say that they are ideal parents and really care a lot for you?! I m sorry to be harsh here but they are acting totally cliche and turning a blind eye on your problem which needs equal attention.
8- One question here! What is the ailment..is it contagious or is it malignant?? If yes or is of the kind then remember that you being in someones life or not shall not make any big difference- But if u anyhow fall in LOVE then do one thing- Just let fate takeover and listen to your heart.
9- My guy if had an ailment and I had to live with it I would have chosen to LIVE with him and not wait for him to die because he would be alive in me always- ALWAYS.</p>
