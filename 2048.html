<p>excuse me admin i am the confessor of confession no  2039
but u seem surprisingly harsh in your comment. First of all i DONT think he is superior to me. Seeing one's crush would make anyone feel week in knee Does not mean he would be considered "superior"
and Yes I know its not love but it is sure as hell not lust.So many times we have seen a guy and we just want to be around him, hold his hand , talk to him. We picture him as anything other than the guy we want to have sex with because he is that special crush. For three years I have seen that guy talk walk and i admire him just the way he is. SO it is sure as hell not lust
and Did i ever say destiny wants us to fall in love? In the confession itself i have said maybe he is straight.
You seem to be too biased in saying we Wont ever meet and i would never confess.. Have you seen the future? there are endless possibilities and sometimes the unlikeliest thing do happen. I am someone who has come out to my sister and my best friend and hence confessing him would hardly be an issue if we meet in future.
Please read the comments on my confession in which people are criticizing you (and rightly so) for being unnecessarily harsh and rude.
This is a CONFESSION PAGE for GOD's sake, People come here to reveal their secrets, weirdness their insecurities.. stop chiding them and giving them suggestion as if they dont already know them. I would ask you to be unbiased and post this as a confession.
I came here to confess but your unwanted harsh words has left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
