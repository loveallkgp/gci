<p>Hey admin
How are you</p>
<p>M always regular reader of this page
Tdy i want share my small story n want some help frm u n othr ppl..
In August i become a frnd with guy here frm othr city(not my own city, but i go thr to his city for some my professional
classes) we start talk but initially he ignored me But on second day he give his number we start chat thr. Again not response so much even me to, as days are going on we chat n chat
In a singal day we send hii to each othr more thn 5-6 times but not talk too much.. as days were going... now came September we chat chat n chat so i said to him for meeting coz daily i go to his town.. ist he make some excuses n ol but thn we finally decided to meet
So we meet in last week of September really its was the best meeting ever for me we go to mc'd n talk too much...
He told me his past story... which was a wonderful love story but now thy are not in relationship n we become good frnds...
Now we chat more on watsup or some time on calls as so become good frnds so we decided to meet again at same place with in 10 days means ist week of October ( i remember ol dates but can't mentioned here) again nice time with him again we spent 4-5 hours together
So the bounding become more good now i start call him daily. We chat on watsup everytime n on call for hours whn ever both are free...
N meet third time again with in 12 days again of second meet n become bestiees
As one day he put a satuts for need bf n his demands n i got so jealous n i realized tht i fall in love with him
But m not upto the point of his demands n m not deserved him..
N he knows tht i feel for him but he says now m not feeling the same n agr ho jata hai tbi acha agr ni hota tb be acha. He says this thing to me on third meet.
We talk ol day nights on calls...
He care me very much pamper me
N me too care him actually mein uska dimag jada khta hu.
Now m confused is he feel for me or not
Or i should proposed him coz he just know i feel for him but i not says it directly. He is a different guy not share too much but he share with me. He is soo good mature guy so handsome but m not.
Now wht should i do.. coz day by day my feelings for become more n more stronger
So my basic questions are
1 How i know tht he like me or love me Or not ?
2 Should i proposed him in very romantic way as i think.. ?
3 Or i should give some time to him. ?
But i dnt want to loose him in any cost.
Plz help me
The thing i tell u tht m kind of overcaring person.
Thanks for reading.
Hope for best to best suggestions
Thanku so much.</p>
<h1>GCI- Let it grow more. If he is in love with you he will himself say it. Try giving him hints in between like looking in his eyes etc. But just let things happen on their own. Don't make any weird move that could creep him out.</h1>
