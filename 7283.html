<p>I m feeling so down n shattered that he never loved me . after so of almost 1 year he left me n i came to knw that he was just to fulfill his lust . y people do like this ? there are plenty who seeks sex they must go to them fr fulfilling their physical need , y to choose innocent souls.   </p>
<h1>GCI- I will tell u why!</h1>
<p>Bcoz some people are super-cowards....they cannot bear that they could be called sex seekers...bcoz of the stigma attached to it...</p>
<p>Trust me these are a new breed..THE NICE GUY FUCKSTER....they will be nice, will be like gentlemen, will be very friendly and open and very convenient but when it will come to come for the introsepection that what are they doing with their lives..they will simply blame and tell one cliche thing- THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN A RELATIONSHIP AND ITS NOT ALWAYS THE BAD GUYS WHO CAN HAVE ''FUN''...and 'gay relationships' as quoted by them as a hoax because in reality they do not have any living conscience, they want to get away by being happy at the stake of others' life if need be.</p>
