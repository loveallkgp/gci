<p>Like all other belligerent pages , this page is also downsizing the gay community's pride . Kinda stuff available here , is directly poaching over the fact of questionable relations that may exist between two males . I feel pity for all those people who blindly liked this page . </p>
<h1>Viv- Long story short, this guys means that this page isn't serving his purpose. Now if you were so concerned about the community efforts you would have done anything in reality. A conversation with you on my account made it pretty much clear that you were not at all interested in discussing gay issues(I can produce the proof). And you had the audacity of being blatantly hypocritical to say that we are downsizing the gay community pride. You really have no idea what it takes to read so much issues and to guide people on the daily basis. Sometimes I cannot even sleep. And people like you bloody come here and criticize. First do something and then compare. Otherwise be ignorant like you always were.</h1>
