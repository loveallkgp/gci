<p>Hey bros!
I am a straight guy. I accidentally came across this page and then thought to ask you people something.
My best friend who is 19 says he is gay. He has said this to nobody but me over a year ago. But he doesn't behave like gays. I mean nothing gay at all so how can he be gay? I guess he is lying to me. He is the straightest man I have seen. He looks good, yes more than me :P and girls go head over heels for him but now I have noticed that he always treated girls nicely but never dated anyone. Handsome guys like him start having relationships way early but he still hasn't got any girl. Even most beautiful gals hit on him but I thought he was choosy. Now I have started doubting about it. Weeks ago he said he is really attracted to a guy in my neighbourhood. I said he was joking but he said he was too serious. Is he really gay. He said since we r frens of 11 years he has cone to trust me with this part of his.
I dunno if he is lying or what. I mean he was not gay and why would he want to be gay? its not like he has lack of girls. He is even Muslim and as far as I know Muslims hate gay. Why does he say he is gay?
See I have nothing against gays. I respect everyone's freedom of choice. But I don't want my best friend to be gay. How can I stop him from being gay and agian be normal? He says he cant change. I asked how long he has been gay and he said Forever. I know he want gay forever. I love my buddy like my own brother and I know he does see me as a brother too and so asked me to keep it a secret. Please tell me how can I change him back? I want my bro back :( As planned I want us to grown old together and see our grandchildren play together. Please guys tell me something. Peace out guys. Hope u get ur rights soon.;)</p>
<h1>GCI- Thanks for the wish. There is no way you can change him back just as you cannot change to being gay. He is what he is. You just need time to accept him. I guess you can be his strength. And as far as religion is concerned, your identity is the biggest truth on earth and even being religious cannot change it. So better accept it the way it is. There is no option b.</h1>
