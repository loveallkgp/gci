<p>I had come out to a couple of persons outside my family, and thankfully the reactions were not bad. Now I am looking forward to come out to one of my friends. We were in the same college learning the same subjects. But our interactions are quite loose because our homes are far away from each other. He is quite a good person. He has been good with me the moments we had spent with each other. We even used to walk holding hands or by arms (FYI he's straight). But the problem is that he is extremely religious. And according to his belief, being gay is a big no-no. And I don't think so he would like to befriend with a gay person. I am tired to act fake in front of him and want to tell him the truth. But I am quite hesitated to face him worrying about the consequences. I think he won't accept me as a gay even after explaining him a lot. Neither I can change myself, nor I can become what he wishes. I think so we should break the friendship and part our ways. Should I come out to him? Or should I still keep hiding my identity in front of him? Help needed.</p>
<p>$ABBY : see infuture if he gets to know you are gay he will feel like you kept him in dark . so either finish ur friendship or just tell the truth to him ... ( which is wrong .. religious people are even dangerous and who knows if he will pass this secret in how many people in college ) which will be threat for you . or either keep t.hings like this.. what is your sexual prefrences is non of his business</p>
