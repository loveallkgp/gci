<p>Sometimes I wish I were a girl. I know homosexual love has feelings as strongly aroused as in heterosexual love, but my life so far has been spent in a highly heteronormative (heterosexual-favored or  aiming more at the heterosexual viewers) society and haven't been exposed to much LGBTIQ stuff. I never bothered to find out much because I am kinda content with all the western heteronormative social media which small references to homosexuality. My hands were already full with being an ambitious student and other emotional issues I have and I have never had much time to really deal with the homosexual society, of which I am currently indirectly a part of. Yes, I do have a fake Facebook account but it is really dull and hardly some interesting people appear. Most homosexuals seem to be busy filling the hole in their butt-cracks to have time to be filling the holes in their head. The bigger holes. Then there seem to be gay men who seem be more emotionally aware. Both these types seem to not have any sense of rationalization and look down upon "prostitutes" and other things they can look down upon in synch with the society.
Scattered.
That's what the situation of the LGBTIQ society seems to be in India. 3/4ths of them don't seem to want anything out of life except sex. Maybe because that's something they can get more easily than love. The emotional people who can partially rationalize but spend rest of their brains in being indignant about it. Then there are people like me who are totally indifferent to love life mostly, get horny sometimes but aren't really that bent on sex because we find our careers more interesting or perhaps are just running away from the pain the former two types of people seem to have embraced. And there are also guys who openly abuse homosexuality while indulging in homosexual sex, rigidly conformists.
I think the western concept of individualism seems to have fared much, much  better than socialism-individualism limbo in this country where people are just torn between what to choose in life...
These thoughts sparked in my mind with this song (do listen to it, if you can)</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPC2Fp7IT7o</p>
<p>The emotions seem to be just so strong. And heterosexual. But so beautiful, so powerful. And when my screen goes blank after the song is done playing to reflect my image, I just see a scattered self. A part of love which seems to be almost unattainable, if not completely so.
Why can't wanting a fairy tale love story be not as easily achievable for me? Why does it throw me into despair? 
I dunno what to think. I wish these thoughts would stop revolving in my head and the ripples on the calm surface of my mind gains the glossy stillness again as I look at my textbook for psychology beckoning me to delve again into the depths of human mind which is so close to me yet so beyond my understand no matter how much I try understand it. But of course, I won't give up, no matter how many times I fall, I won't give into the fantasies that a lot of people believe about the supernatural. Rationality and science has always been my savior, and hopefully always be.</p>
