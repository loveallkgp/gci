<p>hi, I'm 23 years old boy. I'm from jorhat, assam.
I came to Delhi last year for my higher studies. this last week, i was going back to delhi after spending holidays.
train me mere seat ke samne ek bahut hi cute sa ladka tha.
I was getting attracted to him.
he was quite young. shayad 16 or 17 years old.
he ticket was not confirmed.
in night, when everyone was sleeping, this guy n his father were anyhow sitting. I felt pity and offered him to share my berth. mine was middle berth. and he was thin.
so we got adjusted.
it was very cold. we shared the same blanket.
I couldn't sleep properly.
I just wanted to hug him.. deep kiss him...body play. . I couldn't stop myself. now I feel guilty!
I moved my hand to his chest. he didn't objected.
I then slowly moved my hand to his pants and slipped in his underwear.
I was rubbing his cock by my hand and also rubbing my cock on his back side.
his was full erected.
I wanted him to give some response back to me. I was thinking to go to toilet with him and do body play.</p>
<p>but he was acting as if he is really sleeping. like a statue!
I stopped then.
in morning around 5, I again did the same. but he again didn't respond at all. I started feeling awkward!
later his station came. he got down at kanpur. but he didn't talk to me anything before getting down. not even looked at me once. :(</p>
<p>I think he was purely straight.
I should have not done wat I did.
shayad wo mere se bahut gussa ho gaya hoga.
main kabhi kisi ke sath train me aisa nahi kiya tha pahle.
ab soch kar bura lagta hai ki why I did that.
:( it feels bad.</p>
<h1>Viv- Aise hi kisi ke saath bhi lag jaoge kya? Agar uska bapu police mein hota na to beta aisi jagah pe dande padhne the ki teri booty double size ki ho jati. :p</h1>
