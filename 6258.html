<p>Again shit happened with me. So i was talking to this guy since 9-10 months, via wtsapp/calls/texts.And we were in different cities so we did nt meet.Finally we met, We have shared many pics n so many cheesy conversation dt can be converted into a romantic novel very easily. That guy was very gud n showed lyk he cares for me a lot,He came to meet me only to delhi from jaipur. We met and damn i did nt like her at all,He was looking very skinny and weak as if he has not eaten anything in his whole life :D.Then i kissed him fucked him but dont know why i did this? I was very horny and could not control myself , He did nt say anything n jst follow what i said. My mistake, I admit! He gave me a diary while going n that contains everything about us in his handwriting, He work hard for that i know but now i m feeling guilty because i m no more interested in him, i cant be in love with him, he keep on text n i keep on being rude finally he gave up i guess. But he called me at my birthday n i talk to him very rudely and called him gandu and oll. i did nt mean this but i just cant love him so i thought may be his self respe t will wake up n he will stop trying on me.I deserve better.. :) but ya never falll in love without seeing him in person :D take my lesson boys.</p>
