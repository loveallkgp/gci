<p>What am I?
Two years ago, I stayed at one of my frens room for a few days.
One night, we were watching some porn together. We came across one video where there were 2 guys and a girl. It also contain male on male action. We just watched and said nothing. We watch a few more video, straight and bi both.
We stopped watching and started normal talk. We begin to talk dirty. Both of us were excited.
Slowly he turn the topic on sexual experiences (he demonstrated one by physicality coming very close to me, lips near lips) and then towards size of our private parts. He suddenly grabed my penis (already hard from all those video and talking) yo check size. It felt good, he said he shud check properly by putting his hands inside my pants. He did. And also took my hands inside his pants.
I also went along. He said let's try kissing. With hesitation, we did. Somehow we ended up giving blowjobs to each other.
Next morning, we pretend as if nothing happened. And the incident was never brought up again.</p>
<p>But yesterday, we talked about that incident, both of us ashamed.
He admitted, he might be bisexual because of that incident. I also said the same.</p>
<p>So, does only one incident make me gay or bisexual?
I like girls. (But also have developed a liking to watch bisexual or gay porn without ever wanting to have sex with a man. I just like watching men doing things on men or girls)</p>
<h1>GCI- He might be bisexual? It's like he orchestrated the whole incident to get in your pants.</h1>
<p>Anyway, sexuality can be fluid in some cases. It's not much of a matter.</p>
