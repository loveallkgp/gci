<p>I guess I say it for a lot of people when I say this, the general class of the facebookers here is not very sophisticated and revolves around coitus, I'd call them facehookers 
This leaves the more sane sophisticated normal crowd wonder if they have any future with whatever they're doing here.
After a breakup from an 8 month relationship as I come back to where I started from, I am not able to find any normal sane guy here, just people hawking an eye on big dicks and huge butties and no one is genuinely concerned
I completely agree sex is a major part of a relationship, but a relationship that is based on the walls of sex is rather prostitution in my knowledge.
What I urge to do with this confession is that if we can form a little society or community of people who are sexually sane people with some basic etiquettes so that no one goes empty handed eh? 
By sexually sane I mean those people who have better words in their vocabulary than "frm? Plc? Asl?", people who start a chat with "Hey" instead of "t/b/v"
I have discussed this matter with my like minded buddies and they too feel that there is no hope left for people like us here
And if you feel the same do give me an add, I'm Robert Allison
And umm yeah that's it, ciao babies.</p>
<p>$ABBY : i don't know why you people call ' sex seekers' inferior and yourself as ' inferiors ' . and ' prostitute ' , ' sluts' , whore' isn't it name calling ..... aren't you acting like those pathetic heteros who cal gays ' fags' , 'sex seekers' ... don't be a nutshell. </p>
<p>about your problem ' which isn't even a problem '..... there are a lot guys like you in lgbt community ..look for them . instead of dropping into chats make them clear what you want and if they don't want the same unfriend them . that's it . instead of telling somebody what to do learn what you want to do ... don't become a teacher .</p>
<p>shoutout to all you people : </p>
<p>don't be judgemental towards anybody who demands sex, not everyone's have same body demands . some need more sex and some can die without having it once . its all hormonal.</p>
