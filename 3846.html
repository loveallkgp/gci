<p>Hello admin
I am Arijit Biswas. I am 19 year old guy. Earlier I was an engg student . I was forced by my parents to join engg while I was intrested in creative field, I was 17 then. 
I left engg in midway and became a drug addict and was raped also. This is the period I became more bold and came out openly as a gay to my parents, friends and family though my parents accepted me the way I am. I was sent to a rehab for treatment. 
Now I am fine and still under pshycatric treatment because of my depression.
I have planned to study jewellery designing.
I have changed a lot , from a shy introvert guy to a expressive and emotionally strong person but I am very lonely.
I am planning to settle with a guy as soon as possible but alas I can't find anyone. I know some people will say I am too young or will reject me because of my dark past or will say that they don't like girlish bottom but I don't care.
Is there any guy who wants to marry me and settle with me? I also want to adopt a child.</p>
