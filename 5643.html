<p>Something fuck really happened today. These days i am becoming incredibly confident about myself and wanted to come out to two of my friends on my birthday as they said, they were really loving me, caring me etc. So after their nagging I decided to come out and Told. Previously thought people will somehow identify me as a gay even I didn't say, But actually what happened is they kept on telling me that I am not gay but just that I think I am gay, because of some  feelings towards guys. They said so because they would easily identify me if I were gay ( They might have meant effeminate ). Thank god I haven't been seen as effeminate gay. I think I am quite macho. This is my 2nd coming out after I am free of my guilty conscience. </p>
<p>But I wanted to be 100 % transparent to them ( most stupidest decision ) I have ever taken. I thought to show them my fake profile as a reason why I am not going to my original profile often. </p>
<p>In my fake profile,  I happened to speak about my original friends ( Those to whom I confessed ) to my fake profile close friend.  I actually shared about one of their original profiles to that close friend in fake profile. and wrote about the other friend ( a girl ) that how accepted me as i am ( without her name or identity ). Then they saw that in those messages and got incredibly tensed for sharing their names and profiles ( just the guy ) with fake ID people. They call the people in my fake id as unknown random people. I shared only with one guy whom I know very closely like a next door guy. </p>
<p>So a happy ending accompanied by a bad and stupid ending. Lost good friends I think. They blocked me in original profile. they are friends of real world. But things changed upside down in 2 days. What I did is wrong ? I cannot relate it people. Can you please help me by explaining in relation with you ? Should I stop coming out ? Should I come out even if I have to do a lot of back works like this ? I think I shouldn't show my fake profile here after to straight people.  But I always feel I am hiding something from them and I thought I should make my fake profile known to them. Am I stupid ? please help me what should I do. I feel like they unfriended me for stupid reasons. first time a girl misunderstood me. :/</p>
<h1>GCI- WHAT DOES THANK GOD I M NOT EFFEMINATE MEANS??? dude thats discrimination and hypocrisy both!!</h1>
<p>Anyways u acted somewhat hastily and now u r just sulking over ur foolishness...See its ok to come out to people but only to those with whom u are comfortable at every level..coming out for the sake of COMING OUT is not a very good thing to do! All the pre requisites and repercussions must be foreseen and ur peace of mind and safety must not be compromised at all. got that???</p>
<p>P.S- LIVING IN THE CLOSET KILLS UR SOUL AND COMING OUT HASTILY CHOKE UR MIND!</p>
<p>CHOOSE WISELY LIVE WELL!( damn this line is so perfect here)</p>
