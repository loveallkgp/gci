<p>Friends and abby and Viv , I posted several posts earlier. I am 31 and settled in USA. From last 2 years I am doing the same idle stupid job . I am not concentrating on my job as my personal life is bad. Lonliness and series of break ups made me sick. I am kind of jelous of my friends who got married and I don't hangout often with them as they r busy with their family.</p>
<p>Before I was very ambitious in career and I was successful . I want to get my zeal back.</p>
<p>Anyone of u are in this situation ?</p>
<p>Any tips to overcome this and study new stuff and find a new job. Please guys</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, try to be happy. Whatever you have to do for survival, you have to do it. There are no second options about that. Secondly, if you need a change of mindset, you can start looking for those guys who are actually good and start dating them. But if you want to stay away from relationships that is totally fine also. Go on some vacation and get your mind refreshed. Take a brake from the usual life and entertain YOURSELF. Get happy and be back with a bang.</h1>
