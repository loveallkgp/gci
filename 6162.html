<p>Hello everyone!
This is my second confession here. I have been following this page for a long time, and I guess this is my one of the most fav companions.</p>
<p>So, here's the story. He gave a visit to my pr. I found myself visiting his page quite sometimes, really frequently. I knew not what was destined, but I sent a text.
He replied.
I found myself waiting for his replies, but they would come after a long pause. He never spoke like I did, but when he did it convinced me that he's trustworthy.
Once in the middle of out talks we discovered I'm one year senior to him in studies on the same department. He asked for a help. I took my time and replied with blunt expression that he may see me. But I was excited; excited at each time I texted or he replied. That amazement kept flowing through my blood.
So, then he came. I took him to my room where I stay with 5 other straight, and obnoxiously, homophobic guys.
He came at night, 8 o'clock. First we exchanged some conversation, then we straight went deep into studies. Whenever I'd see his face, or see him lying, I'd get distracted. And in between out bookish jibber jabber, we'd quietly slip into something else. I'd take ourselves back in books.
The time came when he must start for his place. I felt 'no'. I asked him to stay, firmly. He did.
All the lights were turned off, the dim street lights will fall on us to lit our do's in the city lights. I don't know how, our lips met. The tangible skin got arisen in mysterious amazement. His warmth flowed thru my veins.
That night our eyelids didn't close the opening.
The next day, necessarily, he went. I watched him go. Then I started feeling his absence strongly. I forgot to eat, I forgot my books. I didn't know when the next track started playing from my playlist.
That's absurd to me. All are so dececive in one life. The hung I wanted to run away from, came hugged me of its own. This guy awakened the dead me inside. And we're not meant to be together by default. I can't tell him, nor can carry these all.
<em>The End</em></p>
