<p>I am mature guy in my early 30s .Never had relationship with any guy. I had two gfs at two different times (never got physical with any of them). I never had intercourse with any guy or girl, yet. I satisy my lust with watching porn online or jerking off by watching guyz online( skype/yahoo). Few months back, I met this guy online thru PR and don't know what was so special in him that i fell for him on day1. The feeling was kind of mutual. We exchanged number on first day and this was the first time i had given my real facebook id to someone. I live abroad and this guy was 25, a delhhitte.He was in to mature guyz( had a married bf, to whom his relationship was just ended). He made me realise that I am someone really special to him and i instantly fell in love with him. We used to talk on whatsapp, skype for hours . Slowly , he got busy and kind of started ignoring me. We always had a tiff on only one thing that he doesn't give me enough time. I was expexcting that when he wake up, he should send his first text to me. He was kind of bindaas and carefree attitude guy. Nevrr understood my emotions. We fought a couple of times and only for one reason that he ddoesnt give me enough attention. I thought of moving away couple of times, but couldn't cause he was my first bf ( and that too virtual). One day he proposed that since this relationship has no meaning , since we are distant so we should slowly keep apart from each other. I couldnt take that and was kind of under depression and frutsation. I kept missing him day and nights. Couldn't sleep at night and always kept
Checking my mobile at night , whether he had sent me Any mesaage on whatsapp or not? Finally , i came to india for a small visit and we met for like 3 hours. I couldnt feel that he was in love with me or anything. We talked casually. I didnt talk about any humiliation and ignorancd and then i finally decided that i shouldnt impose myself to him anymore. Its been almost 4 months now .i didnt send him any message , nor i received any mesaage from
Him. I still
Miss him. But i wonder, what kind of world is this? You make someone realise that he is someone special and exclusively yours and then you ignore someone and dont talk to him anymore, as if nothing ever happened? Is sex everything? Wonder if the world has produced such real hard /hearted people like him or am i the only one with such heart, that couldnt forget and forgive him till now? I belive in karma and lets see what happens next .</p>
