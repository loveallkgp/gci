<p>"Hello everyone 
I had sent 3-4 confessions or rather tragic stories but they were never posted here.
I try this once more with a more recent story of mine.
I have been here for long and made many friends .
Through a fake account i used to chat and make friends . I had chats with a guy for 2 yrs . In the 3rd year of my college as well as chat he asked me to meet me and gave me his real fb id so that i could know him. I saw everything. He is from my hometown . When i went home in holidays in deepwali ,i had an accident i.e. i was trying to save a man whose clothes had caught fire due to fire crackers and the palm of my left hand took some burns . When i told him this story he was desperate to meet but i ignored and went back to college . I came back in december for my winter holidays we chatted again and eventually met in dec. He was a cute guy slim fair and shorter in height than me . He looked attractive and had sweet voice as he was in his 16s. We planned to meet another day in the morning and on the third day he proposed me i could not say anything . We chatted and met and eventually started kissing and  smooching (heavenly feeling). We met and kissed everyday . Time went by and he started class 12th and i was in my last year of college . He never studied and always talked to me everypart of his life (except sexual) . I decided that if i stay he will never study and ruin his life . I started going away and soon found out that he was in a hospital . I could not say a word except cursing myself and he was on the verge of death . But i decided to stay away and its been 3-4 months when i talked to him again and he is fine and busy in his studies but then we can never be best friends again as he is not ready to forgive me . But we are certainly friends . We both are leading healthy live. 
Plz give ur opinions and ur reasons akong with it. 
Was it correct on my part to stay away?</p>

<h1>gci- Not in any universe was it good. Why do you have to put someone through this when you can't keep it together? Is it the so call consciousness for the greater good? Lemme tell you that it sucks. On the contrary, you should have told him to study more and managed time for him. That was a cowardly act.</h1>
