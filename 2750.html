<p>'A page from my diary'</p>
<p>18 July, 2014
The day of my anniversary with my lover. Came from Himachal to Delhi for a week and we had good time together. It was our last meeting for the session as he had to go back next day.
so we planned to meet and celebrate together.</p>
<p>He had to buy books so we visited a book market first, the weather was beautiful that day.
sprinkle of rain and both walking along and touching each other on hands, shoulder and some times holding hands.
This was lovely. After book market, we board a metro and reached the central park, Cannaught place.
Green all around, breeze kissing my cheeks and sprinkle of water, this was the most romantic weather I have ever seen.
He don't talk much so we just sat in front of the tallest Tri colour flag. I was in full mood to kiss him but that was a public place so I couldn't.
We kept looking into each other's eyes without caring about all around. We both shared our thought and said whats there in our hearts.
Here comes the most filmy and dramatic Scene.
We both had to go now, so we checked in Rajiv Chowk metro Station.
I have to board yellow line underground, my lover Came with me to drop me.
On the platform, we were holing our both hands, facing each other, and looking into eyes.
Both smiling and loving through eyes. Train came from my back and doors opened, I shook hands, Hugged him and had a kiss on the platform. I was moving back steps to the train, still smiling and looking into his eyes. I made my lips and said "i love you" and he replied back. i was continuously looking to him. Doors closed and a drop of tear rolled over my cheek. Perhaps I will see him directly after a year, but I was happy and I love him more than my life. We both are happy together,
I share my stories to inspire people and to make them understand that life is very short, love and enjoy the love, because chance may never come again. </p>
