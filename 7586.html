<p>Male 21
So it began when I was in first year. I was in relationship with a girl from school. Things were going fine but then we broke up because I was unable to give her sufficient time. We had a mutual friend. She knew him when she was like 7 or 8. He was my classmate and eventually we became best friends. After I broke up woth that girl, after one year I started developing feelings for this guy. I don't know what's happening with me. I am going crazy for this guy. We are best friends, we sit together, eat together and when I am with him I feel like I cannot have anything better than this. Whenever I see him I just want to grab him and kiss him. I am so confused about my sexuality right now. I don't know what to do. Should I tell him about how I feel about him or should I stay in the closet. 
Am I gay or bisexual? 
These feelings are only for <em>him</em> , I never felt anything like this before for a guy.</p>
