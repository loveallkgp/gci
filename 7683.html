<p>Hello friends ..... wish u all a very happy new year ....friends I really wanna know ... why is it so important to let xyz know what ur sexual preference is ... people talk about coming out of closet , people talk about freedom , democracy &amp;  equality . But I seriously don't understand by letting someone know what ur sexual orientation is how do u think u will get what u want .... sexual orientation is a very personal identity of Urs should it not be left personal..... friends acceptance come from ur heart .... the time when u start accepting ur self the way u are trust me u will never be in need of any xyz to accept u ..... what is even wrong in being different I don't understand and what is even there to not accept ur self as the way u are  .. just stand infront of the mirror and talk to ur own self . And try to understand what's wrong in ur life.  Figure it out and solve it ...  and trust me being different is so much in fashion</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh boy, where to start.... I know that coming out and being different is a personal affair, but telling that to people is also important, at least to some extent. When you live in a society where you are judged to be a certain way, expected to do certain things in life, and are trained to behave according to a certain trait, being different is not considered to be something good and fashionable. So from here the need to tell openly begins.</h1>
<p>This very need is also personal to everyone. If you don't want to do it and keep it personal, do your thing. If someone is saying it out loud, let them say it out loud and aware more people.</p>
