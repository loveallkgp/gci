<p>Hello....
Its me again,</p>
<p>You destory me in a beautiful way, I still love but can't be with you coz my self respect is greater then your love now,how you both can think that we three can be in a relationship, thanks for breaking up with me. I always use to think that do I deserve you,but now you don't deserve me. Im so tired of same old and its faltu ka drama. I'm sorry to say but your thinking,thoughts, bole toh your mentality is more uglier than you. </p>
<p>Frnds.... If you are not happy in a relationship don't fake it, just leave it. I can't say that I will love someone in future. Instead of searching we can focus on our career and can do something big for our community. Homophobic wants chance to point us,bring us down. Please don't do anything stupid that can bring us down.</p>
<p>Admin you are so cool and great wish can know you more 
'we all are creating of god
not of some hippys saints or priest and society'
God bless us all.</p>
<h1>GCIL- U just need to see the fact that there are no good or bad people in life, our perception, cause and chain effect and being extreme on a societal scale creates these attributes and u keep urself busy in striving balance of ur life...its not ur job to comment on the people u left behind.</h1>
