<p>I don't know how to express but really fed up with this closet and tired of acting normal while heart says its not normal. Going out makes feel like hell for there are guys wonderful everywhere :P .feeling guilty for making eyecandy with males. I didn't realize how exciting it could be to see some girl for a straight until i myself have got this habit of peeping out for males. sometimes its like i forget what iam doing and watch out with wide-open eyes to look at someone (ofcourse i like seeing their handsome /cute/ sweet/ sexy/ smart/ FACES... not any thing else. :P) but its not normal for others and people end up watching me with their weird faces. LOL.</p>
<p>and now it's a more painful thought having to understand that it may not be possible to be in a wonderful relation with any guy who loves me and whom i love as its our country!!. and its not so easy for an average looking guy to get into a relationship even after a hook up as no one wants an average guy into him(loving him), even though they get into each others pants. :( they only want to get temporary relieving pleasures.</p>
<p>why is this so?? why don't people understand ones who really seek a real Loyal relationship... ... Ofcourse it's not needed for them to comeout... as everyone knows its not a normal thing here.</p>
<p>Fed up with complaining but still doing it... and here in fb its too much painful to look at cute couple on several pages (of other countries ofcourse) and not having a hope for ourselves. its a hell. and even knowing many wonderful guys but not being able to get into love with them is a really frustrating thing. and watching straights who are only in their teens ,still have their fb walls quoted as "In a relationship" makes life more hard. :( . having to act as if nothing happened while one is caught watching out men walking on the streets and men travelling thru buses!!</p>
<p>.
.
.
it will take another whole big broad large huge great book of sorrows if i start expressing all my feelings :P</p>
<p>IS THERE ANY IDEA WE CAN GET OUT OF THESE SITUATIONS. IS THERE ANY WAY WHERE WE CAN GET A LOVED ONE?? </p>
<p>What's it thats making me emotionless towards people even of my interest? cant say its love because i am broken due to my feelings for a straight friend. Really lost all my feelngs for everyone who ever it is. it seems like i've become a dead-heart fellow. it was much different before. a strong urge for feelings. a strong urge for getting people to love.
HELP me get out of this situation guys!!</p>
<p>-M23 from Hyderabad who is feeling sad for his past 4 years. </p>
<h1>AdminViv- Is being emotionally fragile do any good? No. Will it serve you any purpose? No. Will you get anyone in future if you brag about your sad nature with any guy that you could meet with? No. The situation is sad because that is the reality, buddy. People look for hookups more. The society judges you. But the case of India is far better than western countries where queer people are just killed for being so. People here will judge you and bully you. But you must not get sad by all this. If you try to move forward, there will be people to pull you back. You will really get someone who truly deserves you, honey. Don't forget that you're a wonderful person. :) Keep smiling always.</h1>
