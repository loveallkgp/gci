<p>Im gay and im 23 and been coping with it for so long... Ive had depressed teens.. Some of my college friends turned against me cos they found my behaviour 'different' n im not even feminine.. N never came out to anyone.. Maine sabse dosti khatam kar di.. But the things is i fucking hate myself.. I wish I die.. Also u guys are smart enough to handle everything even this gay shiz.. But im just too fucking dumb.. Like good for nothing super dumb guy.. How do i kill myself? </p>
<h1>GCI- Never ever think for killing yourself! Just never. Think about the damage you'd do if you carry out that step. You led yourself into that kind of situation because you never talked about it with anyone, I guess. The burden which is upon you is increasing and that's why you are having thoughts like this. You just need to socialize more with like minded people who can be your good friends. You have to pour your heart out. If you can't find a friend, just start writing a journal. You don't have to depend upon others for your happiness. It can be found within yourself also. Accept yourself and you will never be alone. There are many more who are going through the feelings just like you and you are not alone in this.</h1>
