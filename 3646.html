<p>DEVON AUR SAJJANO(though many wld like to b called deviyon if they had a magic wand)..anyways....i have been READING THE SUSH IN THE BUSH..more than actually seeing him on the T.V(sushant divgikar).. well I wld like to say some few things NEUTRALLY about effiminate gays...1-THEY r the one to face hostiity from the very beginning even before they come to know about their sexuality and gender identity...2-THEY are the 1 who face ostracism at all places and from within their community...3-THEY are the ones to be raped mostly because of patriarchial upbringing of INDIAN men...4-THEY are the worst sufferers in terms of relationship and stuff...many of them see their lovers marrying ryt infront of their eyes...5- THEY are the first to be the VISIBLE ones of our community... 6-THEY are the ones who bring diversity to our community....7-THEY are the ones with whom every WRONG happens at the first place........NOW THE FACTS AND QUESTIONS.....1-IF u think being MANLY would help then please go and SHOUT that all gays are not effiminate..might it may help!!!! 2-IF u think that turning MANLY or ACTING normal would help then do it ...make urself comfortable..but u can just advice on how to behave..not on how to grow up!!! 3-IF u think that NORMAL acting gays are more accepted then dont forget that the same majority also says that they want us to TURN STRT or turn BI..and even think its a part of MAN'S growing up..IS THAT POSSIBLE??? 4-feminine guys are more visible but do u know that even if they act NORMAL (as many of u say) then also their feminine acts just get more MATURED like women ...it gets polished and curtailed...it DOESNT GO..just as OUR GAYNESS doesnt vanish if we try to cut the CRAP OUT..5-MOCKING our own community as hijra and chhakka doesnt make SENSE at all...it is like denigrating our very own existence....these terms are PATRIARCHAL in its root..it is by default DEROGATORY bcoz it is a trick to mock our very own existence..THINK??? 6-MOST of us know how to comment but many of us dont know how to react regarding GENDER IDENTITY AND SPECTRUM OF SEXUALITY 7-LAST but not the least try to accept both sides of FEMINITY AND MASCULANITY both from the INSIDE AND ON THE OUTSIDE...amongst ourselves then talk about gay liberation..activism and gay marriage stuff...GOOD LUCK!!!!</p>
