In response to the confession #1132 from the same confessor !</p>
<p>Well guys i read all your comments n thanks to those who were in support with me. N #Admin i guess u still didnt get what i have said, i would request u to read it again. Okay fine if forget d rest 2 conditions of his status n that of his communication in english BUT what about the monetary terms ? As i have already said that now its bugging me off to take care for his expenses ... its been a month n i dont remember when he had last called me ! He never does that, he tell me that he miss me n den he dont put any efforts to talk n waits for me to give him a damn call ... wen being asked he has explanations like balance ni tha, msg pack khatm ho gya tha, abhi paise ni the n etc etc ....
He wish me to take him for movie n m the only one to bear the tickets, he wish me to take him to CCD n am the only one to pay off the bills ! If he wish to come to my place i have to go n pic him up from his n then also drop him back n forget the roaming, hangout things. Am almost 13 kms away frm his place n daily m the only one to travel so long .... petrol ni lagta kya meko ?? usse bolo to kehta ki mere paas gaadi nai hai n bus route mujhe pta ni n all those lame excuses !
what should i do now ! i dont even wish to lose neither i want to hurt him ...... :|</p>
<h1>Viv- Well as I said the last time, you two should talk about it and you should make him understand as well. Like he puts his financial condition infront of you then why can't you?</h1>
