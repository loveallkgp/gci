<p>I feel that I can never make friends. I also tried making friends on Facebook but to whoever I send request, when I greet them, they don't even reply. I get more saddened that some people openly declare on their facebook profile that they won't befriend with any peraon who is not good looking and not willing to share his photograph. I wonder is there anyone who really wants to make friends here. Who's here? Are there only sex seekers and stupid guys who write their preferences for friends in 'about him'?
I am not being a moral police but sometimes I feel so sad, earlier people were choosy only in love but now also in friendship. Even though I am not ugly but if you all guys will only look for handsome partner then what about those who are don't look good? don't they have right to love? the way you look doesn't depends on a person but on his genes, it's just like sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Stop watching gay movies of handsome actors. Ordinary gay guys are not always as handsome as actors.</p>
<p>and after reading this, if you have heart then pleae accept friend requests of people and don't ignore who greet you and try to be friendly with you.</p>
