<p>Hellooo #AdminGCI and all the friends here
I need suggestions and some advice from everyone... but plzzz be a little gental while commenting...
I am little worried about my sex life.. Actually what happened is.. I had sex with my boyfriend yesterday night... We planned to have anal for the first time... Earlier we just enjoyed oral sex with each other And it has been great doing that...
But yesterday oral sex... foreplay every thing went pretty awesome.. when my boyfriend got ready to take my dick I was very excited.. but while trying to penetrate his ass I lost my erection... I don't know what happened that time.. I just lost my erection..I felt tierd
It never happened before when I had oral sex with him... I always had very hard and good erection at that time.. I was really embarresed when I couldn't do it... my boyfriend said its ok. We can do it again some other time.. And we ended up having just oral.. My boyfriend is behaving normally after this.. but I couldn't get it out of my mind..
I was embarresed that time and I am still embarresed... I am scared now that if next time also I couldn't do...
Admin and friends plzzzz suggest some good measures.. I am feeling very low now... </p>
<h1>GCI- Is it your first time ever? And are you mentally prepared for it? I think something is holding you back and you are not ready to have sex just now. You should figure it out and talk with him about it. It also happens when you feel difficulty in penetrating or if you have cummed once before, you cannot sustain an erection for a longer time. It's normal. You just have to do right things to have a better sex. As I don't know much about you and the sex life of you two, I can't make a specific comment.</h1>
