<p>Someone please tell me what's going on. He is my friend....He knows I have a thing for him. He is straight and I am gay for him. He knows this....even though we never talked about it. He doesn't have a problem with my sexual orientation...he sees me only as a friend....and has made this clear on various occasions. Why the hell then does he come to my room, takes off his shirt and decides to sleep right next to me? He knows the effect he has on me...why did he torture me like this? All I wanted was to be in his arms....just a hug...or a touch maybe....i am never going to get over him.....but why did he do that? he never goes shirtless infront of anyone....even though he has pretty good body....why did he do that? </p>
<h1>GCI- Uff... koi kuch kare to issue, na kare to issue.. Anyways, buddy just say it on his face "You don't like it and if you want to be just friends you got to stop showing me your body", if he is bothering you that much. Make it crystal clear for once and for all.</h1>
