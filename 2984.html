<p>Hi 23 m Delhi</p>
<p>This confession is with respect to #2901.. Yeah he is right.. when I was new in delhi last year I faced the same issue..I have some gay friends and sometimes I felt like as if whatever they speak goes over my head and is out of the world.. with time I realised as they told me about it and i myself observed it.. It is indeed called "Farsi" (yeah but not that so called Persian- both are different).. and its very common atleast in Delhi amongst LGBT community.. mostly all gays are aware of it especially the "CP crowd".. The gay park in CP Delhi is a gay cruising place and it is always full of bi gays transgenders and kinnars as well.."And MIND YOU, they all do hv their secret codes and a way different language".. I still don't knw much just a few words.. cz my friends dnt want me to get involved into all this stuff.. For eg: koti (a transgender), giriya (top), beela, janane,natthi etc.. I am just posting it because u guys scared the holy hell out of that confessor.. and I kinda related with him..he might be curious like I was. .Its not anyone's fault too cz no one is a pro.. lack of information we can say.. Well its my first confession ever u knw :D :p and the ones who wanna hear it I would recommend them to come visit gay park in delhi smtym ;)</p>
<p>And admin seriously it seems there is more than one person who is running this page.. because I can never expect such a rude behavior frm you.. you hv disappointed me.. I hv regularly read confessions over here and I do appreciate
your advices and ideas,your work and your spirit..As now I am back here after a long time,makes me wonder wat is wrong with you lately ?.. I am embarrassed.. :( </p>
<h1>GCI- There are two guys running this page. And as for the being a bit angry, everyone of us has a certain limit. See, we are working to make minds a bit liberal. So if any constricted mind comes, there is  heat. Don't bother much. Its all temporary.</h1>
