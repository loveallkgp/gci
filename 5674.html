<p>Hey friends m confused... Ye id mere friend ki h.... Actually he lost his bf nd was damn sad used to cry everytym thts y i suggested him for this account to just enjoy..... Now one guy met him up nd he  was very bad looking as  my friend is dashing at extremes..... The boy proposed my friend on first meet..... Aftr some tym they were togthr... .the boy deactivated his account... .nd my friend on tht guy's prmisn gave this account to me...... But now i saw tht guy is online means still using the account !! meets nd enjoy nd side by using to pretend relation with my friend...... My friend is very loyal nd loves him badly tht guy even dnt calls him now...... But my friend doesn't says anything as he dnt want any dispute btwn them.... Shuld i tell my friend tht tht person is befooling him.... Or should i let him carry on like this.... As if he now got seperated he will die internally.. ... and may suffer serious prblm..... </p>
<h1>GCI-  Damn that freak !!! ok is ur friend under acute depression??if yes then don't promote him to be in a relation....and be his rock! and if ur friend is really that good he deserves a guy who can take him to the path of light and not throw him into the thorns of darkness again....and for that guy who is in his life....just make sure u expose him without making ur friend vulnerable..</h1>
<p>P.S- Depression is overcome clinically my medicines and psychologically by support and fresh thoughts that are uplifting..GODBLESS U BOTH!</p>
