<p>One of the most devastating myths to transgender people is that we are one way and becoming another way. You hear terms like, "aman becoming a woman", "used to be a woman", "I knew her when she was a guy." Etc.As if a trans woman was ever a man, a trans man was ever a woman or someone who is not binarily identified was ever strictly either.The truth is that trans women are women and always have been. Trans men are men and always have been. And non binary people are and always have been their gender identity. Trans people do not transition in order to become the gender they identify as. We transition to better match the gender we are. And even then not all transition, and transitioning or not does not make someone any less their identified gender.So, no, men can not become women nor women become men nor can anyone simply change their gender. This much transphobes have right. The fact of the matter is trans people were their gender from the beginning. No one became anything, some of us just chose to start presenting as the gender we always were.This is probably the single most important truth about trans people that the public needs to understand to help end transphobia.</p>
<h1>GCI : see in society things are not talked . india where people don't know what gay means .. expecting they will know the meaning of a trans person , their story , their life or their struggle isn't even a question .that's why documentary movies , articles , stories and books are written to raise awareness . we will aware people here on this page too but everything will not happen soon .</h1>
<p>i get you point . its good knowledge that you shared with us .</p>
