<p>I am a 26 year old gay married to a bisexual who prefers women. Actually I chose the girl myself and even she wanted to get married for name sake under social pressure. We have never had sex and she has a girl friend however of late I have developed sexual feelings for her and want to have a normal married life with kids. Pls suggest me ways to win her heart. I would be grateful to u GCI.</p>
<h1>GCI- Have you talked about it with her? And are you sure that if you do anything to woo her, she will be okay with it? And by extension, will her gf be okay with it? However, you could woo her by taking her to some exotic locations and get her stuff. That's what girls like.</h1>
