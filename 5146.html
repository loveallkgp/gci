<p>few long months back.. a journey started.. u came into my life... we were just talking for time pass... u were the one of the few who never cared how I looked... or how I sounded.. suddenly that time pass ended.. and bloomed a relation of frndshp so sweet.. that had carried us forward thus far... but then came the usual rift.. some differences some misunderstandings... we ignored each other.. but we apologized..... Once again and went ahead. stronger than ever... this time the it was bigger..our frndshp had a grtr bond this time... everything was going smooth...
but then again came a month of darkness.. but u did it again tried to come out of it... I was really really happy...
but what can we do if nature is against ur frndshp... again we have to call it quit today...
im very sorry u have to suffer all this yaar... u didn't deserve this...
but I pray that u live ur life.. happily . all ur sorrows and problem may just vanish into the thin air.. and u move ahead stronger than ever.. I know most probably today this journey has ended.. but.. I wont be able to get over it...
ever.. unfortunately I nothing but the memories of ours.. to remember u..</p>
<p>nothing more to say.. nothing less to regret</p>
<p>and I wish anywho reading this may not suffer such a separation from his/her frnd...</p>
<p>relationship breaks due to hate, non adjustment, deception, cheating and differences... but frndship breaking is not coz of such reasons.. its purely bad luck and it hurts the most...</p>
<p>BUT IN A SHORT NOTE : THIS IS LIFE..... WE KEEP MOVING</p>
<p>IF U EVER READ THIS I WILL NEVER FORGET U....</p>
