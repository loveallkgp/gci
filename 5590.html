<p>Hi admin &amp; everyone... I badly need some suggestion... Im 26 &amp; in a relationship with my love from 5 years...we are doing fine &amp; the best part is he has dedicated his life to me...we have so many plans in future, things are quite not well now as family pressurizing us to get married...but somehow we are managing to escape...we both are so madly in love with each other that he wants a gift of another life from me &amp; so do I...yeah that's OUR baby....we are dreaming for that since long back...I think now its time to think seriously about it... we are looking for a surrogacy... as we have very little knowledge about it I request you all to help us...like so many question pops out... 1) can we really have our own baby? 2) if yes, how? Where?.. what are the procedures we need to undergo?...which is the most affordable countrry 3)can We get Indian citizenship for our baby?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, surrogacy is expensive. People from west or other countries turn to India for surrogacy. While you are in India, adoption is a problem as well. It's good that you both are planning to stay together and start a family but the sad thing is that same sex parenting is not recognized by our constitution. I may be wrong because I don't know fully know the written laws.</h1>
