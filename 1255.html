<p>Hello everyone,
I am 20 . Its been more than a year that i have made this account, i always use to upload my half face pics i.e. mostly eyes and use to get a lot of likes etc. I always wished that i should upload my pics so that i will get more followers kind of thing but never did it as i m scared n also still in closet. I have a account on pr too and even there everyone keeps on asking to meet for a coffee etc and on fb too bt i have never met any1 uptil now as i m scared too meet people too (you never know what is in the mind of other person) is that what i think.
So basically what the main points is i never wished to get a bf frm internet, bt there seems no other resources to find gay people.
and whether should i upload pics or send to people in pr in messages (as no hot men continues the chat without pics) and number too.
all my chats end at the topic give ur no and send ur pics, i m too giving phone no too.
Please tell me what to do and post too since itna bada msg likha meine.</p>

<h1>Viv- You have trust issues. Some day or the other you have to take a leap of faith. Because of all of this insecurity you may loose someone who could really be with you. Even if you do get out to meet someone, do so at a public place where you will feel secure. Also, the genuine guys won't really ask you for your pics. Personal experience. ;)</h1>
