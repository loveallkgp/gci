<p>hi guys im frm manglore
karnataka.
im in a confusion state of mind.
i read most of d confessions here. its very clear that v dnt get our partners very easily. one who has found it will b d lucky 1.
i loved a guy he left me fr a silly reason. had gone under a very bad stage to forget him. i couldnt. Thought if i get a frnd like him i may forget. by lots of search in pr at last got a frnd frm mumbai. propsed him he too accepted. but i was wrong i couldnt forget my frst love, neithr i could give my 100% to d new frnd. Aftr a lot of thinking told d new frnd that im nt able to forget my old frnd. He was broken as i was. He felt that i used him to forget him. To a certain extent s. But i loved him. I couldnt forget my past to start a new life. Thought to tke a break. That break was horrible. Each moment was eating me up. Felt lonely in a crowded places. I was completely lost. I wanted a close frnd rathr than partner fr a time being. 
Wat should i do???
Should i go back to my new frnd (mumbai)
Or should i wait like this single fr a miracle to tke place???
Should i flow wth d current as it tkes me????
One more thinng wanted to tell that new mumbai frnd of mine is really good.
No bad habits trustworthy loving caring good looking
Bit possessive.
But i dnt knw wat
Chemistry doesnt match i feel.
He doesnt mkes me to forget my past.
Am i looking fr my ex in him???
Am i looking fr a replacement???
I really dnt knw.
Train has already started.
Suggest me should i climb d train or should i wait fr a next train.
Fully confused!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmm..dear dear u are in such a plight..ok lemme put it clearly for u...hope it helps!</h1>
<p>1- It is not about u being overflown with emotions and pains..its about treating other people as your masochistic co dependents and not allowing yourself to regrow.
2- Our love when it is deep &amp; when we come out of a relationship should makes us more responsible and makes us take charge of self happiness- and it does if we really SEE it.
3- The person who u feel any kind of connection afterwards remains a stranger until we really take a leap of faith to know the person in a new way. Remember ''love makes new parameters with new people every time''.
4-U must not enforce the fact that he was the source of your happiness...That is gravely wrong!
5- When the scenario changes (separation) either we become all consuming self obsessed assholes or we be with someone who act  like a drag(this is wt we think abt him)- In your case its not...Be proud of this fact!
6- Your new partner is not your therapist and you are not a case that needs to be fixed all the time..It leads to psychological abuse of your partner &amp; in turn makes the new relation toxic as well.
7-YOU can be very damaging by this kind of attitude and psychological abuse for him. Just clean your mind with PERIODIC CLEANING OF THOUGHTS. Accomodate new bliss! 
8- It can be emotionally draining the person who may carry this chain as started by you.
9- Be with someone whom you can like under all circumstances.</p>
<p>Love is not all about finding your masochistic co dependent because that leaves no space for you or your partner to grow!</p>
