<p>okay, i feel that i shouldn't write this but i am writing,
actually, i am 27 years old and i have a corporate job and we have a manager, he is my bf, we both are not married, he is 33, we both used to work over time so you know late in night when there was no one, we had informal chat and he asked me how's the work going and then she said he is looking for friends and he wants to be my friend and i accepted his request and he finally hugged me, it was not embarrassing, since there was no one but what i sensed was that his penis erected and he hugged me tightly and he kept his hands on my hair and then i decided to have sex with him, i always wanted to do so, he looked sexy and young and so i was always distracted in office whenever i saw him, so grabbed his face and i kissed him and we had sex in bathroom, we started having sex regularly at my home (i live alone) and in one year i got promotion and promise of increment in my salary annually. i don't regret that i got promotions through this method because i worked harder than others, made many presentations and gave creative ideas but my seniors took away all credits so they could get promotion.</p>
<p>$ABBY : see you shall not regret this . and we shall not judge this . you bothe are grown up men . what ever you two did if no one is hurt emotionally ..... then its fine and its matter of you two. and if that helped you in your career then its good too.. though  i don't suggest that but in life some of these compromises has to be done but good thing is you were not forced or thretened or used .</p>
