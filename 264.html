<p>please help! Ours is a secret relationship. I feel really helpless when he smokes and I want him to quit it. He too claims that he wants to quit and is trying to but, for some reason, he can't resist smoking. He has got a circle of friends who smoke and drink a lot. I just can't see him going deeper into the addiction. How do I convince him and bring him out of this trap? I just can't imagine loosing him at any point in my life, he is the biggest reason I am alive today....</p>
<h1>Viv- Try shock therapy. Take him to a hospital, into a ward of people who have throat cancer or show him photographs of people who die of tongue cancer, throat cancer or lung cancer. To everyone here, smoking is really really bad. If you smoke, you don't know how much you are ruining your life just for a few minutes of pleasure. Its not easy to quit though. You could buy him nicotine gums. They help in suppressing the urge of smoking. Moreover, there are many methods online. I'm sure you can try those too.</h1>
