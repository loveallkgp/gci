<p>Hi everyone.. first of all this is not a confession but i would consider it as seeking help from you all..
Am from NorthEast India. I have one major problem i.e, excessive unwanted hair. At first i wasn't like this but due to hormonal imbalance i suffered from this problem.. In most of your case being a mainland indian having hairs on hands,legs,chest,face,back etc its not a big issue however am from northeast state- Nagaland.. we are of the race with fewer hairs.. but am totally different because of my body hair..i feel so inferior,because of this hair problem my life is so down.. i cannot live freely.. Here people will often mock a person who has Thick dark unwanted hair unlike other parts of india most people prefer hairy..aam i right?
Coming back to my problem.. i have lots.. i can't wear shorts/vest..or any clothes that exposes body even during summer..i always wear long because i dont wont people to see my hair. I have once used razor which made it darker and thicker hair to grew on my body.. i dont want hair being a teenager its such a disgrace :-/
I have search lots of answers in google but couldnt find a good answer.. There are ways to remove body hair naturally but most of the ingredients i dont find.. i've tried turmeric too but it didnt work.. Maybe after 15/20years or so after i become independent i can go for a permanent hair removal treatment but as of now i need some best techiques of hair removal at home which is cheap..please leave me some good suggestion.thank you</p>
<h1>GCI- Well to those who mock you, you can say, "I just wish your balls were working properly to produce more testosterone." Being hairy is good, I feel. BTW, if you wanna do something then search if you get "thanaka powder(powder made from the bark of a Burmese tree) and safflower oil". The combo of these two can help you out but getting them is tough. It is a tries and tested ayurvedic method.</h1>
