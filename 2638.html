<p>What you people think about '' marriage of convenience '' ?
Or remaining unmarried is better .
And how to get a good partner for moc ?
I chatted with a lesbian girl on a moc website . She was 2,3 years elder to me ( i am 23 ) , and quite sincere type . Introductory chats were ok . But then i asked him some questions like ,will you want to have kid ( actually i want to have a kid ), how will be our sexual life , no sex at all ? 
Will i be allowed to keep relation with a single guy . Or i would go for sexual pleasures only ( and no attachment ) with one decent guy .
 telling my wife .
Or i will keep these things in hidden way . An indirect freedom will be given to me by her ?
Will she have a partner too , and how wil she manage her friends ?
Will i be strong enuf to allow her to date with gals . And if i allow her and she allow me . . . . .will there be any attachement remained in us ? Will that marriage stay for long .
That gal left me without answering my questions, and said i disappointed here .
Please is there anyone who may help me out with how moc's work</p>
<h1>GCI : see i totally think this type of relation won't keep anybody happy . what type of family values you will set to your kids. when they will see they parents are in denial and can't accept who they are and pretending a whole relationship and they will think that they are not part of a family but a circus show ( all mirage , all fake  )</h1>
<p>but again in society these things happen . its not just you who think like this . these 'conditions' depend on person to person ' like if they will get physical or nor , Will she have a partner too , and how wil she manage her friends ,? and there will be other problems like property issues ,  financial liberty , who will pay expenditures , and if you have kid who will own the kid if divorce happens , and as you are gay but you have pretended to be in heterosexual marriage by law you will be taken as heterosexual male and during divorce all the rules will apply on you as the rules apply on heterosexual male which means giving away 50% of your property to your wife and monthly expenditure to raise kids . </p>
<p>and what if inbetween relation she found a girl and decide to marry her and leave you or if you found a boy and want to marry him ??</p>
<p>and what if india makes gay marriage legal would you still prefer to stay in heterosexual marraige ( relation) . </p>
<p>there are so many pro's and con's but again its individual's choice how they want their life.</p>
