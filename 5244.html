<p>Ok so here's my story.
When I was 13 yo one of my cousin who was 4 years elder to me started to explore my body(yes I used the word explore because it wasn't abuse as I enjoyed it and wanted more of it) there was no anal sex. It continued for the next 4 years. It stopped when my cousin went out of The state for his further studies. At that point of time I stated having body play with my best friend. We both enjoyed it and did it at almost every oppturnuity we got. And I was always the "Top" n I enjoyed it. But then we both went our separate ways for our further studies. Then I was in a phase in my life where the "gay" part of my life took a complete back seat and I started dating chicks partying and stuff . Went on for the next couple of years. And then a couple of years my curiosity arose and I google about gay dating sites and I was just looking for a hook up so I met this guy he was also from My Goa so the 1st time I chated with him found him intrestin and we had the same intrest in music and he was a goth so that kinda got me more intrested in him. We spoke on the phone n all and after a month of being friends he asked me out and I said yes.but we went out just once and I me being new to dating a guy and with my big ego it was over. Then last year out of the blue he message me and then I just told him the I still have a soft corner for him and then he said he never got over me and we started dating again. And on 14 th feb we are going to complete one year together and it's been the most wonderful year of my life with him.</p>
<p>For him I became a "BOTTOM" n it was great because we love. Each other .</p>
<p>In conclusion I am a bisexual man in love with a guy. And we are in a live in relation. So please don't judge bisexuals as just sex seekers. We to are capable of love and affection towards another man.</p>
