<p>Hi Admin !!</p>
<p>I'm from south India..I'm 19..doing engineering third year...it's started wen I was in my first year..!!!</p>
<p>He was my roomie.. I still remember the first time we met..it was strange..cuz our eyes met,we looked into each others eyes for so long !!! he was so cute..and we became very close buddies..I loved him so much. but he didn't show any affection at the beginning..!! but oneday it changed.. it was Diwali holidays..we didn't go home..we decided to study for the exams... then suddenly he stopped studying and confessed his feelings towards me..I was shocked..he pulled me into his lap and kissed me..one thing led to another..we had *** that night..I was so happy that I got my love..but that happiness didn't stay too long.. after few days, he started ignoring me..he stopped talking, stopped responding messages,even changed his room..I was broken..I cried a lot..........
after two years, moved on..I still have feelings towards him..but I don't love him.. now he keeps on disturbing me.. he texts me daily even though I don't reply, two days before,he said tat he loves me n tried to kiss me..he apologised for everything,he said tat he was doing tat for my own good.... I'm so confused and angry...he keeps on pestering me..what should I do know ?? should I accept him or reject him..plz admin help me </p>
<h1>Viv- If he truly loved you he would have never left you. Maybe now he wants to make it right by coming back to you. Ask him first, "What good did he mean by leaving you?" and then make your decision if the reasons seem legit. Acceptance or rejection in a case like this must not be dealt early like anything.</h1>
