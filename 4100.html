<p>Same guy #4042 I think
....one wt the younger cousin problem
Okey I have had "the talk" wt him tryed to straightn thing up...so far it work..well at least he makeing an eye contact...i think he'll open up to me eventually right?..
Another thing is he is not aware of planetRomeo..
So I have three questions now
Do u think haveing an eye contact while talking is a sign of trust that he will share wt me everything?
Second ..should I tell him about the PR?
Third- I have friends (good guy not the fuck buddies) of his age group ....should I intro them to him...? Way of me looking out for him gaining trust is this wise ?</p>
<h1>GCI- Good job done by you. The step to be taken here can be about making him comfortable with himself. He might still be scared about his deed and from himself. Make him comfortable with himself and then with yourself that he can understand things better. Then you can introduce him with other guys.</h1>
