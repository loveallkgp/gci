<p>I met a guy here i was in love or lust with. Not sure. BUt Before meeting him i have had quite a proposals to flaunt only after exchanging pics. But i said no as they were not upto my standards. So when i met this guy one thing i was confirmed - he would be a hot mess. so i started taking to him but we fought , blocked each other and i left fb for forever. Forver means 6 months. i came back with new spirit but still ended up stalking his id.
Finally i sent him a request again and didnt tell hi anything about pass. Ironically i was faking on fake id. But i soon told him i love him for the past 6 months and he very sweetly rejected me. But i was not there give up on him. I told him i didnt care but i would love u always No matter u would lve or not.
so there started my efforts to impress him. I wrote him poems and songs which he liked too much. He had a thing for this. He liked my honesty and my love for him. i felt happy to do all such things. one day he asked me out and we met and talked about 6 hours . he told me he was an ex model and everything about his life. He invited me at his office and i went there.
While he got busy and i was staring at him constantly. Time has wings which i realized when i had to crash at his place coz got too much of late.Sharing the same bed and no action never poosibe. That day we had sex. Although next day i could believe i just had a moment with him last night. He opposed a little but carried away after all.</p>
<p>He didn't love me but we had sex. i thought it would be one time but i happened second , third , fourth and i stopped counting. But he never said i love you. He sexed me , care for me but never shown the Passion i had for him. I felt hurt though but never dare to change things.</p>
<p>In between there entered one more person in my life. My friend used to like him so i tried to check his nature -fake or real but the moment but we started talking we hit it off. . we developed a strange kind of bond without seeing each other pic. Soon he started to like me but i knew i love some1 else so i took it casually. i tried to cut off with him but i couldnt. We met twice and he was a guy u want to carry on bed by looks and well mannered enough u can introduce to parents. He could score any guy he wanted but he fell for me strange.</p>
<p>We kept in touch and chatted with each other daily and somewhere realized he was in love with me. Though too afraid to propose me officially. I too started to like him.</p>
<p>one point i was having sex with my love and but on the other point thinking about him. But with time i thought my affection for the first guy faded away and i didnt call or message him for for weeks. Even i ignored his calls. While chatting with other guy daily. i started to feel for him.</p>
<p>one day he completely blew me away and said i only used him for sex. BUt i didnt. I told him i love him but he never said back. I went physical with him without having a relationship. But he never forced me although and it was my choice.
The second guy never expected anything apart to be with me. I told him everything about me and my love my friend. he got angry and came back next day. We got it smooth but i used to do alot of drama. i even broke up with him few times but always went back when became normal.
i know i was not best for him so i broke up one day permanently and left but could resist more than 15 days. s i went back but this time things had turned up. he accepted me but all the charm vanished off, we were not on same edge now. After few days he left me coz he gotta go married.</p>
<p>so i was frustrated enough to handle the pressure for few weeks. Then i thought joining in for physical relationship would help me to move on. also why should waste my life now. I was young meant to enjoy my life. I joined in PR more reliable and accessible for sex encounter.</p>
<p>soon i found a guy went to his place had sex but not so good feeling and so again i went on . IF you have a cute face people would take you in. I found new object and had sex . again not happy happening. This i thought i would searched someone with hot muscles. So i Had sex with a muscle guy . I liked it a little. So i wanted to take things to another so i went with a threesome. Omg that was worst decision i could not look myself in mirror now. I did nyt enjou a bit . i ran as soon as it was over. i Hv learnt myself lesson. Sex is boring . really its boring until you have some1 who loves you or u love him. i love sex with fst guy coz i knew i love him and he cared for me. i wanted to get ot out my system. I dont want advice or anything, It just a confession. </p>
<h1>Viv- Haven't I already said that no matter how many time we have sex with random strangers, we always dream about having special moments to share with our loved one in the end? Yep I did. And this confession proves my view. BAM!</h1>
