<p>Hey first of all thanks to admin of dis page. First time i am writing abt my confession and want some advice from u guys. After breaking in 2010 i give mylife a new start in 2012 i met with one guy from Pr he is from mumbai and i am from gujarat he is basically from gujarat but for his studies he was in mumbai he comes to once or twice in a month at that tym we meet each other. Initially he was egoist and little bit arrogant but i find him as honest from his heart and i was not that mature so i thought in relationship we must adjust and he himself told me because of his parents he is dis way. i used to complain him because he dont respond me neither attend my calls properly. so when i met him i told him he told me that even he is not picking up his mother calls so i adjusted for that. he told me that he can talk with me only around 10.30 to 11 so i accepted because i feel that he is even have personal life n his schedule is hectic so i adjusted for it even though i wants to talk to him as we dont meet often.   once i met with accident and i was unable to b in contact with him for 10days as my cell was switched off n i was hospitalised then he called me after 10days i told him everything but he didnt bother much but i din like dat as my friends are caring for me and he din. so i discuss with my friend he told me that i must check him. When we met for the first time he told me that he need time to give our relationship as we cant b committed instantly and i liked his view. But i deleted my pr account n i told him to delete but he refused to do dat. i adjusted for it as i trust him. My friends checked him as stranger so he told my friend about me as guy who loves him alot and m very sweet but he told my friend that he is confused because of my young age and he feels guilty dat he cant reciprocate me in same way n he starting doing flirting with my friend and they decided to share phone number then my friend told him about his real identity then they got into severe argument and at that time my friend told my bf that he loves me too and m god for him but he is bisexual and he is engaged with a girl and i was unaware then when i come to know about this my friend told me dat he is not good guy he is selfish he will ruin my life but i felt  that my bf is serious about me thats y he discuss think abt me and because of jealous my friend gives me wrong advice. we started everything new but i was unaware that his behaviour completely changed and become more rude and later on i come to know about that he is behaving with me just because i checked him i told him that he provoked me to do dat for me loyalty is my priority i told him that he dont have time to reply me and talk with me but he chatted with my friend for back to back days n we had quarrels and we brokeup then after 3months he called me and told me that he is ready to commit and he wants  me to b his lifepartner and he is ready to open up with his family i was so happy dat after being in 2year dat for first time to told me that words and we started everything new but i lost my job and i got into severe problem but he din bother me and my problem but m expecting some care but he din he accused my dad that just because of him i have to work otherwise i must concentrate on my studies but my dad is my hero and i told him that he dont have rgt to say dis and after that he stopped call me and msging even i used to call him sent messages and whenever he get mood he talks with me i gifted him nice gift after that he started taliking politely but he still arrogant dont at all give me time to talk and at same time neither responds me sometime just for his reply i say "I BEG" i feel so painful i told him" do u love me" he tell me dat there is nobuddy who can take my place in his heart but i feel that if loves me then y i dont commit me he always use to show my limitations but he dont accept me d way i m. i feel like that he playing safe with me because he knows that m only person who undstd his complex nature give him space at same time loving him so truly but at same time he dont want to commit me so dat i can question him he used me as m feeling. some days back he  told me dat  he engaged with a girl and he told me dat i din commit me so he din ditch me i knew dat he can do dat then he told me dat he was just teasing me. whenever he used to meet me personally he behaves like he is only person who loves me so lot he din even care what ppl will think hold my hands and going everywhere but when he reached his place he behave differently i dont know wat is their in his mind sometime i feel that he loves me but at same time i feel if a person loves me he wont hurt to his beloved but he always use to dat sometime he says such bad things which i cant forget but then too just for my feelings i adjust and i done so many things for him two years i m living my life just for oneday that he accept my love and he is ready to commit but he din he told me that he loves me but he cant commit and he wants to pay attention towards his carrer but i never come in between his carrer he never used to call him or msg him while he is in office neither while he do his studies but once in 10 or 15days i want to talk to him but then too he din give me or pickup my call even i call him after so many days so i need to call him from someanother number then too he talk with me only for 20mins or like dis way i told him neither you call me if i call u then u dont talk with me and tell me that ur busy so wat i must do so now he get one thing to say that he know dat he never do justice with me and m best person in this world n i deserve someone else. even on my bdae he give me option to go with some1 else but at same time he tells me dat i cant give some1 my place in his heart and he feel hurted then i ask him then y he dont adjust for few things and we can live a gud life but he never reply me. There are so many which i cant write here. so now friends please give me some advice wat i will do because i feel that he just playing with my emotions and he want some dog but at same time i cant control my feelings.</p>
<h1>GCI : there are so many points i want to share of my best knowledge .</h1>
<p>as your bf (as you call him ) said he is this way coz of his parents.. so maybe he has had a worst childhood  , maybe his parents fight with each other ( domestic violence) , or maybe they argue a lot and never gave their kid attention much . but this thing has made him much better person. he is emotional and mature and knows the value of relationship . 
plus i think he is introvert ( not a negative point but a character) . he might not be into calling uselessly and might be he hate calling . he might be direct person and feels comfortable talking face to face face . 
more thing is he don't want to rush into things . like today dating , next week bf and few months later hubby .. no he is emotional and introvert person you have to win his heart . he don't need insecurity . also he wants a mature person and as you said you are younger then him so its difficult for him. plus he wants career oz he want to be financialy secure and then bump into a relationship. ( so can't you two just date for 3 - 4 years and know each other well ). </p>
<p>NOTE : never ever bring any third person in your relationship . be it your friend or brother or sister . this will give a bad idea about your 'situation handeling skills' and your lover will think that you are immature and can't take your own decisions . 
he is totally right by being rude as he got to know that you were spying on him.. you two aren't even in relation yet </p>
<p>but other things can be there too </p>
<ol>
<li>he might be a slow person in relations</li>
<li>he is looking for somebody better or mature or maybe his own type
3 . he is insecure and don't want to trust you yet .</li>
</ol>
