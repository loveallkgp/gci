<p>I want to share about my experience. I stumbled upon him through GCI. It started as a normal chat. I was a depressed and he too seemed so. We started chatting and connected very well with each other. He has awesome sense of humor and the ease that I always desired in a person. We kept on chatting for months and somehow I got some courage to share my number with him and since then we talk almost everyday. My morning alarm is his call. The moment I hear his voice my day brightens up.  It's long distance relation (can't say relationship as it displeases him tongue emoticon ). I am in Punjab (but not Punjabi) and he is in Hyderabad. We haven't met yet and don't know when we will meet. We had our share of fights and misunderstandings. He thinks he is ruining my life because this relation has no plausible future. Upon his suggestions I tried talking to some people..perhaps many but I didn't connect with anyone. Some judged me for my looks, some wanted just for sex, some abused and criticized for unable to yield to their demands, some  were nice but only in their comfort zones. When I told some that I am not OK, they suggested that I have to deal it alone.  Only with him I realized the meaning of love. He never demanded anything from me. He accepted me as I am. He everyday manages sometime from his excessively busy daily schedules. Even if it is for five minutes he tries to ensure that if I am OK and everything around me is all right. He cares without any conditions. I am happier since I came to know him. I know that in near future our distance will become more and have no idea what future has to offer me but believe me it's beautiful. This whole feeling and experience is beautiful. It's one and half years and want to add many more years to it. The moment I think about you my soul becomes calm and content. Yes, the future perturbs me sometimes but I am happy that at least I experienced the purest form of love. 
Thanks GCI for having some nicest people on earth, here.</p>
