<p>This is my first confession here,And i know it wud be selfish for me to say Admin plz post this, rather i wud expect you to read it ....n then if it worth to b posted, do it !!
Let me introduce u wid myself... m frm new delhi,22 yrs , Btech final year, n yet anothr engineer. Im placed now, grace of god....d only thing happend nice to me here.
I never feel right about myself , stricting to the fact i wont b able to love a gal .... thn a boy. Had been to a relation fr abt 1.6 yrs, which once started wid all the zeal n devotion, Ended up wid no explanation, no complaints. Surprisingly i nvr thot it cud b over, Sumhow i managed....to accept d fact !!
Im a guy ok... to those who go fr appearence im good lukin guy, yes i approached to gals but nvr ever cud go along wid them in these 4 yrs. I sit by this vacant seat evrytym,,,,,,invest my mind mostly thinking worse,You knw once this guy was a jolly thing n far happiest . But now he's find missed out of world, I watch my footsteps rather to the street where i go. I pity myself ... is this bcoz i was gay! No... becoz i hd known tht forever, Its bcoz i'v been ditched/accused for wat i havnt had done . I cant blame him, even i should, which is also a killer. Dad says.. Gays r unnatural....only if he wud know his son is one too, I find no peace these days. I look back... i found myself more happy wen i had him. But i also knw it wont happen thn he'd bck n i will hug n accept him. He has moved on, but i havent , i waitd for him for abt 5 mnths now. Those guys say.. str8 r best, gays r dykes n gals... but i m even bettr thn them in many things,,,, i swim, i play volley bettr thn thm. Only i dont laugh much... i dnt knw how to show off bods, they do to impress those cheap gals....who r wid thm today. I dont ineract, i fear if ever i go along wid ny friend (guy) i wud b attached. So i stopped this habit of makin friends now...the guy once hav lots of frnds...now go alone to room. I barely sleep good these days....I wish i cud b wid 1 of tht guy whoz livin my lyf too. I luk away n stare ppl sitting alone or standing, feel as if they'd b thinking abt this...too !!</p>
<p>Ps- if u really paid attention... thnk yuh..Or if you found fake ... Then go ahead n say watevr...It hardly matters...
Im alrdy facing worst.... The city where im living was once my shimmering mirage, But now its haunted wid memos...Only 2 mnths left im gonna leave this place. May be i wrote much but..
its been years i said a thing to anyone....... !! </p>
<h1>Viv- There is so much darkness coming out of your confession. First of all, why do you have to be judgemental about your friends? Thats the reason you don't have any friends. Second, moving on is tough. The more you gloom in the dark, the more sad you are going to be. You are lonely, you had post break up sadness. Am I the only one to see that you are yourself amplifying the melancholia inside you? Try being social the next time you go to college or even out of your home. It can really take your mind out of that darkness. All you need is some light in your life. Get it.</h1>
