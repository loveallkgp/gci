<p>just post it.. not a confession .. i wish to express my feeling on social site HI there.......... What I supposed to do be a gay in India. its now making fuck myself. There no freedom to be what i am. Is that the freedom what we brought .???. There is no unnatural in love. love is a pure thing..... and it is going to celebrate with whom i want and what i want. Is that i hold my boyfriend hand and kissed him make any problem with you dickheads. I know that i like boys. I know my sexual orientation better than everyone. You straight fucking guys don't know ..... Being gay is not a easy one. I'm acting form my age 12 to still now. you won't get my problem. I was affected form your bullying and threatening. I can't get any close friend. I'm so afraid that he might leave me by knowing my sexuality. i cant afford this anymore... its not a freedom i got. I'm not asking pity. i want my rights. Ready for the battle............ I never change my self to anyone.. its my life let me live my life in ma country. don't push me to go some other country</p>
