<h1>Story by #OceanWave I was born to be someone, I knew it from the beginning, someone famous whom the world will remember and say ''that guy, that guy was Mark who is still chainging our life.'' but now I know I wasn't born to be someone, I was 'someone' who was born and evryone is born that way.</h1>
<p>I always wanted to be an author/novelist, just a writer. I think that even shortest n simplest words could bring about a big change. And the change that happened in my life was just because of a little word 'hope'.
Like every queer individual, I too fought for my identity, i too faced the hardships.. But i didn't give up because he was beside me, my hope- Lenkha. He is still there with me in that little word 'hope'. Yes, he is in a deep long sleep now. I remember, I met him during a pride parade in banglore and he was wearing a T-shirt with the logo hope. I was astonished when I talked to him, he used 'hope' in almost every sentence. I was convinced that he was crazy. And when I asked the reason, he said, ''I know I might sound stupid and strange but this is who I'm. I believe we are here for some reason and thats why we all are unique and 'someone' special and I hope I'm doing my job well. I say this word 'cause I've met people who knew their lifespans and I found this word much more powerful than anything.''
Later I came to know he himself was suffering from chorionic cancer. He didn't know his lifespan as he never wanted to know it, but he didn't have much time left. I fell in love with him, we made a great couple, he changed my life and soon departed with a smile and a hope that I would meet him somewhere someday in some other form soon... His last words were, ''I hope u don't disturb me with the water and do dirty things when I sleep.'' with a wink and a smile.</p>
