<p>hiii, im 19 years old. but still very sweet sa chota sa pyala bacha iam  ^_^. So i love me. </p>
<p>One fine day, I along with my friends went to market. We enjoyed. I saw 'panipuri' and asked fellow mates to have it. One of the girl said "are you gay ?", and I was shocked. I kept staring at her, gathering all possible logical explanations of "gay and panipuri" connection on my mind. Anyway, they laughed, though we had it. I am not girlish(or any other thing which makes me vulnerable to be labelled as gay). It was absurd to me(on whatever basis she called me 'gay'). We all are well educated(my friend circle), yet I fail to understand what people are up to these days. I mean, wtf is rong with them. Kuch bhi. Ye bhot choti si baat thi, yet im scared that are these small small things related to us? (But pani puri is love of life &gt;.&lt;) </p>
<h1>GCI- You should have replied, "Oh honey, why do you care, this pani puri is not shaped like a dick, is it?"</h1>
