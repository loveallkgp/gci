<p>This all started when i was in class 10. Year 2006. I met him the first time in KV Pathankot(my school) . I was a new admission, low in academics,bad at sports, a dumb back bencher. At that time i was still discovering myself . I was an average looking guy with lack of self confidence. World was a challenge for me.</p>
<p>His name was Vihaan Yadav. He was a chilled out guy, a bright student. Everygirl of my school wanted to b his girlfrnd. Anyone would easily fall in love with him.</p>
<p>It was almost a week, no one even noticed dat i exist. One fine afternoon he came upto me in sports period. it was the first time we had a word. I found him attractive. I dont know what he noticed good about me and raised his hands from frienship.</p>
<p>He changed everything within me in 3 mnths now i was more studies, confidence grew, my dressing statmnt changed. And i was one among the popular crowd of the class. He changed me . We happend to b best friends.i started loving him. His confidence in me developd me progressively day by day. I made my parents happy. My teachers were happy. Vihaan was happy. And his happiness made me do even better. I was finally in deep love with him. Sometimes he used u say "i luv you yaar" and smile. But i thought it was jst a frndship affection he displayed.</p>
<p>More than a year passed . I was happy n satisfied. I was in 11th . By then it was like we were habitual of each others company. Same bench, till 2 o clock, then 3 hours coaching together and again 2 hours of walk together in d evening. My affection and sense of longing towards him grew stronger day by day.</p>
<p>One day my parents went back to my home town . I was alone. Vihaan's mom  sent dinner for me with Vihaan. At night we were sleeping together. Suddenly we came close and we became intimate. Yes we  discovered each other. The touch were so happening. I loved the fragrance of his body.He closed his eyes and let me touch every part of his body. He devoted himself totally. And the passionate intimacy made our bond more strong. </p>
<p>Days passed having s*x became our routine. We were in twelfth by then. We promised each other to stay togethr no matter what. We realised we cant liv without each other. Everything was fine. 
All of a sudden everything changed. Vihaan once failed in mathematics in 1st preboard exam. And one day his mother caught us together intimate. Colors of my life suddenly fade. His mother dragged me out of her house. He dint tell anyone neither she talked about it i kno. But after dat day I lost Vihaan. He dint talk to me till our boards. Neither he messegd me. it affected our results badly. I got 82 % and he got only 87%. </p>
<p>After exams he came once to me .we had a brief chat.he said no matter what he'll love only me but noone else.but he cannot go against his mother for his own happiness. He asked me to promis to make a good carrier and wont let this affect my life for the sake of his happiness. I promised him. He kissed me and went away tears in his eyes. I was numb.</p>
<p>In some corner of my heart i know, he will come back to me. As per his promis to his mother he never messegd or call me. Nor did i try. One day i got a call from his mother on 25 november 2013,exactly  ten days  after his 22nd birthday . After 5 years i went to see him in faridabad. Wen i saw him in hospital my life was snatched off. My Vihaan was dying . Doctors could never tell what has happened to him exactly accept for his health was continuosly declining. I hugged him tight. He was smiling at me. He again asked for a promis. Only thing he demanded always is promises. He asked me to "Live " after he dies. Evrything seemed a nightmare. I stayed with him for last 3 days of his life. My Vihaan died . His mother screamed "i killed my son" . No one could ever make out what did she mean. I knew. But nthing i could do . My Vihaan was gone. Far away.</p>
<p>I am still keeping a promis made to him. I m married now. My wife Tara know evrything  about me and Vihaan now. I hav a little 1 year "Vihaan" now as my son. And i m happy. </p>
<p>This is Tara  who is making this confession on Abhay's (my Husband) behalf. I want all those parents to know my husband's story. i want them to realize if they ruin their "Vihaan's" happiness unknowingly.and lament over it later.</p>
<h1>GCI- I don't know whether the last part is real or not, but if it is totally true then Tara and Abhay, u made me cry, u made the admin cry after a very long time on this page.....U made me wail and weep like a child.</h1>
