<p>It's not that i am attracted to any of my cousins but whenver i see them, i find them to be handsome, whenver i view their facebook profile, they put their pics in which they look ultra handsome with their girlfriends, (and i must make it clear that i never had any desire too have sex with them). sometimes i think that they used to look so stupid, how there faces evolved in such a way in their last years of adoloscence and in my case, my face evolved to be the most ugliest face in the whole city, people don't look at me, everyone avoids me, my cousins look down on me, girls and boys try to stay away from me, my parents internally regret, they didn't know that their random mixture if genes would make me look extremely ugly,no cosmetic technology can reverse this effect, most saddest thing is that my elder brother looks more handsome than ranbeer, my cousins consider him idol and they praise him like he is a god, he is straight and changes his girl friend in every 2 months!!!!! I don't like when my parents click selfies with him and upload on facebook, they never do this with me, earlier this saddened my heart but now i don't feel anything anymore. My brother, probably because i am ugly, ignored me everytime, never introduced me to his friends. It doesn't matter if ppl avoid me but they shouldn't pass comments on me. Some may write that people in this world sufffer lot more problems than what i am suffering from but i am the only one who knows that how much this society has hurt me.</p>
<p><em>cursed genes</em></p>
<h1>GCI- Damn those people who pay much more attention to looks. They are the most shallow people on earth! When it comes to family, it shouldn't really matter! Seriously, what kind of family you have got? But hang in there buddy, don't loose confidence. Work on your career and make yourself a great success. Those who are ignoring you today will crawl back to you one day.</h1>
