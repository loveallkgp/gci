<p>It was in 1991 when I was 15 year old I realised that I am homosexual, it was really disturbing for me, unluckily I fell in love with a bold and strong guy of class, and he also concluded this from my gestures,, Instead of understanding my feelings he started teasing me and made my life a hell, worst part, on a school trip he raped me with another friend of him,, I became so upset,, that I missed the school that year, there was no one in my life with whom I can share or tell about that incident due to shame n fear, and that incident made a great impact on my personality, I became so introverted that I was unable to make friends after that, I.met 3 gay boys in 2000, and I made sex with them.and got attached with the one, but none of them was ready to become a life time partner, instead they chose to marry a girl and are now fathers and living a happy married life, 
Even the persons who raped me forgot that incident and living a happy family life, 
but I m all alone, no one is in my life, finding a gay partner is impossible for me now at the age of 40, 
did I made a mistake that I not married a girl.,as I see almost all the gays of my.generation are married and living happily</p>
<p>I don't know how to pass the remaining life?? </p>
<h1>GCI- U made the best decision..Trust this!</h1>
<p>U are just truthful to ur soul and this is why u didn't got marry to a girl..
If u follow this page then do see the confessions of yesterday...A man in his 60's confessing that he made the biggest mistake by marrying a girl....because BEING PSYCHOLOGICALLY ALONE WITH SOMEONE IS EQUAL TO BEING ALONE IN A CROWD!!</p>
<p>SALUTE TO YOUR INTEGRITY!!</p>
