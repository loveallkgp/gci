<p>Hey everyone..
Hope u r fine this february....the season of love....I want to ask something from u all....How does it feel when u go to meet someone on valentines who is not ur date....ur dream guy or ur love...u just go to make him feel good because he loves u truly without any expectation....u spend all day talking about urself and about the guy u love and also ask about his life which made him the way he is today....because this is what he wanted from u....ur time for a single day....and who knows u so much virtually to reality that u r surprised at times....now some people will ask here..why choose valentines??? because of the simple reason of having issues with my guy(don't even know i should call him my guy or not)...anyways that person knew me for the last 9 months and had changed from a drag to a platonic lover...he considers me his platonic love...On meeting him he was so happy that he even said that he hadn't thought that I would really come...he is almost a good looking guy with a good sense of photography and teaching as a computer teacher...I will say goodlooking because he considers himself average....he says that everyone around him says that he is a changed and refined person now...and he owes that to me...I was obliged and felt privileged...That person trusts me so much that he can never say that i can hurt someone deliberately....He even brought my favourite "mishti dahi"( a sweet delicacy of bengal) and smiled at me all through the day seeing me blabbering....Man he had remembered it and made me feel special and worthy... At one point of time during our conversation I said I feel so selfish...but he said don't feel that way...love cannot come forcibly....u only had told me this...He even said that u can do so much for a guy who loves u....and I can surely say that u will create milestones in love whom u will love truly by heart and soul...that made me emotional at that time because it was true...We sat all day on the bank of Ganges and talking about life and love and complications we face in it...We even roamed the area and stared at goodlooking guys..loL..his gaydar is so weak!! Lastly when it was time to get parted in the train I saw his eyes which were gleaming with joy and a heavy heart because he came half the way with me on my route to bade me goodbye...he told me I got more than enough from u when u fulfilled my wishes to caress u on the head u and kiss u in the cheek and on the forehead....his parting words were...That guy who would see ur soul would be ur love bcoz u don't want anything else from ur love...I will pray for ur happiness and well being ...ALWAYS...
I wish god bless him always and he remains as good and truthful as he have turned forever..
I know u will read this...its my tribute to u for ur true love and above all JUST LOVE...</p>
