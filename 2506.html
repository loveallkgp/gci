<p>Don't u guys and the admin get scared ??? I mean Wht if the cyber police gets after u??? After all SC has made gays illegal. </p>
<h1>GCI- I'm not even a single bit scared. Want to hear a revelation? Here it goes.</h1>
<p>IPC 377 states that, "Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."</p>
<p>Easier version- Being gay is not illegal. Its the sexual act, i.e. anal sex that has been made illegal. And it does not only apply to gay people but also to heterosexual people who even indulge in both oral and anal sex. So according to the text, only penile-vaginal sex is according to the order of nature.</p>
<p>PS- No one can put you in jail just for being gay. To charge you under IPC 377 the police should have proper medical reports that you have had anal sex, whether passive or active.</p>
<p>PPS- Don't live under fallacy. Hope you are much more in clarity now. Spread your fucking rainbow then!</p>
