<p>Well !! Finally after a year ..I am writing my story..it's long so..please bear folks !!
I am 21 from Kolkata.. I had a crush on my classmate in std 11..we were best of friends.we shared every bits and pieces ..Those 2yrs were best of my life..v were like a single soul in different bodies :p He was very charming and a decent person..I liked everything about him..he was also very much interested talking to me,sharing things..He used to hold my handshands,even kiss on my cheeks etc..But he never confessed anything..After that he went to Bangalore for higher studies..I was left out in Kolkata..Then some misunderstanding cropped up between us..soso now after 4 long years..we do talk but not with that same zeal and affection..we don't shareshare things and are more like a stranger!! I love him badly even today..every day I see his pics ,adore him..I have given hints at time to him that I love him..BT he didn't responded..I don't know what he is upto..whether he is a gay or bisexual ,loves me or loves me not..so confused confused confused  and is trapped in dilemma what to do...I don't want to loose whatever little frndshp is left between us !! 
Admin you are doing a good job !! Keep going ;) :) love u loads .</p>
<h1>GCIL- Ok! Love accepted, but your stupidity...no no na na na no(In harriet's style of 90s show Small wonder).</h1>
<p>Just understand that if you don't lose a few friends you didn't grow. And if u still want to cling onto ur past...be my guest and be a drag for urself. Happy ruining of life!! Tada!</p>
