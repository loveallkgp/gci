<p>I think its really very important for all bottoms there to understand and think over these lines which I have mentioned below .... </p>
<p>1) have u bottoms ever thought why are we all treated like a " sex machine " </p>
<p>2) have u all bottoms thought about the education , the background , our upbringing which our parents have given to us ?? 
3) have u bottoms there ever cared about ur self respect , principles , morals , identity &amp; individuality </p>
<p>4) is sex the only food and the only wish and want in ur life .... </p>
<p>Guys .. how can u just be so blind over such a small aspect of life ... </p>
<p>5) is not embarrassing for u when people treat u like whores and u guys actually say yes to them and prove ur self a whore .. .. </p>
<p>Guys plz understand . Ur self respect has it own value .. ur identity has to be respected .. u just can't let someone degrade u .. improve ur quality guys ..  sex is just an atomic part of life ... being girly is not a crime but being desperate standing naked is disgusting ,  craving for sex 24x7 is just waste of time ,.... if u really want people to love u then improve ur quality within ... by being desperate u ll just be a whore and a sex machine ... and nothing else ... which we bottoms are not .  </p>
<p>Yes we are soft but we aren't girly , we are emotional but we aren't dumb , we are cute and good looking but we are not cheap whores , we bottoms are gays who stand for love not sex ....</p>
<h1>GCI- Wow! So much bottom empowering! I really did choke everytime whenever you mentioned the word bottom.</h1>
<p>Now let me get straight on your ass.
1) Speak for yourself. You cannot force everyone to have a same thinking like yours. If someone likes no strings attached sex, its their choice. Not something you should worry about. Those who seek love will seek love. Those who seek sex, let them be. You really shouldn't interfere in anybody's business unless they harm anyone. And if you, of all people will seek just sex, nobody would judge.</p>
<p>2) If you get treated like a sex machine then the person who does the active is a whore too. </p>
<p>3) Some gays(irrespective of their position) are girly. GET OVER IT AND ACCEPT THE FACT. If you can't, let me come and clean your mind with bleach.</p>
<p>4) For the last time, STOP MAKING YOUR POSITION AS YOUR FUCKING IDENTITY! It's just a position in bed. Does your genes screams "We make this guy a bottom" every time? NO! Stop objectifying people with the use of this word. Whenever you use this word, you stand against everything you believe in. You talk about respect, yet every sentence of yours has the word bottom.</p>
