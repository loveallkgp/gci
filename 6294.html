<p>Hey guys pls dont be desperate for sex so much .. Only this gives the reason for everyone to make fun of us.. Everyone here thinks being gay means a guy who is desperate to have sex with a guy... I know its very difficult to control ur emotion, but u can atleast try.. Try to change our reputation in this society..im telling here some points which we can follow to improve our reputation and change others thinking about us.
1)dont chase a guy very much until u r sure that he's gay..
2) never try rendomly on straight guys.
3)try to b loyal with ur partner
4)dont make fun of effeminate guys in front of ur straight ffriends
5)try to teach ur straight friend abt the gays, that every gay is not like wat they thinks, but dont tell him abt u.
6)always try to b successful, and make a strong carrier,
7)tell ur friends that u r a lgbt supporter, since they r human too, but dont open up in front of them..</p>
<p>Pls comment more suggestion... Guys we need to change the mantality of our society.. Dnt think MAI AKELA KYA KAR SAKTA HU.. may b har koi kisi k pahal karne ka intezar kar rha ho..... Tk care...bbye..</p>
<h1>GCI- Your points are appreciable but some of these come from personal experiences. When you get hit, that's when you learn. You can always tell them to new people but it is hard for them to understand. Until and unless someone self-realize and self-analyze, a person cannot understand.</h1>
