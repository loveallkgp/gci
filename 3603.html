<p>Well  being a feminine gay, I can understand the plight of the so called masculine 'straight acting' gay men. It must be hard for them when society stereotypes the entire gay community as feminine. 
While it is PERFECTLY OK , NATURAL AND AWESOME,for someone to be feminine, I do believe such people (straight acting) do feel underrepresented in the media and the society.
Common people we are fighting stereotype. Dont you see every gay contestant BIG BOSS has hired has been a flamboyant, fabulous diva from fashion industry (which is GREAT).
But leave alone masculine gays, even so many feminine gays are not that 'flaming' or 'divalicious' . Big boss hires such people to increase TRP and create a freak show( according to audience)
You must remember, prominent gay right activist Harish Iyer was interviewed for big boss season 1, but was rejected as he refused to be the characteristic diva and refused to act like  a drama queen.
I will emphasis once more, I have NOTHING against feminine gays ( Hell I am a proud one :) ) but since we follow the motto "BETTER TOGETHER", We must understand the dilemma our 'straight acting' peers might have to face( just like we have to face bullying and other stuff).</p>
<h1>GCI- Awww you made it sound so better. Those fussy lads be feeling like bullied by the society now. Now now babies, come up here and I will make you some hot cocoa to keep you sane.</h1>
