<p>I am the confessor of the confession number #4801 where I have confessed about my love and desire for sex with Tappu.....</p>
<p>First of all a great thanx to Atherv Khandelwal and Siddique Shabeer for understanding the feelings and love.</p>
<p>Now coming back to the point......guys this confesssion was not true at all....I was here to give you all guys a lesson.</p>
<p>Let's 1st understand the problem</p>
<p>Pyaar andha hota ha.......If I am in true love with Tappu....that love will also give me a desire to have sex with him.....wats wrong in that?
Admin and all other says he is a teenager.....So Wat???? Did I had sex with him? cant my feeling grow for a cute teenager who is super hot??? wats wrong?</p>
<p>And here is the conclusion....</p>
<p>You guys reacted so badly on me without thinking of my feeling, as if I raped the teenager....
Some of u called me chutiya also.....
You guys want gay rights to be passed without understanding ur own peoples feelings....</p>
<p>than just think....when a straight guy who never can imagine a sex scene among 2 boys.....start laughing on us or crack jokes on us....than he is also not wrong.</p>
<p>we laugh on our own feelings and blame others....and expect them to respect us....</p>
<p>Admin.....atleast your answer in that post should be like this "We really understand ur feelings but....he is a celebrety u cant get him.....and 2nd he is a teen....so controll your emotion"
Admin you r our proud.....people confess here to get ur good advise, ur sympathy, and u should not give a statement which looks funny on the confessor....</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, I don't know how to sugarcoat my words. I say what comes in my mind and I know I can be bitchy sometimes. But you have to admit that it was kinda creepy from your side. It was my immediate reaction.</h1>
