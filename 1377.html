<p>This page rocks!! \m/ well I had my first bf wen I was 17.. I fell in love with him instantly wen I saw his eyes ... Its like in can see his soul too.. We date for like 1yrs and we eventually apart coz of work and less communication ... But then he came again after a month with a flowers and chocolate .. And with those beautiful eyes.. (Which he knows its my weakness) and proposing me again saying he have left urgently to he's country( he's Egyptian) and I accepted coz I love him more than anything and I think everyone deserve a second chnce. Loving him give me strength .. and makes me happy knowing someone love u even wen ur sad and makes me smile abit again :) but every things change wen he invited to his apartmnt .. While he's taking showr I check his lap try to see sum video song..! Nightmare comes wen I suddnly click one video and him and his roomate having sex in front of the lapcam.! Dame how's stupid I was taking him him back again.. (And thos eyes temp me) I asked him whts the meaning of this? He's din speak a word .. To my horror its seem he's inviting us to do threesome with that gay wos hiding inside his room.. I say I can share everything with him food/money etc but not ma bf .. But wtDaHell go and f*<em>k him as much as u want nw.. M otta diz!! It took me 2yrs to overcome.. He crushh me like hell .. Despite the good things fall apart better thing fall together in my life nw.. My present bf is Pilot and we live in togethr. For almost 2yrs nw.. He's orphan and m orphan too.. #weAreInLove :</em> Bangalore!</p>
<h1>Viv- Good! Story with a happy ending! Keep the love blooming, bitches! :*</h1>
