<p>I don't know how eventful is gay child adoption. The reason is that how can a gay give mothers milk to a child, do they have those maternal feelings. and it is so unfortunate to the child to grow without a mother who is a form of god. It might lead to the child facing unfair discrimination as gays are often wrongly ridiculed bye people </p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, indian law does not allow two men to adopt kids. Even a single guy cannot be allowed to adopt male kid. That is about the law.</h1>
<p>Scientifically it has been proven that gay people have the mindset of both guys and girls built in their brains. Both partners can be mother and father of the children. In the west where gay couples can adopt, children there turn out to be completely normal. I don't think that any gender is required in the family. Its all love that matters.</p>
