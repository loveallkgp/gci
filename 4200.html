<p>Hi.. I have been following your updates from a month. You are simply awesome. I am a LGBT right activist from Bengaluru. I am trying to educate LGBT in Karnataka about gay rights, section 377, STI's and other basic things every LGBT person must know. Please share this link on your page and ask them to like it. Thank you. https://m.facebook.com/gaybengaluru?_rdr</p>
<p>Bengaluru Pride page discriminating against #DragQueens #CrossDressers #Androgynous #Transgender people. Also asks not to wear sandals &amp; flip flops. They tell you to be yourself, then they judge you. What do you all think? Gay Bengaluru does not support any kind of discrimination.</p>
<ul>
<li>last sentence, I posted this on my page</li>
</ul>
<h1>GCI- This is ridiculous. The main  motive of organizations or clubs like this is to accept everyone as they are. Everyone has a particular style of fashion and frankly our community has some amazing people who think beyond the gender boundaries. Thereby, discriminating against them or making them come to an event in a style which is not comfortable according to them is just like making a gay guy to like a girl. It is outrageous and disgusting and discriminating. It appears like they are following the heteronormative norms for the pride events.</h1>
