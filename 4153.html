<p>there's a guy who is quite handsome and manly. He is part of our gay group. He proposed me day before yesterday and told me that he likes me and wants to be with me but I am still thinking whether I should accept his proposal or not. I've always considered him as a friend but I don't want to lose him, He's perfect but what if I am not able to fall in love with him and he gets hurt in the end.</p>
<h1>GCI- That is where the concept of DATING comes into the picture. You never start a relation with saying "I Love You". You start when you like each other. You get to know each other. You spend quality time, walk, talk, see movies, sleep(not sex), and do stupid stuff and slowly and slowly fall in love with each other. If you don't click, you can always depart in good terms.</h1>
