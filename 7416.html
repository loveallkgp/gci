<p>Hi admin. We are two guys in love with each other for 3 years but we never had sex till now. Problem is that we both live in Mumbai with joint families so have no room for sex. Also we tried to go to some hotels but they refused to give us room. One manager said this is family hotel implying that gays are not allowed(since I look effeminate). He even said he will call police if we didn't leave. Other hotels just look at me and say no vacant rooms. We tried a very low class hotel but he abused us and called us gandoo. In desperation we tried a public place but other gays in the park used to gather around and try to join. It was very shameful. At least straight couples get chance to live with each other and have sex when they feel like. But we have no options unless you are a very rich gay.</p>
<h1>GCIL- I partly agree with u that money do makes a difference.</h1>
<p>Try it in mountains or secluded beach or at a friend's place.....if u can and just one more thing.....stop feeling degraded bcoz u look effeminate.</p>
