<p>I feel disgusted, with bunch of guys are maligning our community name and ofcourse we will get such hatred from society if these idiots stoop to such activities.</p>
<p>There is one FB gay group Its about gay spots in X city
they discuss about finding a location and converting it to as a Gay Cruising Spot.
Public Toilets,Gardens and Theaters n what not.</p>
<p>Police n public se dande khaake bhi mann ni bhara jab pakde gaye the Garden mai
and even tht didnt stop them from looking fr next location.
If that was not enough they even discuss how they do it in that theater is even more cringe worthy.</p>
<h1>GCI- Listen, they won't stop even if we get our rights and all. This doesn't give out a bad message but, what matters is what you are doing for the betterment of the situation. Complaining is easy. That's what we all do. That's what media do. That's what some activists do. None of them is ready to take charge and actually do something to make the situation better. Keep the disgusting things aside and work for the betterment.</h1>
