<p>There's this guy. He goes to the classes i'm attending with me. He's tall, fair, skinny, deep black eyes that see you from with in and cute, god! he's cute;just the way i like my men. He comes in late always and is always sweaty. God! That does add a degree or two to the room temperature. I gaze at him, or rather steel one or two to maintain my straight face, We have sat together once and talked once or twice about regular studies stuff. I don't even know his name and neither does he. Now i shake hands with others as i greet them, so by logic i expect the same from him, or may be i wanna touch him and feel his thunder. . But all i receive are the same lingering gazes from him and cute little smiles as we make any eye contact, he doesn't shake hands(which he does with other guys) me, he just looks at me with those subtle alcoholic deep eyes and smiles. Sometimes just the brink of it. Honestly, this is the only thing now i look forward to in a day. Hoping for things to progress further, for god don't i want them to. Kinda silly, but just like a teenage crush, sweet! </p>
