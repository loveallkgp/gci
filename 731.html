<p>Dear admin..</p>
<p>Today i've caught by my one friend to using this i.d. He is my one of my best friend, after saw this he suddenly look at me and told me "who is this &amp; why are you using these kind of shit". so as a best friend i told him everything then he shocked and neither he gave me any reaction nor he had an appetite to talk with me and just went away. i was so shameful at that time i wanna talk with him today's evening but he makes no reaction in phone but after my some efforts he said" you're such a bastard, do you know what are you doing, idiot it's sin and why are you acting like this, gays are such a fucker persons, they ruined everything in india &amp; think about your parents what will their reaction, you better change yourself. Otherwise i'll never be your friend anymore or other in our friend-zone, grow up please," and his last words was "it's crime idiot even more than rape"
i was really shocked for his words, what gonna i do.</p>
<p>AM I WRONG???</p>
<p>$ABBY : first of all why isn't your phone locked up .. secodly if not locked why was your id open , and third thing .. is this how you handle situations ??? i mean can't you make some excuse as like ' somebody else use my phone too ' or ' i don't know what it is' .. or ' say i hacked a gay account ' :p or u can just yell at him ' y the fuck did you touch my phone ' being friend doesn't mean somebody will have right to take control on ur life . be a friend don't act like parent . and if those words were said to me by my any friend i would a given ' far better answers . u decide .u need crappy person or not</p>
