<p>Hello Everyone,
I have been following this page since a while now and I really appreciate the efforts of The Admin and also appreciate the fans who pour their heart out in front of everyone, we are ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL.</p>
<p>Well this is fairly for a need of suggestions from all the sane guys out here.
I am a 24 years old guy and I sort of always knew I am different from others but my conservative upbringing hindered me from knowing myself.
However after I went out my home town I read about things, tried to know myself better but it was this guy whom I met during my first year of College , for whom I fell , made me realise who I am.
I have always been very focused about my career that I had to give up a lot of things.
Practically I never had a relationship or never had sex with anyone.
Recently I signed up for PLANET ROMEO. But I have realised overtime that I am no that kind of guy who will go on to have sex with with a random guy.
But at the same time the biological urges are over powering me sometimes and I feel so strangled between my values and desires.</p>
<p>I dont understand what should be done.</p>
<h1>Viv- There is nothing wrong with satisfying your carnal desires. If you do go for random sex, just be non guilty. But if you think that you should wait for sometime then definitely you should wait, Its all upto you.</h1>
