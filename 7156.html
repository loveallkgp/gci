<p>Ok, so I am 23, a student of engineering at one of the top institutions in India, and a gay guy who has sexual urges every now and then.   </p>
<p>I'm bored and frustrated. I only face rejects on Grindr or Planetromeo. Probably due to my appearance? I also get the feeling that people are kind of hypocritical. Everyone's out there trying to hookup with good-looking skin, but haven't ever appraised themselves in the mirror. And thus begins the endless cycle of rejecting and getting rejected. Do you guys feel frustrated at this superficial outlook too? </p>
<p>Should I control my sexual urges and just give up on dating altogether? I'm thinking of focusing only on other skill sets and aspects including health&amp;fitness, my academics, my research, my writing and my music (instrument playing and singing skills) where I am pretty sure such frustrating moments are rarer. And even if there are frustrating moments, that could just be an indication of improvement. I could just immerse myself in the joy of working on improving myself in those aspects.</p>
<p>And then I don't even want to talk about the tedious process of trying to find a long term relationship. Isn't the following correct? The skills, knowledge and wisdom you acquire aren't gonna leave you. My work isn't going to betray me in the future. On the other hand, your lover can someday decide that he loves you less.</p>
<p>I know this is a confused mashup, but just wanted to get a clearer view on this issue from you guys. </p>
<p>Regarding my future plans, I plan to go for a PhD abroad and later join a research position in industry or academia. </p>
<h1>GCI- Stop overthinking and the get the hell out of this stupid country and there re establish ur thinking pattern because all u need is to be at a place where u can be urself. Then u will get answers to all of ur questions by itself and per se will understand that life is not meant to understand others all the time but is also about re developing ourselves whenever there is a need.</h1>
<p>P.S- Hookups can be shallow or very specific about sexual preferences and we must respect the fact that assortative mating,  a particular desire for getting laid with an impressive physique(its individualistic trust me) and having NSA must not be confused with us wanting to be with someone on a relationship basis.</p>
<p>P.P.S- Be with someone who can stick with the decision of being with you for their entire life and NOT CHOOSE to love us less than their family.
Good luck muffins!</p>
