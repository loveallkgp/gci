<p>Are there any medicines to control urges? I get 5 bonners minimum in a day. And one guy doesnot satisfy me. My bf broke up calling me a cheater but if I don't get food at home I will of course visit a restaurant. But I don't wanna cheat so how to control my urges</p>
<h1>gci: see a lot of people will curse you and question your character and call you sex addict but i want to say their is nothing wrong in you . not everybody has same sexual needs .its hormonal... and because of hormones we get sexual desire . some people have very low sexual desire and some have very high ... .</h1>
<p>people with higher sexual desire don't easily get sexually satisfied and their body always wants more . </p>
<p>and don't think that you will control hormones ....extra hormones can be given to body like sex hormones or steroids only during serious conditions  but natural hormones can't be controlled or ceased .. only with time your body needs will change and your hormonal level become normal ..so enjoy your life . stay healthy and exercise . release the extra energy . </p>
<p>about your relation if you really love him, save your relation .  if he is unable to sexually satisfy you maybe go talk to him . ofcourse he can  increase his sex timing .</p>
