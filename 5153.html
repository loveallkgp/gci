<p>Hi friends. Here I make a confession today which is not about my personal life. It has a bearing on everyone of one who stands witness to the silent tears and loneliness which have become so symbolic to our lives. Since, the time our LGBT movement have become more vocal, the right wing forces of our country have tried to resist us and to silence us by force and other means. They have always desisted from supporting our rights and many of them have gone to the extent of saying that homosexuality is a disease and must be cured!!! Being a democracy we together aspire to live a life of dignity and hope. We must demand our rights and do whatever it takes to prevent those forces from gaining power so that our rights and interests are protected. Hence, it is my earnest request to all our community members in this upcoming Delhi Election and all other future elections to not support those forces which are against our rights and existence. I would request you to even Convince your friends and family members to vote for those political parties which are supportive of GAY rights. Lets pray to GOD that future offers us hope and not despair. Thanks. </p>
