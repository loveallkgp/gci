<p>I always think to take someone within me.
But when the right time comes, I can't take it for a long... 
At First  it's like painful....Then pleasure comes...Suddenly this pleasure becomes like 'its enough. Now leave me..I can't hold this any more'</p>
<p>Why this shit happens with me.</p>
<p>Why can't I hold my man as long as he wants.... </p>
<p>Is it because of I'm not much physically fit to do that. If so then what should I do to enhance my power...</p>
<p>One more question _
*is it good to go for anal on daily basis.?</p>
<h1>I'm new into this anal pleasure.</h1>
<h1>GCI- As u r new to it..let me give u guide book tips-</h1>
<p>1- U don't need to have sex for the sake of having sex.
2- As ur ass is new to this experience, ur feelings and sensations are absolutely normal.
3- Ass pounding must be done gently and there should be pleasure and no extreme pain. In ur case ur pain quotient will decrease slowly.
4- No, its NOT ok to go for anals daily or regularly with any foreign body too. There must be a certain gap period of some days depending on the strength and capacity of ur ass.
5- U r not obligated to enjoy for as long as he wants or as long as u want...bcoz everyone's sexual quota is different...Make sure u both get to know each other sexually in terms of ur timings.
6- Ur ass must not bleed at any cost and never allow to penetrate if u have eaten heavy food or if ur passage is blocked by any internal metabolic mechanism.
7- Go for Kegel exercises and do a bit of exercises, including hamstrings and exercises of lower body part.</p>
<p>Goodluck and no pounding without a condom.</p>
