<p>pls post this
Its very difficult if you cant express yourself with people around you, As you know you will be judged for who you are. I've thought of coming out but really its too hard, and I don't know if I'll be able to handle that. It sucks that you have no one to talk to or share your feelings with someone. One day finally, I tried to come out to my mom but she didn't understand, I tried to explain her but she felt sadden and depressed. I love her so much, she has faced so many things in her life and I don't want her to worry about my sexuality when there are so many things in her plates right now. So, I told her please don't worry about me I'll be okay and we never discussed about it again. I'm a working person but I feel so lonely every time. Feels jealous of people around me, when they can talk freely about their love life. Sometimes I feel like running out of this country but it is also not that easy( Actually I'm trying to find a way, help me out pls) .My job sucks, I wanted to work in a environment where people respect you. I've joined this group but here most people are sex seekers.</p>
