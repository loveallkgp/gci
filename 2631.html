<p>hi admin well I ain't gay..
m a straight guy.
in my school days dre a guy in our class he was a gay..
e everybody mad fun of him..everybody.
even i was one of them who use. to mock him..
as days passed by we passed out from school ..
and a few days back i met his father i went upto him said</p>
<p>"hello uncle how are you?"</p>
<p>uncle- "i am fine how are you.."</p>
<h2>me - "i am great and ganna complete my final year! btw how is Jai" (jai aint his real name)</h2>
<p>uncle didnt spoke a word.. his eyes were getting wet and as soon as I kept my hand on his shoulder he bursted out in. tears !
you have no idea how it feels when you see a old man crying in front of Ya u feel so helpless :/</p>
<p>I asked him. again uncle is everything all right
.
uncle said - " Jai got selected in India's top engineering college ! and left for Delhi! we all thought he was gaining knowledge there and we all Wer very proud of him.. but last year he commited suicide .. they said that he was teased and mocked they bullied him and ragged him .. "</p>
<p>uncle wanted to talk more but his tears wouldn't let him.. I dropped him home that day..
.
somewhr or the other I feel that even I am one of the reasons for what ever happened with Jai.
.
hey buddy I am sorry.. and trust me those who did that with you are in jail.
ho sake Tou Maaf kar Dena.</p>
<h1>GCI- Holy CHILLS! See what bullying can do! A sheer waste of pure talent and an innocent human life! Its sick!</h1>
