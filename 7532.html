<p>Hey ! This post is for my crush ARAYAN THAKUR (Fake id name), from BHOPAL. Dude i'm drunk and celebrating my birthday. I dont know why suddenly you came in my mind. Last year when I saw you in hospital first time, i was completely lost in your eyes. Everyday i used to come to see students and i always have increased heart beats when you passes near by me. But once you rudely talked to your intern looking at me. I felt bad like you are showing my anger on her. Then i started ignoring you. Once you came and sat near me. I was like what? Now why are you sitting next to me? Im missing you today coz tequilla has made me lost my mind. I was watching your fingers of hands and was scared to look at your face.Coz i dont wish to see ur beautiful eyes and cute nose again. After 10 minute when you stood up i felt bad. After 1 week i again came to supervise my student that was my last day in college.I resigned. After a month back i had chat with a guy and saw his pic and IT WAS YOU.  Seriously i felt happy and got angry at the same time that i used to come to see you in hospital and after resigning i came to know that you are bisexual. Punch karne ka mann kar raha tha tujhe.I wasnt going to reveal your identity. I just wished to have a quality of time with you. You have deactivated ur fake id and made with another name. Im searching you today also. I miss your beautiful eyes and cute nose. You know me who I am. This is my bday wish to share my feelings to you. Please come.</p>
