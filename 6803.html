<p>After so many months of speculation and anxiety, they finally decided the name of the person who would be replacing my manager after he heads for another responsibility. It was me. The last night conference call meeting was one of the most epic and most memorable ones in my life. I am just going give you a small glimpse of how it went.
My Superior:-Do you think you would be able to handle it, provided that you do not have not so good interpersonal connections with your team mates nor a lot of experience.
Me:- I think that you can judge from the work that I have managed so far as a Team Lead, even after having 'not so good interpersonal connections with my team mates'.
Our Client:- I agree with him totally, I have seen how he works and his ability to understand the minute details, even extending his shifts for many hours at a stretch, when there is an outage. I believe we do not have any more time to keep searching, if it is to be done then it has to be done now, well before in advance, and I do not see anyone better suited for this position.
My Superior: Yes, I fully agree with you. I do believe he has a thing for being farsighted. Lets close it then.
My Manager:Sure, go ahead.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, I had tears in my eyes. 
Moral of the story:- At times hard work triumphs prejudices as well.</p>
<p>As the new manager managing 70 employees, I will make sure that my company's non discrimination policy is also upheld in its true spirit besides many other good things. 
It might not be big thing, but as a transgender(closeted though), it is a big achievement for me, and I am sure there are many more still to come. Just wanted to share this with you all because wanted to tell you that miracles don't happen on their own, we have to make them happen. We need to be the change we want to see in this world. Self pity is a quality of the cowards, as a transgender we have a woman's mind and a woman's resoluteness, just show the world what you have got.    </p>
<h1>GCI- That's amazingly put. Congratulations for your promotion! Hope the rest of your dreams come true as well.</h1>
