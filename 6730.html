<p>oh man.. i am writing this out of sheer excitement which i couldnt control now. I even thought to come out of the class, but i couldnt control my nervousness and excitement, my god, my god, didnt know where to share, so doing it here, dears ! 
Ypou SHOULD see him to believe men lik him exist ! see you have a crush ( among countless others ) in your Ug, and all changed, no contact after college, and after 3 years, in another country, in a completely different situation, you see some one who is the RELICA of your crush with the replica voice, replica smile, replica hair style, etc. what will be your reaction ? i just couldnt blieve my own eyes. He is sitting just right next to me. Please all of you come here and explain all this to him patiently and make him get married to me this evening ! I dont even want to touch him, just looking at him is fine ! But unfortunately he comes from Syria And belongs to "that" religion. One cannot be a gay and "that" religious at the same time :/ Help me. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, calm your butterflies down, princess. I know how it feels. I have the look alike of my ex over here and I see him here walking with other people. Damn I cannot catch a break anyway.</h1>
<p>PS- Don't get your knickers in a twist.</p>
