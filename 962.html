<p>Em 18..;)
Well first of all.. Viv Dude.. u r doing super job..;)
n now.. ma confession-cum-dilemma..
Its that ki.. em not here for realtionships.. coz i have experienced both.. Long distance and same city one's and at the end em hurt..
But the thing is.. I like to chat.. chat a lot.. making new friends. .. People flirt with me.. they r mesmerised wid my replies. the way i talk.. Mostly get attached to me.. Sometimes if I too find the guy intersting . I flirt with him..and that I feel is kinda normal.. A healthy friendship..could accomodate such things.. I always say to them in the starting that em here only for friendship n fun.. But.. at then .. They end up in proposing me.. (90%).. i like them as friends.. but.. At the same time.. it makes me feel guilty.. I can't accept all..or I can't love like this. They say so bad to me.. tht i break hearts.. no feelings tears n all drama.. I hate this stuff.. and they end up in breaking friendships wid me.. Nobody cares what I think..What I feel.. If i say a no.. its jus for my sake .. coz i enjoy being friends.. I know my limitations.. I never say a guy that u r bad.. i always say that em not good for yuh.. I always take blame on me.. tryin to make them comfo. but nobody eva thinks bout this Guy!..:( :(. then after sometime..I walk away from their life.. so that they could move on.. then also its a problem.. Huh.. what shoul I do..? :(</p>
<h1>Viv- Oh man. I do the same too. Like saying at the beginning that I don't want relationship. Some take it healthy, other leave. But its not your fault. Many guys here don't understand that two gay guys can be awesome friends. But you know, the flirting is what leads them on. Try toning it down a bit. Not too much but somewhat less and see if you have the same situation.</h1>
