<p>hiii
 i was in bus stand today waiting for bus today suddenly a boy came and sat by me  and so abruptly he asked can i touch ur dick i said no.  he said please i said please go away as i dont believe in random sex. he forcefully touched it i shouted hey you just get lost . that guy was so shameless ugly crap he didnt even walked out instead he start following me which i found very strange  and then  he literally came on my face and started starring at me which was so lame  and macabre. i feel so bad that these pervert people are responsible for making community bad because of these people our community suffer . i found it literally an assault and its so damn cheap.  where we have some fantastic people in our community on the other side we have such a bastards pervert who let us down!</p>
<h1>GCI- Yeah ryt..even i have faced the same..but its upto us to maintain our dignity and perverts are everywhere in every skin, colour, sexuality etc etc .</h1>
<p>Next tym tell him..KYA BHAU KAYE KO MERE PICHE PICHE ATA....M TEREKO MERA POPAT KA AWAZ NHI SUNAYEGA!
JAA NA RE BABA..JASTI DIMAG KHOTEE NA KAR !</p>
