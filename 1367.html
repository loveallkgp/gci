<p>a girl's confession.</p>
<p>i was actually a very sensitive girl and i had a boyfriend. he came to this city to study in a college and he was staying in a appartment. he lived near to my house and few events made us meet and we fell in love with each other and he proposed. after few months, i was very much worried about him. he didn't respond to my calls for 3 days. so as he lived alone, i decided to cook food for him and go to his home. i prepared spinach-cottage cheese stew and few chappaties. when i went there, i found that door was unlocked and so i entered without any indication and i opened room and what i saw was made me feel drowsy. he was with a guy . he looked at me and he was shocked and i started crying but just after a moment i got angry. everything which was in front of my eyes, i threw at him- tables, chairs,books,bag etc. he was naked and so was his partner and he begged for apology. he knelt before me and said that he was sorry and he is stupid but i kept on throwing things at him and his naked friend started wearing his clothes. i was so heart broken and shouted on top of my lungs- why?! why did you do that? i just couldn't control my anger and snatched his hair and slapped him 100 tines and how i lefr that place? i don't remember too. it took me 3 months to overcome that depression, sometimes i wished to call him and forgivebhim but i knew this won't stop him from being what he is.
so i became lonely and depressed.
so my message to everyone is that even if you are a gay , it doesn't matter but please don't date a girl , once your secrets will be revealed, it will hurt that girl and the guy too who loves you. your bisexual intrest can break 2 hearts</p>
<h1>Viv- Hiding from the society and trying to make yourself believe something which you are really not, will get you in a situation like this. No one has the right to play with anyone's heart. And girl, I feel you. Just be strong and move on. You have a lot of strength in you. I mean who could throw a table? Just keep your calm and surely you will get the one you deserve who will love only you.</h1>
