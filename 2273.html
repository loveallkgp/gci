<p>I am a gay !
And I don't like bisexuals. I know I know..you'd be telling me that I should not do this because its wrong and all. But here is the thing- we gays don't like bi's 'coz we are insecure with them. We don't know how to trust 'em. He likes both men and women and men are naturally more inclined to women ( due to the society pressure thing as well ) So, who know after relationship of a few weeks they might just be with some other girl? And ain't that bad for us. Plus its even hard to find gays. what are we supposed to do? They will marry and spend a happy life and we will be left heartbroken. Alll this seems so wrong. And we are little jealous of them as well :P Why would they have it both ways. No I wont let anybody just take advantage of me and then 'move on'. I'd prefer a gay guy for me. At least I will not be as insecure...I know gays are famous for cheating alot...but still there is less insecurity than being with a bi guy.
I know this mindset of mine not good somewhere and I need to broaden my thinking about this as all Bisexuals are not that way. But for now, if I speak honestly, I think this way and changing this will require a little more time I guess..maybe my whole lifetime..who know? ;)
so m really sorry Bisexuals there...but i just cant help it !</p>
