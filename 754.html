<p>my age is 21 and i have been following this page for a while n before deleting my fake fb id i want to say it through this page...all the guys who somewhat can't express their feelings n emotions ...often tend to come here n make a fake id.... n then all they need is some attention from the guys here n i was one of them ... i did everything ..sharing nude pics ... n even tried flirting with real life friends ...hangouts n everything that would give me some fun.... but ultimately it leads to depression ...at some point of life u regret for doing all this..... being gay doesn't always mean having sex with a guy....t/b ....wanna meet .... thats all temporary satisfaction .... never thought that i would fall for someone not because how he looks but instead its his behavior that makes me love him....love or attraction ... but when i look at him, i smile...i like to b around him... may b i might never get his love for me.... but atleast i can give a try...but before that i want to change myself ..... may b there r lots of grammatical n spelling errors.... but i guess real heart won't look at the errors but the emotions behind the words...thankyou admins of this page...God bless </p>
<h1>Viv- No matter how many hook ups we have or how many guys we date, we always reach a saturation point where we just wanna get settled with a person of our dreams to share coffee on the balcony, to tease each other, to have little fights and then making up to each other. That's when your maturity kicks in and my dear friend, you are reaching that stage. Be careful to not hurt yourself in the process you are about to go through.</h1>
