<p>Dear Admin,
This is a tribute to BOBBY from my side hope you will allow me to pay this tribute. Before going further would like to share this note that BOBBY wrote on his 16th Birthday in the spring of 1979</p>
<p>I can't ever let anyone find out that I'm not straight. It would be so humiliating. My friends would hate me. They might even want to beat me up. And my family? I've overheard them. They've said they hate gays, and even God hates gays, too. Gays are bad, and God sends bad boys to hell. It really scares me when they are talking about me."</p>
<p>Unable to handle the unresolved daily struggles and conflict with both his family and his religion, Bobby jumped off a bridge onto a busy highway in front of a large tractor trailer in Portland, Oregon on August 27, 1983 and was killed instantly due to massive internal injuries. His detailed personal diaries are filled with diatribes of self-hate because he believed that as a homosexual he was a worthless human being and innately evil because he was a tool of the Devil.</p>
<p>I am very much emotional after watching the movie "PRAYERS FOR BOBBY" &amp; even i am in closet as i have still not disclosed  to my parents that i am gay.</p>
<p>Bobby was very alone because in spite of having families there was no one who could understand the emotions through which BOBBY was going through.</p>
<p>It is not our choice that we are gay, God has sent us like this  &amp; this need to be excepted by our parents. I dont know how many of you feel this right. 
But from my side I take this pledge that i will not let myself die the death of BOBBY. I will keep alive the spirit of BOBBY in my heart and i will try end possible ways to come up to my parents.
Because the god has sent us like this hence....
Dear God,
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN
I NEED YOU TO ANSWER...
We love you BOBBY...
You are always in our heart alive.....</p>
<p>Request you all to watch the movie Prayers For Bobby</p>
<h1>GCI- Whether it was BOBBY, JAMIE OR LEELA OR MATHEW ..they didn't deserve to die....U know y???  BCOZ THEY WERE FUCKING NOT GUILTY OF BEING GAY OR TRANS!!! they were harmless humans and very nice souls...which most of us could never fathom....Every fucking time I see them i am filled with anger, gloom, irritation but i don't lose hope...Bcoz i learned this from them..EVEN IF U DIE IN THE WRONG MANNER U LIGHT THE PATH FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW AND CREATE NEW MILESTONES!!</h1>
