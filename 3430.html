<p>I dont knw how to start this bt PLZ guys read thins n let me have ur suggesstions....</p>
<p>We guys r togethr since 3-4 months and i love him like hell ! I am posting this confession nw 9:45am d moment i wake he is oly one i think of since the morning till the nights and even mere sapne me bhi aata hai ye kuuta.. :(
i had a relationship before 5 yrs and now after 5 yrs he is the only guy i fall for.. I knw am nevr gonna have him because he doesnt loves me he just have the frnds wala thing we talk late nights, hours on calls, msging n all evryday bt for him its just his frndhsip and nothing else ! I doonoo weather he too will feel the same for me or not bt all now i knw is that i cant get over him, he too somewhere knw this dat i have got strong feelings for him bt he is just not ready to take a step ahead and believe me.. Bt dats ok i nevr expected anything from him and i dont evn expect that one day hee will love me back because my love is true from my heart... Am just not in luv with his body bt i love his soul main kabhi usse apne se alag soch hi nahi paya its like he is now a part of me.. Mai usse ye baat nhi keh pata ki mai usse beintehaa pyar karta hun bt vo already ye baat jaanta hai.... I feel 'bad' for this that he doesnt believe me n my love for him bt trust me it nevr 'hurts' me.. My love fo him is unconditional i always think of him at 1st place dan my ownself. Mere liye uski khushi, uski success hi sab kuch hai i know vo kahin na kahin thoda pareshan rehta hai bt all i want in my life is to see him happy i'll go through evry minute thing just to make him happy no matter how it feels to me.. Mujhe nhi pta ye pyar mujhe kaha le jayega bt mai itna zaroor jaanta hun ki ye banda meri lyf ka last banda hoga jisse maine kabhi itna pyar kiya... I dont undrstand how other people fall in love EXPECTING the same from them too bt trust me i nevr evr thought of this that he too should love me back ... I just wanna give my all to him without gettting anything in return.. I wont even mind if he cut all the communication what all i have to do is loving him loving him n loving him ... I knw tujhe life me kabhi kisi ka pyar ni mila bt haan tu hamesha mujhe yaad rakhega for loving u even beyond to the extreme limits of love....
I truely unconditionally crazily effingly madly deeply emotionally mentally will be loving u forever no matter what i get from u am living for u n i'll die for u......</p>
