<p>I m from Chennai .. Joined   an mnc 2 yes ago..same routine life.Sometimes i feel very odd when watching how world is nd how I am. Do i defer or i keep dreaming whole life yet not awake..? I feel so separate from ppl around me.not colleagues not frnds nd not even my family.its like seeing a child's play.like u always no the climax.thn  I thot I wud a get a guy like me  to share my heart.. Stepped into fb grindr n al. Wherever I see, its oly flesh n lust they seek .. Even Those who txtd matured enuf after sharing pics , wud like to gt laid if felt I luk better than them ,or show attitude n ignore if they luk better than me. Either way not my choice.im manly n i prefer a  manly guy. One even called me 'bhai' after chatting full 2days cus he wants top .not an equal mind person ..rofl...they wudn no I'm such desperate to settle on them..  . i wonder where is the other such person in this Chennai  dominion .? is he thinking the same rite now as me..? wondering wen ll he get a man like himself?. If so pls maintain such same  patience for the snow dragon is still waiting for u here.. Not believing  al dragons were extinct  just searching similar character al its life...  enlighten me master admin.. Throw some lite on me.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmm...maybe u should wait for ur fire dragon and its not necessary he should come from the east.</h1>
<p>Lemme put it sanely and clearly as I can-</p>
<p>1- LGBT in our country is still finding their niche as people and individuals and this is the era of chaos and pandemonium.</p>
<p>2- U must understand that people of our community have copied blindly from the west ruining their own identity in search of identities.</p>
<p>3- Here 90% are pure rubbish in terms of relationships, friendship or any other thing that u want on a long term basis.</p>
<p>4- DO NOT mix sand with salt...u would get nothing...i.e the kind of guy u want is the salt and the society is the sand....its that a task to get ur guy in this present times.</p>
<p>5- There is nothing wrong in intimacy, because isn't it what u want??? The problem here is that we have build walls of pre conceived notions that how our guy 'must be' instead of how he 'will be' in reality.</p>
<p>6- Clear out ur mind on the fact that whether u can handle reality or want everything to be moulded according to ur whims and wishes!</p>
<p>7- STOP looking out for unknown attachment, happiness and satisfaction in ur dream man.....life is hard and harsh and it always gives us task to find, sustain and live with one.....do not forget this....</p>
<p>8- Keep ur sanity intact and work on urself everyday, be the kind of person u want to meet, stay and love. And when u meet some one someday the real herculean task will start when u r on the zenith point of being done with him.</p>
<p>CIAO.</p>
