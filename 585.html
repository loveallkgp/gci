<p>Hope to get help from u guys,My 2nd confession here.</p>
<h1>19 Male Bottom.</h1>
<p>I hav been in a complicated relationship with a guy since 2yrs.
In the begining it was a long distance relation and we just chatted on phone and fb.
I met him for the first time 2 months ago,even went to his home,got in his bed with him,but didn't<br>
had any kind of feel of love or affection even he observed it.but now he forces me to be his love.
The poblem is.there is another guy whom i know from past 8 months.i met him after reading his confession on this page,he is the best person i've ever met,we met quite alot but like friends.i dont know when i fell in love with him,and i told him everything and he replied that he could love anyone in the world but not me becoz it would ruin r friendship.
Everyday i feel like hell,firstly for being rejected and then betraying a person whom i've known for 2yrs.i curse myself for getting in such a horrible situation.
Please help me i can't live with this burden.
and Admin u r a great person,god bless u.</p>
<p>$ABBY : first of all ... chill .. u haven't done anything wrong . as human we tend to get tilted or carried away in emotions . the guy you know from 2 years .. if u don't have any feelings for him .. just go to him and tell him that and part your way . the second guy whom you love ... either stay friends with him or if u can't then do move away from him too and fresh start ur life . don't make things complicated .</p>
