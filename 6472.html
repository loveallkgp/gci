bt after few months we became very close friends rather best friends that we started going for long drives, shopping, had dinner together most of time we spend together although he was nt from my department he used to help me in every possible way..
eventually i get addicted and fall in love with him, i started calling him, i gave all my priority to him, he also gave me his importance and help me in every possible way bt after few months his behaviour changes dramatically he started ignoring my call whenever i call him, we started fighting nd so on
bt every time he did something i forgave him,
After 1 yr
oneday i had my dinner nd went to meet him , he was obviously playing EA sports football (some game in laptop) i started talking to him he ignored me i get so angry nd i asked him for 10 rs for cigarets he gave me
i left his room nd come to my room in between road he cought me with my roommate he gave all his priority to roommate not me i get Jealous, he make fun of me i throw his money on face nd left from der..</p>

while sleeping i hold his hand and hugged him though that was nt for the first time i hugged him bt this time it feels lil different intensity of breathing increases nd hugged him more tightly later on he put his hands inside my shirt which makes me turn on i kissed him on his cheeks
he also responding me equally he was shirtless nd hottest man for me
i have ever seen, he was also hard that time i sucked him nd he fucked me with all his love, next morning i woke up nd left his room while going i kissed him on his forehead</p>
<p>that whole day he dint call me never came to meet me, i was worried nd i know that was mistake we get intimate with each other,
from that day things had change he never called me again after that incident he was straight, i made him to have sex with me... i was guilty i regretted i confessed my feelings to him, bt he never responded i cried, cried a lot
