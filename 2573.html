<p>I have always wondered about shemales? Are eunuchs half male half female anatomically? Can they get pregnant? Who do they have sex with Males females or other shemales? And why do they Clap and scare others? Do they have divine powers?</p>
<h1>GCI- Shemales- Hermaphrodites. They are gender neutral. They can't reproduce.</h1>
<p>Eunuchs- Castrated males. They can't reproduce.</p>
<p>Depending upon the condition of our country, both shemales and eunuchs are forced to beg for living and many opt for prostitution. But due to the latest Supreme Court judgment, they have been given equal status as they come under the term of transgender. </p>
<p>A bit more info about them. HIjras, eunuch or khwaja sira were respected in the old mughal and indian kingdoms. They were confidants of the royal courts and many times they were the royal dancers. Their clap is a form of prayer to Bahuchara Mata. They have a strong history in our culture which has been overlooked. Its not really scary if they clap. :)</p>
