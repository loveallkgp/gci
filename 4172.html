<p>I've always known I was gay. Lately, accepted it as well. Have no interests in girls, romantically and sexually. I even watch gay porns. Well, I didn't want to go so personal but lemme give little more details. Even when i masturbate I always think of boys.
Few days ago, while surfing through porns, accidentally i saw a picture of vagina....clicked on it and watched a guy and gal do the stuff. The vagina sorta interested me. I was just watching it. I didn't feel like being in the pace of the guy in the movie but somehow i wanted to see the structure of the new thing I was witnessing on the screen...it was a new thing...a new mechanism u was looking at. But frankly I was more interested in the dick that was going inside n out.
so...all I want to know your opinion on this - could i b bisexual? :/
P.S. I don't wannabe bisexual! (par hamare chahne se kab kya huwa hai :( ) <em>sigh</em> just tell me what u guys think. Thank you.</p>
<h1>GCI- The very picture of v-jayjay irritates me. Honey, everyone knows deep within what they are. If you want to be sure, just picture yourself putting your pee-pee in lady parts. If you cringe, you are gay which I am pretty sure you would.</h1>
