<p>Hey!
So here is what I have to say..I AM GAY. I know this may sound cliched or downright idiotic but bear with me. Those who have said these 3 magical words  will understand the enoromous amount of effort that goes into saying this words out loud..err.. write this outloud? 
Anyways like many of the confessors, I have long waited for a way to let out the secrets that I have kept buried in the depths of my soul. Well.. I knew that I was gay since may be when I hit puberty. And to those who have still managed to block out the nonsense that i have written till now I would just like to say that life is not as difficult as we it may seem. See it took me a long time to come to terms with who I am. Mistakes were made, hearts were broken but ultimately I found my way. I came out to my elder brother a few months ago and it wasn't at all as I had expected it to be for I was swinging between the extremes. I had thought either he would accept me with arms streched ready for a hug or he'll downright reject me n out me to my parents n make my life a living hell. Fyi i belong to a somewhat orthodox Brahmin family and doing things that are not meant to be done doesn't go down well with my family. Neither of the two happened. Instead he sat me down n asked me if i was completely sure. I was like ya.. I am. Then came the awkward part when he asked me if i have had any sexual encounters. There I was sitting like a naked guy exposed to the world. Honestly i dont remember most of what happened after that. There was no hugging or shedding of tears. It was the middle of the night n we had to sleep. I asked him if he was ok with it? He got worried and gave me a hell lot of gyan about condoms n stuff n your usual how to avoid reckless sex.  I wasn't prepared for that. Finally what he said and what has been my single most greatest source of joy since then is that he told me that i would always be his brother. But he advised me against coming out to my parents. </p>
<p>The reason for sharing my story is to make may be some of u understand that it doesn't always end badly. It may have sounded like a dreamy ride but trust me, I have dealt with my inner demons. There were suicide attempts n periods of depression n nights of sleeplessness that are just unforgetable and stuff of nightmares. I lost years of my life and career to this. I even lost my faith.</p>
<p>I just want to tell you that don't lose hope. May be the entire world will reject you. May be they will never accept who you are. May be the ones you love will turn their backs on you. But remember the courage you gain by fighting your demons and darkness and emerging with the scars and experiences will be lessons that will help you bear the wrath of the tyrants of society and make you stand so damn firmly against the tests of time. You are not alone. </p>
<p>P.S I got into a medical college. So plzzzzzs</p>
<p>Oh and hats off to the efforts of of the single father with twin surrogate daughters. People like you make believe in myself. I hope you get through these tough times. </p>
<h1>GCI- Now this is what i call a COMING OUT SPEECH of the future!</h1>
<p>G-POWER TO U HONEY!</p>
