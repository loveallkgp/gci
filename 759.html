<p>How to combat my social anxiety disorder?
I am a small town gay! In fact, i have always felt like a girl, so i should say- I am a transgender.
I am 19.
I was in this small town (my hometown) when i appeared for this National Level Exam and got selected for this national institute for my graduation. I was very excited initially but later i found that i am not as much aware about the life and world of the big cities (or i should say cities) as my classmates from such cities know.
Technology, Gadgets and Gizmos, different brands of mobiles, smartphones, clothes etc., Fashion and Grooming Skills, Fluency in English , Affluent clothes, Non-Bollywood Music, Non-Bollywood Foreign Movies- All these were (ARE) not my cup of tea because being a small town guy i never came across such things.
And the fact of being effeminate also killed me inside only.
NOW, i have become extremely self-centered because i have lost all my self-esteem. I think i am out of place among these macho guys from big cities who talk about foreign films and music, cars and smartphones and have rich hobbies.
Since i am a girl by heart, even i have not had any interest in gadgets or in cars or smartphones etc.
So, i find myself so out of place!
It has caused inferiority complex and superiority complex (YES BOTH, for these people i have I.C. and for some, S.C. have developed over the time). I have lost all my confidence.</p>
<p>I try but fail to combat my social anxiety disorder arisen from this.
VIV and friends, help me!</p>
<h1>Viv- You say you are from small town? You still have such good writing skills! I mean many guys from rich cities can't even type straight or have good english. You excel in both! That's one positive point about you. As far as hobbies or interests are concerned, you may have your hobbies as every person has his/her own. You don't have to be a bhed or bakri to like what others like. BTW, its not at all late to widen your horizons. Second positive point about you is your sexuality. Never let your sexuality be a reason to feel ashamed. There are other transgender people like you in this world, country and hell, in your very city. One thing that you can do is contact an NGO and let them help you. Or if you could be its part, you may really feel comfortable after some positive validity and by helping others.</h1>
