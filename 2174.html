<p>so there it goes. .</p>
<p>I'm a bit introvert with strangers and a bit girly when I'm overexcited ! :|</p>
<p>its a story about me and my friend X and a classmate !</p>
<p>I usually make fun of my friend in front of other friends.. just casual jokes and all ! and I also become the laughing topic sometimes in the group. .
I didn't know that would hurt my friend X so much ! </p>
<p>what happend on Thursday was..</p>
<p>I was in class and all of my friends left except for friend X ...</p>
<p>I was sitting with Friend X and we started talking to a group of girls (we hate that group but my friend was interested in talking to them)</p>
<p>and I was talking to them normally. . but my friend started insulting them gradually. . they are so full of attitude. . they couldn't take the insult. . my friend was like " you should tie up your hair, and you shouldn't pout everytime. . you are so ugly n all" .... I call a girl of that group DUCKFACE.. I kept that name of her because initially I didn't know her name and secondly she pouts everytime ! </p>
<p>my friend told them  that I call her duck face !! </p>
<p>and then that DUCKFACE just got on me.. she started insulting me. . she took all her anger, insult out on me.. she didn't say even a single word to my friend.<br>
she kept her calm and in a friendly way kept on insulting me.. and my friend was with them laughing on their cheap jokes.. they all were insulting me.. my friend was giving hi5 to them.. I was totally fucked up..</p>
<p>that girl while insulting me said " tu badsurat hai.. because tune mera naam DUCKFACE rakha toh ab hisaab barabar... kehti agar tu mekko naa batata toh mekko toh lagta ki tu janani hai.. tu toh item hai.. tera ladkiyo wala figure hai.. you have a face that resemble to eagle " and my friend was laughing with them just because I made fun of him in the group of guys.. but he forgot that even was made the topic of jokes in the same group.. I'm a friend of him and I was all alone when that bitch was insulting me.. he was so evil at that time.. </p>
<p>I somehow gulped that insult and managed to leave that conversation. . I was so upset for the entire day  </p>
<p>then today I talked to some other people they were so warm welcoming and then when I left they were making fun of me !!</p>
<p>I mean everything just screws me up.. I don't understand the double standard of people..</p>
<p>I went to talk to those people because my friend X was not giving any attention to me and other friends were supporting him..</p>
<p>I think I should get back to the introvert track and get myself alone ! </p>
<p>I need someone to understand what is in my heart</p>
<h1>GCI : oh these school kids ..... see either don't do any mocking or insulting if you can't take it back.karma fucks back .</h1>
<p>let me tell you golden rule if you want power over people . never say anything bad to anybody on face or behind their back or mack about their looks or about their physique.... nobody ... i say nobody will ever have guts to say a single thing about you on your face .. because they will know that you have higher class and has morals. 
only time people get power over you is when you have bitched about them . </p>
<p>and one more thing 'The insider who knows all the secrets can bring down Lanka '.... so don't say or tell anything to anybody which they can use against you in future when you are not friends . </p>
<p>thirdly its just school life darling ... when you will go to college their will be a worst world you will get to know... so just chill and prepare for the best ..stay away from bitching .</p>
