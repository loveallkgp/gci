<p>HI GUYs
I am in weird situation.I am a gay and i hv a strong crush on a guy in my office.Whenever i see him, my eyes get glued to him.I have tried sometimes to see his tool too in common washroom on our floor while pissing.Today i come to know, he is aware abt all these things and he was sharing all these things with colleagues in his team. They all started laughing on me after knowing all this.
i have not done anything wrong to him,except i stare at him when i get a chance to see him.
I am in mid 30's and single ,ppl already suspect my being single at such age.
I dont know, what should i do in this situation.Please help i dont wont ppl around in my office to disrespect me for all this.Please give ur kind suggestions.Thnx</p>
<h1>GCI- First know that if there are anti-discriminatory law in your company or not and do they observe the rules of safe space? If they don't have it all then please don't do anyting that can harm your job. If they do, then tell everyone to mind their own business. And please quit staring. It is really creepy.</h1>
