<p>Hello everyone ....after reading the stories of all Indian gay coupes again I was actually provoked to write about a story of two people in love in the 40's in India.
It dates back to the time of the world war when Indian soldiers were used as ally army by the British in the second world war....At that time two men were engaged in a love affair followed by passionate love making sessions which couldn't go unnoticed by a fellow army mate.. The posting was somewhere near Burma and whether they were to be with the army on the front in the war or not..but here they were.... doing bit of their duty of loyalty towards the BRITISH CROWN..
It was evening..the sun had set and had allowed the darkness to play its toll on the environment....the whistling of the army camps could be heard distinctly..One army guy was on for a patrol in the evening..suddenly a moaning sound was heard from behind the bushes not far from the cooking arena....but it sounded much familiar...and when he went there to see who it was ..the guy was utterly shocked..There two of his comrades were having a love making session and were shocked and scared to see him..the guy was appalled at what he saw at first but when he saw them on their knees begging for him to keep silent his heart melted ...and after sometime he questioned his comrade..''Why do u do this, being physical with the Cook''??
His mate replied..I don't feel anything sexual for my wife and i love this guy..and he loves me too..we cannot be with each other just because the society thinks its wrong..and the law is also not on our side....(this was the era when homosexuality had already been stated as a crime in 1861..and ostracism was the main concern)..I cannot even think to fuck my wife because the very thought of it makes me feel sick..He had no kids and would always be outside on the army camps etc..and rarely used to go back home....The guy who kept his secret was really surprised to know about this clandestine affair at first but gradually came to terms with it and accepted it as a secret part of his life....later on after many years he narrated this passionate love story about guys hooking up with each other at the army base camps in the middle of the forests and near the river bed....to his grand daughter....and that grand daughter is my classmate ..and to your surprise his brother is gay too and she was searching a bf for his brother....and his brother is going to US to work after his Ph.d.</p>
<p>And we say that Indian parents, family and traditions are deaf and homophobic..its not their fault guys..they were brought up that way..they also need time to grasp and accept so called NEW things..atleast try to make them understand and have some real COURAGE for saying the truth...and the way my classmate was brought up ..we certainly can learn something from her and her grandpa if not openness....REMEMBER! HATE AND IGNORANCE HAS CREATED MANY PROBLEMS IN THE PAST AND HAS SOLVED NONE....which side do u wanna stand???</p>
<p>With love...Raajiv</p>
