<p>Hi...gci...its a nice platform to say smthing to a broad range....although i believe gayism is related to our birth nd childhood....
But guys there is one more thing which i think is more contributing to increase gayism...thats INTERNET...ND EDUCATION...in past ppl live in village...they even dnt knw what is gayism...i dnt think that they had any type of craving for gay marriage...in present time also villages r least affected by gayism....
Nw in cities too many gays...i think reason is internet nd education...internet is making ppl more erotic...present time education is making ppl more sofisticated...nd in cities there r lot of ppl who r handsome stylish...so that may also become factor...nd i think in cities emptiness nd lonliness is also although there r too many ppl...but ppl still feel lonly...so these may be factors for gay revolution in cities town...this is my view...may be incorrect...</p>
<h1>GCI- Put it this way, when internet didn't exist, the mindset of people only saw a defined way of relations i.e. a heterosexual relation. But still homosexuals did exist. If you look at the history of homosexuality, the homosexuals group in the late 1800s, were already colonizing in the big cities and that happened when there was no internet. Still at that time men did sex with men. Again, it totally depends upon the people that how they want to treat themselves with their sexuality.</h1>
