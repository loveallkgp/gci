<p>After years of daily to monthly flings, i met a guy a couple of years ago. Dark, slim and an awesome persona! Immediate casual fling.. A couple of days later i heard him sing.. I was completely put under and fell for him.. Suddenly,  guys who I'd usually think are seriously hot, seemed like Draco Malfoy (very cute, but just don't feel the need to be looking at him again)... We became very good friends... Meeting him and attending is calls became the highlights of my calender.. As a friend, he was a Catch. Yesterday was his wedding...   Here's to the biggest love of my love (thus far) and his beautiful and sweet wife!! May both of you have a wonderful life together!! As for me, i hope all those cute guys become hot again very soon!! 
PS- Cheers to the admins...Reading your comments were the 2nd biggest highlight of my calender!! Lol! </p>
