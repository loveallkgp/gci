<p>It was freshers party 2013. A very handsome hunk, probably the hottest fresher of our college was given a task to perform 20 pushups. The hot hunk performed 100. I still remember his white shirt drench in sweat, sticking to his hot body, 8packs visible. </p>
<p>This was love at first site. We gradually started interacting and we became bestest of friends. I am a bisexual and he is straight. But he dint kno about my second half. We used to hug, sleep together sometimes, party together, share secrets etc. 
Aftr 2 years of friendship, we were like soulmates.
Then came the biggest mistake of my life. I confessed about myself amd he promised to keep my secret to himself till death. He was absolutely okay with my bisexuality but when it came to hugging or sticking close, he started becoming concious. </p>
<p>One day he leaked my secret to his gf. We had the worst quarrel. Even aftr sorting the things out, its not working. </p>
<p>I respect him alot, so does he. But everytime we get physically close, our past comes in front. The crack once formed isnt getting repaired. Even last week v went to aquamagica where v were together the entire day, clicked so many sexy pictures. But he prefers staying away (physically) and doesnt talk to me like a best frnd does.</p>
<p>I dont wanna lose him and i want that frndship before. Plz temme what should i do</p>
<h1>GCI- DO NOTHING FOR HIM OR FOR YOURSELF IN THIS.....time will sort this out.</h1>
