<p>Hi
This is a confession about my very first come-out to a friend</p>
<p>So it goes like this..
I have a classmate who is my best of friends.. I met him on very first day of my college three year ago but became good friends..around two year back..</p>
<p>Then I was attracted to him and slowly we became very close friends..</p>
<p>So then I decided to tell him about my sexuality one day but then I didnt had the courage..</p>
<p>So one night four months back, I texted him that I am gay and slept as I knew he must have been asleep..</p>
<p>Next morning when I woke up I saw his reply "Its Ok yaar:)"
Seeing this I dont know what happened to me..I was not sad but started crying lying in my bed.. It felt so Good.. And it went on for 1 hour..</p>
<p>All I wanted at that time was to hug him tightly..</p>
<p>Today I very happy to have him as a friend and all the feelings I had for him are gone..
I m glad that I have him as a friend..my BEST FRIEND.</p>
<h1>GCI- That is so sweet! Good that your friend is understanding.</h1>
