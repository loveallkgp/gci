<p>Being gay, I had a tormented childhood. Got criticized on my activities, got bullied, became everyone's laughing stock. And than I decided to shut it all out, Turned a total sociophobic , slowly people got tired of my unbaised reaction to their comments . And for once i had a peaceful phase. But it didn't last long.... It was spring , new beginning and a new semester. He entered in my life. He was different from others kind and caring. Don't know was it his perfume or something but he smelled of musk. And though he wasn't that much attractive but yet i felt gravitated towards him. I though of it as just a fleeting crush.... Days passed and I never came to know when my life turned upside down. Don't know why he joined our little circle of friends. But at that time I just didn't care, because his presence was enough to make feel me lively :) And in just few days we developed a strong bond. My friends started seeing the changes in me and i got allocades for it. He was the reason for it....He was the reason for it. Within a year I was the complete opposite of the person I was. But one thing never changed and that were my feelings for him, I suspected him of reciprocating my feelings. He gave many subtle hints, kissing me on cheek, grabbing my ass. Talking his heart out to me, and many more. But I had never the courage enough to talk to him about that . And slowly time drifted away , and our time together was coming to an end. After the finals , he went back to his city and than I realized how hard I have fallen for him and he was not there to catch me :`( I tried his contacts but figured that he no longer have them. And now months later I met him on FB. But he is not same person anymore. Don't know why we had a tightlipped and stressed conversation and he wasn't replying actively... He was the one who made me who I am, but now he isn't acknowledging and it hurts a lot and I have got only our memories to cherish :( </p>
<h1>GCI- Its hard to control your feelings but you should know that sometimes things should fall apart to make space for new things. Take every end as a new beginning.</h1>
