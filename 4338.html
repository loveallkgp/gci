<p>Hii everyone
I have a small problem.
I entered into this fb and started chatting.I met a person in fb,he is a foreigner and i made friendship beecausr he is very far away and we couldnot meet.But he likes me very much but i too like only for frndship.He nows comes to india and wanted sex with me.I dono whether to go with him or not.I was away from local members for fear of being get addicted and now he comes.What should i do??He is coming especially for me.For his love i should go with him and make satisfy him??</p>
<h1>GCI- Did he specifically say that he wants to have sex with you? If yes, and you do not want it then you can always say it to him and deny him. If not, then stop assuming and spend some quality time with him either way.</h1>
