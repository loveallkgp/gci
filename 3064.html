<p>Hey n hii to all (Male-27) Strictly straight, so can i confess here??;) In train on d way to delhi..so thought of sharing about my.life. I am from simla, tall, fair and decent looking. Made my 1st gf at the age of 19... Lost my virginity with her. I know i was way too late in.life to get into 1st relationship. But trust me, since that day there is no looking back. Lol. Uptil now i had flirted with endless no of girls may be near to 40 or 50. I had 19 gfs till now and i have slept with 4 of them. I had 2 one night stands...also in a Friends with benefit relationship. Yeah..you may say i.am bragging but i am not. Trust it or not..its your take. All d gals i hv been or are in my life says that i am the biggest casanova/womanizer they have come across. Well may be they are right but i dont consider it a quality. Its just that i cant stop myself from flirting.Honestly speaking, i have Never Ever in my life cheated on any girl. I have been.in.love also but was sort of dumped by my ex. I fear being in love n so my list keeps on increasing. Just because of me being flirt doesnt mean that i consider gals as objects of timepass or pleasure. No..hell no...i respect girls a lot. I even hsd been in relationship with 2 gals who were flatmates...lol(talent you see). Jokes apart- I know the value of a woman in the making of a family...hats off to alk the girls out there. Plz stop being bful yaar;p I think that i sort of may b did wrong with 3 gals...but i did personally apologized later to all of them and they all accepted my apology...thank you for such a big forget full n big heart. Current status...ummm well flirting with two 21 yrs old chicks:p oops sory gals...haha...sorry bad pj I will marry a bful educated n independent gal 4 sure...n i am way above askin.."oh r u virgin?" type mentality. Khud maze kare to dusre par ungli thode kr sakte hai. After mrg...no flirt no flings...one woman man i will be(Hopefully;) All right guyz...live n let live...love all..respect girls Eat sleep n have good sex...but do not compromise with your profession. Oh i forgot to tell sumthn...i am workin in an automobile company n basically was an biology student...awkward combo right...lol This is life my friends. Plz stop rapes/acid attacks. ELTON JOHN- IMAGINE.... tc n tata good people Thnx for bearing with me NTN</p>
