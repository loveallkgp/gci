<p>Yesterday I saw the Webbed Show which was based on Gay guys Story On A 17 yrs guy Ved From Mumbai and 26 yr guys Anurag from Allahabad based in Mumbai for work. After watching tht 43.16 min show since that m feeling Insecure of being Such incident in my life. Few days back my family were asking for my marriage with a gal in which the put up me a Question tht " m I all right or comfortable with Gals !?" My situation is like Ved in my child hood me n my big brother (age gap of 8yrs ) had a gud relation as the time passes he wanted to rule on me. we dnt have any proper conversation. Been many yrs bt even though he scold me every time indirectly though m 26 yrs old from Varanasi bt what to do. I feel really bad after watching the show I didn't even talk any 1 till nw. Infact one of my gay Frnd said tht Ved life is just like urs..... Bt wat abt Anurag seriously our social environment is not allowing us to servive.... Infact I get many guy to live with who want to get settle with me last time I met a guy here only bt he wanted to rule on me... M although need some space.... N ya every Human has right to live with his choice. Anurag may ur soul rest in peace.... I wish I get a guy like Ved n Anurag :(</p>
<h1>GCI- Sabse pehle yeh samajh lo ki life filmy nhi hoti aur jab filmy ho jaye to hume badalna padta hai.</h1>
<p>If I am to say regarding your circumstances I will put it as clear as I can-
1- U must not think too much on the aspect of people being there for moral policing you all the time.
2-  U live in a town is understandable but remember one golden rule of living life on your own terms IF U CANNOT GIVE A FUCK TO WHAT TRIES TO MEDDLE WITH U then u need to work on yourself more.
3- People have one main problem in our country i.e To comment on others' life so better 'stand out' because no one is gonna stand for u if u don't stand for yourself first.
4- If u want to adjust then adjust only with what makes u grow inspite of making u uncomfortable.
5- Love, life and laurels are meant for those who earn them.
6- Elder siblings who dominate too much or partners who do the same suffer from personality disorders and my boy its NOT U  who can fix it, its their problem but never let their SHIT affect u.
7- Once u learn how to deal with your mental graph u won't be bothered by others' psycopath graphical curves at all.
8- Stop playing the victim card and having sympathy bcoz the more u will sympathise upon urself the more hypocrite u shall become. 
9- If you think u can't do anything for yourself then every advise and suggestion will just be a naught and nothing else for u.</p>
<p>P.S- Try to become what u are bcoz the more u will try to falsify ur truth the more hurt u will be over and over again!</p>
