<p>hiya admins :) I am that mosquito lover wala guy, i confessed here previously. Your advices and blessings paid off, me and my lovely mosquito have passed nearly all differences , we have gone through all bases in our pitch (if you are getting what i mean), but yet here i am seeking for another advice from you. I am sexually frustrated :\ my love mosquo is to thin(where it is needed) to satisfy me and this it showing effects in our love life. I have already started feeling annoyed by his humming habit and to make matter worse he leaves hickeys ;) all over me. I have started second guessing my love for him. Is it beginning of the end, or just a impass :`( . I feel like crying, only you guys can help me out . Waiting for your advices PS: #viv , i never knew you went to hogwarts, may be will meet some day in that potion class. :)</p>
<h1>Viv- My dear Lord! You are going through it already? But you have to understand honey, he is a mosquito and you have to accept him the way he is. A mosquito is always better than a cockroach without antlers. If you have second thoughts then buzz it out with him. Just keep your tears away from him. You don't want him to get drowned, do you?</h1>
<p>PS: Meet me in the charms class and I'll show you what I can do with my mighty wand. ;)</p>
