<p>hello all..., 
i m a girl, and i want to seek a serious advice and perspetive from u guys.., i am in love with a guy and he is my best friend as well, we are together from past 5 years, my love started growing from the first day i saw him and it is getting intense day by day and few days back he told me about his sexuality that he is a "gay" i was all numb !!! not because he is a "gay" but because he is the only pron for whome i felt love and i cud see no probability of having him, so i decided to stay calm and silent that time to think upon the mattter and come back again, but by my silence he interpreted that i was not ok by knowing about his sexuality..., 
i want to live whole life with him, his sexual orientation doesnt matter to me, we can be best friends and ultimately his family might also be wanting him to get married so should i say him that i love him and when time comes i wud also marry him. our age is 23 yrs. and we both are software engineers. we have same caste. i cud see no problem coming..,
"MY QUESTION"-- SHOULD I PROPOSE HIM FOR MARRIAGE AND ASSURE HIM OF MY SHOWERING LOVE ON HIM THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES, HOW SHOULD I APPROACH HIM ?? ARE THERE ANY CHANCES OF ME ABLE TO SATIATE HIM PHYSICALLY (although its not an ultimate deed but certainly can be considered as an essential part of life) ?? 
please please help me people...... :( :( :( :( </p>
<h1>GCI- You invested 5 years of your life, hence you are thinking it from your point of view. I am sorry it all happened to you. While you want to spend your entire life with him, same cannot be said about him. Have you talked to him about it? And I am assuming that you have been completely monogamous with him in these years, again, same thing cannot be said about him. If you are okay with him having sex with guys, then it's all fine. But you should have a proper talk with him about every possible situation should you both decide to live together. Sometimes these things do turn toxic later in years. Be prepared and take wise decisions by keeping your feelings aside.</h1>
