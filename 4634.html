<p>this life is really making me mad about myself.i dont know whether iam smart or not,intelligent or not,i hate my life.
i met many guys online but never dared to meet some one in person and never found the right guy yet .when they say iam top looking for bottom i get frightened and dont dare to continue dont know who to trust ,and now i have no one near to cry...
in both the lifes always alone away frm others and no one around.
i dont know why i was given such a stupid life why iam not like other guys who have lots of friends and what i should do about it..
i decided that when on jan 5-10i go to bangalore i will kill myself happily so that i cant be a mere problem to any one and no one could know who iam,.waiting for the end day of life.
thanks for this page dude it helped me alot by ur confessions so i always loved ur page alot
thankxxx admin this secret should be btwn me and my g-friends s that they r the only one who could know about it and will know yup i heard this before</p>
<h1>GCI- You get frightened when someone asks you about the preference on bed? Damn I get so bored that I can even watch straight porn and still find it interesting.</h1>
<p>And this page has never helped you at all. If it had, you wouldn't be talking about suicide. I don't think that you mean it rather. Also, apps like these are bound to make you sad when you get naked bodies when you search for the soul. DO NOT THINK ABOUT SUICIDE. Instead work for something better.</p>
