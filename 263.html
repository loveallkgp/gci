<p>19 m mumbai</p>
<p>well this is a suggestion rather than confession..</p>
<p>i have a book which is written by professional mediation..</p>
<p>he has mentioned that a straight guy can turn into a bisexual then its sure bisexual guy can too turn onto straight.. vice versa..</p>
<p>he said that ''straight guys actually turn into bisexuality only becoz of physical stuffs with same gender...
so if anyone wants to change there sexuality then they should do a hard work for atleast 2years.. one should try to harder and harder to ignore boys .. yes it sounds impossible but if u can do then effects of your works will be seen after years.. one should make physical relationship with girls atleast 2-3 times a month for target years...</p>
<p>you will probably see a desire and interest on girls more then boys.. dont see any gay porn or straight porn.. u should watch lesbian porns, do not jerk imaging males, just totally ignore boys things.. keep concentrate on your target... its a die hatd work but will work for every bisexual guys. "</p>
<p>bas itna hi likh paya :p .. boht long he ye suggestion .. but i wrote main points..</p>
<p>IS IT TRUE??</p>
<p>and guys i m gonna tryna it out making a target of 3 years..
3 years me changes ayega to i will be glad :) :) coz i dont want a dual life.</p>
<h1>Viv- I don't think that is true.It seems like a work of person who is a homophobe. Who believes that "cure" exist. But what is the GD problem with your sexuality? Try it for 3 years. And in the 4th year contact me and tell me if that worked out for you. In the number of cases that I have seen, nothing like this happened. No matter how hard you try, your sexuality will come back to you. So rather than running away from it you could face it like a man. There are many people here who are confused. If you these kind of views better not bring it here and make them depressed by making them think that they have some kind of disease. Ciao.</h1>
