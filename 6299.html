<p>Thank you GCI for taking the initiative on educating people on equal rights. Seems like more or less, everyone has got it right. 
Let's also discuss about other issues that are crippling our community from within.  The amount of "internalised homophobia" I have seen on this page is beyond my understanding and it makes me feel sad. We all are part of the rainbow colours, the colours of diversity.. How many of us know the actual importance of our rainbow flag? 
How many of us understand ordeals of  transgenders?
How many of us understand bisexuality that some of our brethren have the audacity to go ahead and tag them as "naturally born sluts"?
Why this mediocre attitude towards effeminate gay men? We all talk about 'being ourselves'.. Then what's wrong in being campy if they feel that way from within?

I understand we all have our preferences.. We like certain things and certain things, we don't.. But you don't have to be so insensitive towards something you don't agree with.. Let's be nice to each other and accept the diversity everyone has to offer... We might never know what challenges each one of us is going through..</p>
