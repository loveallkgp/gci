<p>"Me and my bf have been together now for 3 months. Though we want to meet regularly, due to our busy schedules, we get to meet only about once in 2 weeks. Though we chat regularly everyday. He stays alone, so every time I would go to his room. After eating something, he  would take me straight to bed and we would cuddle. I enjoyed this a lot, I told him in the beginning itself I don't like sex, he agreed. 
But the last time we met, he said ""I'm gonna rape you tonight"", I thought he was just joking, but he really meant it- though I started screaming so he didn't go very far. He apologized for his behavior but said he needs sex. So i contacted a call boy and paid him to have sex with my bf, they're gonna do it tonight. I feel guilty, I don't know if I did the right thing.   "</p>
