<p>Synopsis of six nights of so called love</p>
<p>28 and still closeted and can't afford to come out but accepted my sexuality. Out of frustration of loneliness I made a profile on PR (thanks to GCI and few virtual friends for this info). Profile without pic and don't entertain photo requests. Sometimes I feel that I should show my pics initially but I don't trust others easily so don't share pics. Met 3-4 people and talked to 10-12 people over phone. Most of these conversations ended because I was unable to find emotional compatibility or they found me too emotional and clingy without actual benefit to them. The people I met, might be, were looking for instant sex or if I ignore their pats on my back or attempts to kiss,  didn't find me attractive enough 'coz I am an average looking guy. I don't like being touched by strangers may be because of my childhood experiences or other unknown reasons. Shared my number with this guy too.</p>
<p>1st night:
Heard a voice that was stranger yet sounded so familiar and comforting. I was in dilemma whether to talk or not. Mind denied, heart accepted. Followed heart. At first he appeared so different but as the more words exchanged I felt that he was my alter ego. He too was searching for the love, care, and stability in his life. Might be he needed me and I needed him.</p>
<p>2nd night:
I was furious over myself for the failures at work place. I didn't know why I called him. May be I found a comfort zone in him. We talked that day..we talked and talked. I was sharing all to him that I kept to myself for years and he was sharing his years of experiences. It was like two separated soulmates were connected by destiny..</p>
<p>3rd night:
The feeling was so intense. I checked calls and messages every now and then. May be for the first time I realized how exactly it feels. Came to know that he was unwell and I was sleepless all night in worry, awaiting next information about his well being.</p>
<p>4th night:
Amidst crowd, I was longing for some other place. The shoulder of my beloved, his hands holding mine, ensuring peace to my wandering heart. He wanted to meet me. I felt at that moment that he too started building expectations and I was going to be judged over his parameters. Earlier I told him that I was an average looking guy. He told me he was too. I prepared myself mentally to stick with him even if I find him little bad in looks because I liked the voice that had care. I had questions that what if I don't find good-enough? My personal experience told me time gives acceptance based on the merits and demerits of the person. I will give him more time to know and accept. At the same time I was worried too because I didn't know what expectations he was building about me. Next day I decided to meet as soon as possible to give more clarity to this relation. The end result was same for what I was worried. I found a sorry note on PR.</p>
<p>5th night: 
I never knew I could be this weak. I would get so much attached to a person in 4-5 days. I couldn't sleep. I was consoling my heart. The night became unbearable. I was looking almost every moment at my phone thinking what if he changes his mind. After all I have loved him and if our feelings were true then he too would be feeling the loss. He too needed me then how suddenly I could go out of his mind! Next morning, I read on someone's wall that if you love someone you should pursue it with intensity. I loved him so decided to try my best. I got a call. He had complaints and doubts about my love. I asked myself that would he had been asking the same questions if I was better looking. That moment I realized that I don't look good enough. I hated my face more that day.
I was in dilemma whether to hold on or move on.</p>
<p>6th night:
I was tired of all the feelings, mess in my head, and the many sleepless nights...still unable to sleep. Looked into mirror..at my puffy and red eyes. Asked my self that if I was not going to take care of myself then who would. Felt someone saying to me that don't worry child..what you are seeking is also seeking you. Have faith. So, left everything on fete. If it's destined to happen, it will happen.
May be somewhere, someone is waiting for me..his prayers have more intensity and power than mine..that's why I failed in all my earlier attempts. I know this thought is foolish but right now it's working to console myself for a while.</p>
