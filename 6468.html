<p>My ex wanted me back. So I gave him the second option. I told him you can talk to me but as soon as I spoke these words he shrugged his shoulders . started ignoring me. I went to his room ,I said ,day before yesterday you yourself was talking to me now you don't want to talk.
He said he is not interested in talking to me.
What the fuck. Is he playing mind games ? I don't understand him.
When his friends ask him why he does n't talk to me ,he answers he wants to talk but am the one not talking.
When I talk he doesn't want to talk.
I m tired of him.
Should I never talk to him?
He has hurt me already a lot .</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, just say, "Figure out what you wan to do. Don't just keep yourself on a hook to dangle here and there", and leave him alone with his thoughts.</h1>
