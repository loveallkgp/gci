<h1>GCi- Well if you are in a relationship then it is the duty from both the sides that you discuss about the issues. What is the use of a relationship if you can't trust him with your secrets. That's one point down for your guy. Next thing is that he thinks tha if you become the doctor, you will forget him. He is passing the judgment without even knowing you. Do YOU feel that way? If no, then clear it out on his face.</h1>
<p>To me it seems like he wants to go away and in a way he is trying to put it on you. It will be okay to clear the air out between the two of you. If these things still persist then listen to your friends.</p>
