<p>It was hate at first sight. During my MBBS sirf woh hi tha jis ke karan mein bar bar second rank hota tha. I was always used to being the topper and it was annoying to have to compete with someone else to claim that spot. It was not an easy job either because we always seemed to score similarly.</p>
<p>As fate had it we were grouped together during a charity fundraising event. We had to work together for a week and it was very evident to everyone in our group that I hated him. I never smiled at him and used minimum words to express myself when interacting with him. On the other hand he did not seem to mind my behaviour at all. The fundraiser was a success and after the event was over he asked me to meet him in one of the classrooms. I was like "Oh God ab isko kya chahiye???" So I went to see him. As I entered he faced me and seemed to be a bit nervous. He started talking and I was still rude. After a while he just grabbed me and gave me a peck on my lips. By the time I could respond he was already running out of the class.</p>
<p>That night I could not take him off of my mind. I kept replaying the incident and couldn't help but stupidly smile. Hating him for giving me a challenge in my academics had made me completely overlook his good looks and athletic build. Subconsciously I must have had a crush on him which made me hate him even more. The next morning I met him and was really nice to him. And so we began our friendship which quickly turned into a love affair and we became inseparable. 10 years later we are both doctors and lovers. We live together and our parents think that we are just best friends. I hope one day we have the courage to let them know the truth.</p>
<p>Anyway who knew that the guy I despised so much would one day be my boyfriend. And what really are the chances of a gay guy meeting his boyfriend in college while studying for the same career? I feel blessed and thank God everyday. I love you baby xx</p>

<h1>Viv- Honestly, you gave me chills! It looks like Disney fairy tale. Couples like you make me believe that love do exist in gay people. God bless you both and have a wonderful life!</h1>
