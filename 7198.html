<h1>GCI- First of chill and take a breath. U</h1>
<p>1- Are saturated by sex for the tym being.
2-  Must stop overthinking about love and shit like that.
3- Have become hyposexual for the time being and its ok after sex for a long tym.
4- Are still having the notion of 'tu nhi toh aur sahi aur nahi toh koi aur sahi' unknowingly.
5- Are not able to align your emotions, physical needs and spiritual quotient.
6- Must work on urself on all the levels and do not burden urself with any emotion, be it of love, relationship, of your sexuality or of being in an asexual phase.</p>
<p>P,S- Stop thinking on multiple issues at the same time and start segregating them on the different levels. Once you have done understanding what u really desire and can do u will see urself metamorphosing into something new and light.</p>
<p>Goodluck honeydew!</p>
