<p>Hi admin, I work in a Indian firm creating medical equipment. Recently one of my colleagues found gay app Grindr on my phone when I went to toilet. I begged him not to tell anyone. But he told everyone. Every day is nightmare since then. Most of my colleagues stand far away while talking to me and don't sit with me for lunch. When I go to toilet they say ladies toilet udar hai. they have started calling me nano car since engine is behind. One guy even asked me to get married soon so he and others can enjoy with her. I even complained to manager but he said I must understand their fear of gays and not worry unless someone beats me. I won't find any other job since I am very junior. I feel like killing myself.</p>
<h1>GCI- That's pure bullying. Is there something like anti-bullying law and regulation at your workplace? If there is, then please complain to them. If not, then complain to your seniors. If nothing works, do find another job with LGBT friendly environment. DO NOT GIVE UP and DO NOT THINK ABOUT SUICIDE.</h1>
