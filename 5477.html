<p>Im a kinda reserved, sensitive guy. Have a few relationships in past; some, best and others, incompatible. had broken up with a crush a few months back and was trying ways to heal me.</p>
<p>Yesterday happened to chat wid a guy who turned out to be my dream boy. I usually speak less with strangers but i happened to show greater interest to this guy and spoke openly. He's a sportsman, straight; for him it is fuck and forget with Gays.</p>
<p>Though he approached me for sex, started liking my friendly behaviour and said, "you are like my best friend and so no fun wid you" as he makes either best friendship or fun but not both wen it comes with Gays. which disappointed me, Coz hes my dream boy and I love every feature of him. We started speaking in evening in fb and continued to speak whole night on phone.</p>
<p>We kept on speaking speaking on phone abt family friends likes dislikes etc etc... I definitely know that he liked me, though he came for sex he wanted to be in touch wid me also and choose to be my best friend life long....we kept on speaking and slept at early morning...</p>
<p>Dont know what happened, The next day he stopped speaking. no response even if i msg that morning. he is online but never responds me. Why did this happen :(</p>
<p>My interpretation is : "he is a straight and curious/confused bi who likes gays only for fun. with me though he felt more friendly... as we started to speak more he started feelings towards me like i did. the feelings wer sweet to me, but wer awkward to him as it is new to him wid a guy and so he avoided me, let go and moved on which is difficult to me :("</p>
<p>It really hurts me when people come into ma life and leave me for no reason :( Please tell is it his mistake or mine? should i change myself :( Im really dying please help me friends :(</p>
<h1>GCI- First thing first.. stop expecting a relationship from every person you talk to. If you knew that he is not a relationship material, then you should have just stayed as friends with him. You are gonna get nothing from it anyway.</h1>
