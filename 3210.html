<p>hey everyone how to know a person is a gay???or intrested in males?? im being frustrated these days seeking for a gay male...i have lota of friend in my fb id but internally I dont get a courage to have a face to face contact with them....what to do?? I really wanna meet someone and pass sometime with him...i get so angry n jealous when I see a couple.. why I dont have?? really im badly missing these feelings being with a bf...what should be done to increase the self confidence?? how can I remove my fear of meeting someone through fb chat n go on a date??</p>
<h1>GCI- You can't get face to face with anyone because you are scared to come out to anyone, even if it is a gay person. You can't see yourself tagged as a bad person. To get over this feeling you first have to shed the fear that by mingling you are not doing anything wrong. Socializing is not a bad thing. However, socializing with some people and then making bad decisions is totally a whole other chapter. To date someone, you can have a set of expectations like</h1>
<p>what type of guy you want to be with?
what are you gonna talk with the guy?
How fast you could trust him?
How his nature should be?
ETC and other questions like this. Talk online with a person first and I don't mean a sex chat. Get to know his nature rather than the top/bottom thing and the dick/ass size. And if anyone says anything which you do not like, don't be afraid to say no.</p>
