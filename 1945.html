<p>I don't really know whether I should be writing this or not and I suppose the reason behind it is that I'm affraid of what you or others may say. That fear stems from what I think I already knows, but I can't hide away from the realities of life. I'm 35 and a British born Asian, I'm gay and have always kept my personal life very personal but at the beginning of this year I met a guy over the net. It was in a social networking site and completely by chance. Both he and I were very reluctant to meet and hours before our first meeting he would message me via email, because he would give me his mobile number and say that perhaps we shouldn't meet etc he had a real fear that perhaps we one each other and that might make things awkward etc oh I forgot to mention that we both knew the purpose of the meeting, to enjoy each other. Anyway we met I took him back to my flat we chatted and then got down to business but I didn't have sex with him just other fun. The reason for not having sex was because I was at that point an anal virgin. I hadn't allowed anyone to fuck me. I always thought I would wait for the right guy. It was him. He was the right guy and I knew after our first meeting I wanted him to be my first. As I was saying the months went by and I fell for him head over heels no doubt about it. He have me his mobile number and I pinned for his company. We spend hours every night chatting and we still chat at night but not as much I suppose. I eventually plucked up the courage to ask him to fuck me and he was really happy. He was very very patient. When I tried the first time I failed and it was too painful but we kept trying and eventually managed it. Now we have sex maybe two or three time everytime we meet. When in bed he's amazing very caring talks about how he really loves me but I'm not blind to the fact that he is due to get married in April next year and I'm the only friend he has invited to the wedding. I know he craves my company too because he messages me in the morning in fact as soon as he wakes up, then at lunch and then in the evenings and then before he goes to bed. He shares every problem with me and when we are together alone he's amazing. But on ocassions he disappears off the radar he behaves like he doesn't care he says things like I could away and he's immune from the effects of any break up. In fact we have broken up in the past and always patched things up, he's always come back and apologised. I thing our relationship has changed from one of sex to one of brotherly love and companionship, is that weird? Is it insestuious? He calls me his big brother and has even told his family about me. His father speaks to me as if I am his elder brother. Everyone we meet we have sex. He holds me close to his chest each time. But in the next breath says I can't live without you and u are gona be my children's uncle etc and has given me full responsibility to name all his children and has said he will move closer to me when he is married so we can calm upon each other daily. I don't know what kind of a relationship we are in but the sex part is amazing. I just don't trust him and I feel because I love this guy I have let myself I for a whole world of pain which is waiting for me around the cornor or am I being over sensitive and just let this run it's course</p>
<h1>GCI- What the hell is wrong with people? Being gay or a bi doesn't give anyone a license to cheat in a relation or marriage? And then society says that we are not loyal. Is the society to be blamed or its pure us? I think the latter.</h1>
