<p>I met a guy Anuj online who said he was bicurious and we agreed to meet at his place. It was a very dirty locality but the guy was hot so I agreed to go up with him.  We kissed a little and he went to bathroom. I noticed his icard from some mall he was working in. In that he had beard and his name was Wasim. It was most terrifying moment of my life. Will it be my last day today? Was I trapped by a religious homophobe? Was he getting a knife or something from inside? I didn't even dress properly just ran and ran till reached main road. He gave several calls after that but I didn't answer. I am just so grateful to be alive. Please be careful of online people.</p>
<h1>GCI- Precaution is necessary but what you did was entirely stupid too. Based on his name, you assumed that he was gonna kill you because of his beliefs? Are you fucking nuts? If you think that people with a particular religion are a problem, then you are not good either. There is no sympathy from my side to you. YOU are just as much as the part of the problem that exists in the mind of people.</h1>
