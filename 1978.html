<p>I am 19 years old .
Thou! I am in a relationship with my fisrt and last boyfriend,but my first crush and one sided love still  haunts me ,haunts me in the sense i tried to forget him ,i don't even wonder or think of him but still i always wake up with a dream of him ,a dream in which we are like continuing our bestfriend wala friendship ,roaming around hand in hand , like we used to do ( &amp; what else we use to do i won't write that stuff ova here its our memories)  and with such dreams i end up with his memories again ! So  i want to forget him but somtimes i feel as far as i dont speak or talk about him it will no harm my relationship ..somtimes i feel it will , i thought of telling entire thing to my boyfriend  believing that he loves me alot and he won't be hurt with it but if he gets hurt than it will hurt me more  and this may losen the knot of our  relationship , ! :( i at all don't wanit to happen and these dream aren't lettin' me to forget my first crush'love ,i oftenly have his dreams ,romantic dreams , x'xy dreams , the dreams .....if this was like  those of any other small problem s people have in a healthy relationship i would have handled it in my own way but i ain't gettin any solution  so i thought of sharing my trouble/ fear with my pals ....... I know coffession is so dreamy but i want to know from you pals  that whats wrong with me i tried many alternative stuffs to forget him and divert my mind   , but al in vain ! Reason The Dream ! Can anyone tell me how can i avoid to have his frequent dreams ?

Thanks! 
Dhanyawad! 
Shukriya!
Merci!</p>
<p>PS:- itni muskil se eklota husband material banda mila hai , rait mai sui  k jaise dhunda  ,who loves me more than he love himself  so i must not hurt him in any way !  </p>
<h1>gci : first of all we don't bring out gramatical mistakes ... we just say write the word properly instead of writing them in short ..like they write 'messaging ' as msgng or missed as mssd ,or so many short forms of words which are self made and can't be understood .</h1>
<p>secondly ...darling you are just 19 ... and don't just make things in ur mind like ' husband material ' ' first and last bf '... these things sounds good in daily soaps . in reality lot of break ups happen before we meet the one we decide to stick to no matter how un perfect they are .thats only bacause of past experiences . </p>
<p>thirdly getting rid of first crush ' one sided love' is not easy . its been 5 years and i still get mini heart aches when i think of my first crush inteen years . so it will fade slowly just try not to make any further contact with your crush . and keep on with your bf and no need to tell him about your first crush .. that will make him feel like useless or being used .</p>
