<p>"This is in response to confessions #3298 #3302, I m a constant reader of this page I dont respond often though but was always happy with the situation in the page in which everybody suggest solutions to each other, encourage each other and even some may have found love here... but those confession is causing quite a disruption in the page which I m not comfortable with.<br>
  Yes ! I can marry  a girl and live a normal life to others. But what will that do? Forget satisfying her, How can I be satisfied? I can close my eyes and kiss her even though I may not like it, but it will be nothing compared to the kiss he will give me when he comes back from work. I may give her expensive gifts, but what is that? when he has tickets for a late night romantic movie? I can sleep with her every single day, it will be nothing when I get up every morning tangled next to him. I may take her for a romantic dinner which will be nothing when we take a shower togather. I can even have a baby with her but I would only be more happy when he suggests which kid to adopt...If I marry her my life would be like the fake profile I created here... I created a fake profile so I can find him, that there will that one person who will stand with me when I come out to the society. 
  I cant just satisfy myself with meeting him over a weekend behind her. It is not sex I m after, I want him to be my better half. He has to complete me in all aspects. A girl can never give me what he will give me. Yes, he will give me love. He will give strength to stand up against the world. He will give his life if necessary so I can be happy. You cant just force that kind of love for any girl who means nothing to u. Confessor #3302 I hope u r reading this. Your brother told u he is gay because he wanted a real life and he will get a real life. Your brother loves his boyfriend and would stand by him just like u would stand by your girlfriend if it is necessary. If ur God doesnt allow it then screw ur God. If ur Society doesnt allow it then screw your Society. If ur family doesnt allow it then screw ur family. If he wanted sex, he would have married her and meet him behind her back. Realize that people like us walk upon the earth, we have always been there. From the artistic Leonardo Da Vinci, who was way past his time and the brave Alexander the Great who conquered half the earth to other countless people were all Gays and we existed and did great things apart from having sex. So what if I m frowned upon, so what if I m being talked behind, it will all be nothing when I hold his hand and walk down the street.<br>
  Dont complain others for having a fake profile, make sure you dont have a fake life. We have one life and make it real. For those who think u can lead a fake life, I pity u. U will miss all that with your man. All you will be is a sex demon who has sex with a stranger to satisfy ur animal needs. And all demons will go to hell, not because you were gay, but because you have been a demon. You have been warned. "</p>
