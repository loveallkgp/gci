<p>Hi. I'm 17 years old. My confession might not be as tragic compared to what you guys usually post.
I'm gay and pretty good looking so yeah my life's isn't really all that sad.</p>
<p>But I just can't accept myself for the way I am. There was a time when I was so frustrated that I had started to self harm. I used to cut almost on a daily basis. I still do but it's more of a once a week thing now.</p>
<p>Wherever I go be it my home, school, tuitions, anywhere, there are homophobes everywhere. I don't feel like I belong. It's like I'm this alien trapped in this world of humans. I just CANNOT fit in anywhere. I was diagnosed with some Anxiety Disorder a few months back. I don't really have any 'good friends'. I mean it's not like I'm a complete loner but I just find it difficult to get along with all the heterosexual people out there. They make me feel inferior. just want someone who's like me and understands what I go through on a daily basis. I made this account solely for that but all I find is retarded old men and people wanting to fuck my brains out. Why did 'God' create me this way? I don't think I'll ever know. Guess I'll just have to live with it.</p>
<p>PS Once I get a job, I plan on leaving this country and go somewhere where stupid ass laws like 377 don't exist. </p>
