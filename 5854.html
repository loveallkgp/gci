<p>Hey everyone!
To introduce myself I am an 18 year old bisexual guy studying in a degree college.
The thing is there's a girl in my college who likes me and is always around me wherever I go whatever I do. She's good as a person but I dont wan't to take it to a relation which she is tending to. We're good friends but I don't want to hurt her :(
There were 3-4 girls in my college who had a crush on me but they just kept it in their fantasy world not like her giving attention to me when I am not interested.
Also there are two guys whom i met on fb who say they have a crush on me. One want's to be in a relation and the other one lusts me for a physical relation. I usually try to ignore them but its that they keep on texting me on whatsapp and it irritates me. &gt;_&lt;
The reason why I am doing this all is I like a guy and he likes me too. Its just that we are taking time to know each other.
 So I am confused how to treat those guys and that girl untill I know my guy well and would proceed further. Admins please do suggest some way! Thank You :D</p>
<h1>GCI- Suggest what??? Just don't use anybody in the process ur KNOWING EACH OTHER ...and additionally USE UR MOUTH TO SPEAK AND HANDS TO WRITE...BE STRTFORWARD....just be polite and say NO... to those whom u dont want to be with...One last thing...ur age is the age of peak of ur hormonal level- testosterones to be specific...Just control ur hormonal urges and never use anyone or anybody;s emotions in LOVE...AND SEX..otherwise it is just a DHOKHA!...and no one deserves to be cheated just bcoz they loved someones truly!</h1>
