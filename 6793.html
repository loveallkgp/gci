<p>Hello, First of all I want to clear that This is not a Confession, It is a gay love Story Of a Teenager written by Me, I hope you guys will like it, Shall we Begain now, #spank Today Is the worst day of life, early morning, my mom came back, after a couple of week and I was getting ready for my school, Yesterday I don't know How but my grandfather has know that I'm into guys, My Mom and Granpa were sitting and discussing about me, And My Grandpa was like "If He wants to be a girl then throw him out of the house". And My mom and sis were confirm that I'm a gay!!!! Today I got broken into pieces, coz my grandpa loves me a lot, before he came to know about my sexuality,  I left for school, When My teacher was teaching I put my head down and Started Crying, One of my friend saw And Asked me the reason, I haven't told him, then My friends made me laugh &amp; I was feeling better,  The school was over and I came back to my home, I just wanted to die.... as I came back I was alone at home, my mom was at market and my sis was is her college &amp; My Grandpa was in train 'coz He was returning back to Bihar.... I started searching for a rope So that I could Hang myself, But I was not able to find, Then I opened my Mom's cupboard and Took a Dupatta and I tied a knot in the fan &amp; other end was hanging down Then I tied another Knot on my neck, and I tried to Hang but As pulled my legs out of the bed I fell down and I started crying,  as I was crying I don't know when I slept, my mom came back from market and she saw all the things, and She got worried... After that, for a couple of days my mom was behaving nice to me but after 2 days She again started that stuff, Two Weeks Passed....... Tomorrow is Rakhsha Bhandhan And I'm going at my Mama's place along with my mom and Sis, I'm soo excited coz after a year I'm going back there, And I Have Spent my 6 years here, After a Day, THE REAL PART OF THE STORY BEGINS NOW... I'm soo tired and I have to pack my bags Coz We're going back, But Before I leave I asked my mom to meet my old friends, She said go, My Sis has gone For a scooty ride with my Maternal Aunt, Suddenly My little cousin came with a loud voice "Papa, mom has fainted!!!" I ran there to See, I saw my aunt and sis met an accident, I told my Maternal uncle and They took my aunt to the hospital, Next morning I was having my friend's phone and again my family was going to the Doctor and I was alone at home, I logged in my Facebook account and I found a guy from my city, I sent him friend request and He accepted that day we had a long conversation, Then after a couple of days we exchanged our contact no., that guy was very sweet his name was Ayush (Name Changed) Then I called him, he was kinda boring but sweet, He told me that He has a bf, whose name is Shashank. His bf don't let him live his life, don't let him make any friend, his bf has dated 15-16 guys, and Never told him that he is dating another guys!!!! To be Continued.......</p>
