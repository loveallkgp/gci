<p>Hey admin plz post it......I belong to a very small town n I always blame myself for tht why I born there:(.......people of my town they all think tht being a gay is a disorder.....I want to make them understand tht uts nt a disease its a feeling a very beautifull feeling.....it is love....im very much thankfull to my parents n my god tht they made me special.im studying in europe...I pursuing my degree from europe.i visit india every year during my holidays.whenever I talk to other gays tht im looking for a relationship.at the begnig they get agree bt when they come to knw tht m nt in india they say a big no bcz accordig to them long distance relationships doesnt work, I understand this point bt I believe distance is nohing if the feelings are true.bt they dnt understand his little thing.they just want tht their partner should be near to their city.so tht they can meet when ever they want .at last I just want to say tht plz change ur thinking abt l8ng distance relationship.</p>
<p>$ABBY : even i belong to small town where people think the same . but i have moved to a little big town and planning to move bigger town . you  know to make people realise first you shold become something ... something really big . </p>
<p>and its just a false theory that small town people have small minds.. even big towns have small mind people its just ... people their don't care ... everyone is busy ..</p>
