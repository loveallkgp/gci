<p>I m a gay . I loved once a straight person when i was of 16 and obviously it was one sided . After two years of that i got the idea that i m gay . Then a girl of my class proposed me , but i didn't accept her proposal . After 2 yrs when i was doing graduation she and me got close by talking in phone. So i disclosed that i m a gay to her . She loves me so much that after knowing the truth she still wanted to love me and to make me as her bf . She is the first person  before whom i could disclose this truth. Then after she became my best friend. There is a boy of her class who blindly and madly loving her . I always say her love that person who loves u so much . Don't take me as ur life partner , u will only suffer . But she says it is being too late to go back . As i don't have any one with whom i can share my feelings and love towards boys , i share with her , though she listen to me but she is hurted . Even i don't see my future  shining with my love . So i decide to stay with her . But i am unable to give her my love . I tried a lot to love her to give some pleasure to her but i m failed. I can care her and i can love her as a friend but i can't think her as my life partner . Her lover also knows that i m a gay and she loves me . So he has no tension for her about me . But he is so mad that he wants to marry her anyhow . On the other way she wants to marry me otherwise she will live her life alone . If i marry her or not marry i will be in same sad state . What can be done in this situation ?
Please suggest me . </p>

<h1>AdminViv- I know whatever im going to say will hurt u a lot. You have to let her go away from urself. U cant stay with her for a lifetime, u cant giver her the love se wants. And she also has to understand this. The best thing u could do is get close to a gay guy just or fake a relationship so that she can have a new heading with a guy who loves her. It will be very much difficult for u but u dont have to be sad. Sometimes things must be sacrificed for the greater good so that people whom u love can be happy in future.</h1>
