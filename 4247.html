<p>Hello GCI,
Need your help, I like one guy I stay in Mumbai n he stay at delhi, he is here for job may be after 1 or 2 year he will go back to delhi, we like eachother hence started dating eachother for me it's more than liking n I know I will take care of geographical boundaries in future.The problem is that he is thinking of marriage after 3 years as his parents will not support n life of gay is difficult in India, for I just know I love him n everything will get handle if we have trust in eachother. I don't understand how I should move further it's been 2 months we r dating we like eachother company n everything. He is genuine guy n me 2. I don't want to loose him but at the same time when I look at the future of both of us I got confused because wt will happen if he marry a girl in future under pressure.</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, know that if he doesn't change his decision you both are heading towards a disaster. He is not ready to take a stand(which he should) and it is not gonna end good for anyone. It will be bad for you, him and his future wife who does not know what is coming for her.</h1>
<p>Secondly, I hate it when people make fake promises in the name of relationship but actually don't have guts to live upto them. Clear the mind on what you want. You want a relation, a good long lasting relation, then fight the world for it. You are unclear of your relation with your partner? Then breakup before it goes toxic for either of you!</p>
<p>The road you both are heading towards is a sad one. Better take a stand now for yourself or it is gonna be difficult for you in future if he doesn't change his decision.</p>
