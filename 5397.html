<p>I came from a simple lower middle class family, born and brought up with traditional values and moral lessons. Guys always attracted me and so I started to search for them for satiating my sexual desires since the time I became aware of such feelings. Gradually I moved away from my native city with my job. This change in life was so overwhelming that I felt like I have got new wings to fly. There were no parents &amp; relatives to poke their nose into my life and I was in a new city with a new culture and people there not knowing my antecedents and my family. This anonymity was so empowering that I started to sleep with new guys randomly. It was just fun. Staying alone in a rented apartment I could easily call them for a night stay even. My contact started to grow. My sex life was so colourful. I was so happy that I have got so many friends in my life which would have never been possible otherwise, staying in my native place with family. But as people say life is a journey and we never know about our destiny, I started confronting with new experiences which started to change my whole perception about life and liberty. I realised that people can sleep with you and can hate you at the same time. I realised that they can so convincingly lie that you would never know what they actually stand for. It feels like shit hole when you know that your honesty is not being valued. I realised that sex can be like a drug, gradually making you hollow from inside. Yes, that hollowness started to suck. I slept like a whore with different guys and wept like a child when I was alone. I was living two lives at a time and life seemed like a mess, sleeping with shadows, when you need emotional support they all escaped in thin air. But God has been very kind. He realised my pain and confusion and showed me the way. I got a good, loyal life partner in my life. We have been together for more than five years and both of us doing well individually in life. I have stopped sleeping with other guys and both of us are very happy with each other. Although he is not quite handsome but I know that no one can love me more than him. But still life seems to be like an illusion. I am now moving away from sex. I know sex is important in a gay relationship, but still I am more satisfied with the emotional side of relationship instead of the sex thing. I don't understand why I am being so averse to sex. Sometimes, he ask me whether I am happy with him. I tell him he is the best man that I can have in my life. If it had been possible we together would have adopted a child but India being India, it is very difficult at this point of time. Personally I think that even in man-woman relationship sex become secondary aspect when they start loving each other and move on to the next level of relationship which is the life after marriage. I feel that there should be something else in our life other that sex. Atleast the Government should understand that GAY relationship is not all about sex. It is just like any other man-woman ralationship which longs for social acceptance, social security, legitimacy and a family of its kind. What is wrong in letting that happen ? Are man made customs and traditions so rigid that they can't be changed ?</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh honey, the customs change everytime. Right now, the whole world is living under the customs of Abrahmic religions. Three of them which were founded in one small piece of land, spread worldwide and their customs, their laws, their values became the part of everybody's local culture. Who knows what type of culture we had before these religions took over.</h1>
<p>I felt so happy after reading your confession. It's true that people really evolve. It's just that you have to accept certain things in order to realize your mistakes and move on. You have a beautiful thing going on. Do not give up on it. God bless you both and hope you guys live together for many years to come.</p>
