<p>Today i saw two gay guys in train.vaise to its hard to find bur what if someone is behaving girly and talking like girl.he was shouting like a girl trying to catch attention of other all ppl in train watching at him.i dont undrstan why gays have to show it to others.why cant they talk and behave normally evn im gay but i hate to all such girly things.i dont think its natural or inherent they do it intentionally to grab attention.plzz its req to all that plzz improve urself.</p>
<h1>GCI- While behaving in a foolish(irrespective of being girly) way in public is wrong but seriously, do you think that being girly is abnormal? What is normal according to you? Being too much proud of that little worm between your legs? That's what makes you man? If you are made to say that you are gay in the public, you balls would hang so low that even Satan would feel them on his head in hell. Please it is a request to you that please improve your thinking.</h1>
