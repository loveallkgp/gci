<p>hi
confessor of 5386 sandy
i apologize for using word rape and all . i didnt meant it. . i was actually raped by 2 people and i know how hard time dat was for me. and everyone came to know about this in my college but i actually deal wd d situtaion in a very confident way. but gci they way to commented is harsh its not a fetiesh. it was saidd in sarcasm . i didnt try to mean it..... and gci i have struggled very hard and the sacrifices i made at the age of 23 with great amount of difficuilties who guys could never imagined . and trust me u guys have not gone to that bad circumstances which i have gone through anyways god bless u all</p>
<h1>GCI- It's not about who has gone through less and who has gone through more. Everyone has gone through some or the other problem in their life. Myself as well. I am not undermining your issues. Do not undermine others as well. I apologize for the rudeness but I cannot stand if someone uses the word rape as a fantasy.</h1>
