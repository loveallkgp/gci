<p>P.S.- Admin, i don't have any words for uh.. uh r just one amazing person doing that job worth a million compliments..all i have to say is... thanx.. i mean it.. really.. :)</p>
<p>i'm sorry for this confession to be a long and padded one but its my life in this one confession.. nd beleive it or not but ADMIN has done a huge favor to me by posting it.. coz i know i'll be telling this to ppl like me.. not narrow-minded str8s ..who just have a single job - TO JUDGE</p>
<p>it all began wen i took admission in class 11th in a new school... just 16 of age i was completely new to this school.. i held my head down and off i went to my class ..everyone there was sitting in pairs.. just one girl sat there alone.. i didnt wanted to sit next to her so i examined the class again.. and found a guy sitting alone and doing some sort of work... i thought to sit there.. i asked him.. "can i?" he said "sure" it was wen i sat close to him i realised he's been writing the lyrics of a song...his name was amit.. he was kinda gentle and sweet and new to that school... it became our routine everyday we chatted and became freinds.. eventually by the end of three months we had become friends to four other students.. it was like a group.. with BFF's and deep freindship.. amit fell for one of a girl from our group and they both ended being in a relationship.. i didnt felt nice..i sensed some strange emotions tiding up within my heart.. it was awkward at first so i ignore those alien feelings.. but u just cant hold whats about to happen... i fell for him.. it took me time to make terms with the reality but i realised that i loved him truly and selflessly... two years passed it was about the ending of class 12th wen amit's gf broke up with him.. he sort of broke down.. he was ofcourse str8 and loved his gf like i loved him... madly.. :)wen she left her we both came to each other i was happy at the realisation that amit and i were spending grt times with each other.. by then my love for him knew no bounds.. i was ready to do anything ..for just this guy to be with me... i decided not to tell him.. fearing i cud lose him by doing so.. but time... its amazing.. isn't it.. it has been one year sinse we passed 12th.. my love reached new heights each day.. but wen amit stopped talking and communicated less.. i feared that the most beautiful colors of my life had begun to fade.. i started dying a new death everytime he would ignore me or would not talk to me...</p>
<p>it was a month ago.. wen i decided that this thing was really hurting me so i decided to snap all the strings of communication with him...a month has passed and amit hasn't called me or even texted me to know what has happend ..but on the other side i was hurting myself more.. killing myself more brutally than the last time...</p>
<p>but yesterday i was in a cyber cafe to fill my online application form for PMT exam.. coincidently to my surprise i saw a boy sitting there.. perfectly handsome and strongly built.. he was amit.. sitting there ..lost in his thoughts.. the moment i saw his face all the emotions and pain that i had put a dam to for last 1 month returned.. he ignored me.. we sat in a room .. so close yet so faaar.. i didn't fill the form..i cudn't stand him.. i went straight out of the cafe and cried .. like hell.. it felt like someone twisted a sharp knife in a green wound.. i realised how has everything changed time... conditions and AMIT but here i was completely unchanged.. loving him more than the last time..</p>
<p>it has just been yesterday and it feels like foreverthat i saw that perfectly sculpted face with god's amazing finece.. i want to talk to him now.. but i'm also scared that if i talked now i wud never be able to seperate myself from that godly human...</p>
<p>what should i do admin.. suggest a way.,.. i love him.. more than anybody has ever loved anyone in forever... &lt;3</p>
<p>am sure u'll be up with an advice and yeah thanx for posting it.. :)
god bless.. :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, I didn't get why he stopped talking with you because you never really told him anything about your feelings.</h1>
<p>Now listen, if he starts talking with you again, what would happen? Your feelings would again ignite and as he is straight, he would still be out of reach. He will never be how you would want him to be. Better thing would be, just be at peace with whatever is happening. It would be difficult but know that the guy who judged you and left you, was never your good friend. He let your sexuality define your character based on his assumptions. So stay away.</p>
