<p>So I stumble upon a daddy on one of the Romeo sites and we become acquainted. Little did i know that the "acquaintance" status would last for 2 years. It started with a lie as it usually does in a homophobic society like ours. This is a man who is in a pretty respectable position and married with children...a closeted homosexual burdened under the pressures of family and society living in a relationship without emotions...unable to forgo the inherent desires...afraid every second to get closer to the person he likes and the same time helplessly attracted to the "forbidden fruit" 
He usually calls me to narrate his one sided story....the story of his woes as a married homosexual and at the same time a pretentious self righteousness advocating the path he has taken for all......more of a talker than a listener...not at all bothered about hearing about what I have to say ...not even an attempt to know me as a person...I've become more of a professional psychological listener ( to use the word counsellor would be an exaggeration)
I am seriously fed up of his whining and complaining about the guys he wanted to be with but couldn't be because of his over the top levels of suspicion......afraid that his personal professional and social life would crumble down if he opened himself up to a wrong person....
Surely all the chaos must be taking a toll on him..
Daddy, I have my deepest sympathy towards you but if you just want a listener who would listen to you and your woes and your difficulties in finding a right guy.......the number of times you've betrayed your unsuspecting wife......I surely am not your cup of tea....or hot chocolate...;)
I would blame our closed society and our narrow minded government and its pinhole view of the lgbt community as the factors that lead many to live a life of betrayal....
It is also largely the fault of the weak minded who take the "safe" route and fail to be committed to it.....
My last words for you daddy.....take good care of mommy...</p>
<h1>GCIL- Next time you meet such sugar daddy, add one more thing. Daddy can you buy me a car?</h1>
