<p>The day before yesterday i met my best friends at my hometown after a couple of months. as i am living in Gujarat.
had a great nightout, smoked weed all night, we went to the jungle in the middle of the night. it was soo fun. but somewhere between i was feeling a bit uncomfortable with them when they started talking about girls, one friend showed me his girlfriend's pic n said 'dekh bhai, kaisi he ye? isko pataya' i said good! mahol chal raha tera to. this is the moment i suddenly realized that all of my friends are straight and i was the only one who is not. i remember that night i wished if i was not a bisexual. i was thinking about my sexual orientation. feeling weird,i don't know why i am feeling like i am loosing interest in guys, even i am not having any romantic relationship with a gurl. i think i should have a girlfriend. so even i can tell them that i have a girlfriend too. i am not jealous of them that they are having girlfriends. but whenever they begin talking about girls i remain quiet, cuz i don't have anything about girls to talk over. my friends tell me that how smart i am and says " bhai tu itta smart dikhta koi maal kyu ni patata? " i laugh and say "gurls jee ka janjaal hoti he, mujhe nhi samhal paegi gf" 
well, i don't like the feeling i am feeling about my sexual orientation. i love the way i am, i don't want no change in me. i hope this thing won't affect my great and pleasant friendship with my besties...!!</p>
