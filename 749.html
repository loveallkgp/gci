<p>Hi everyone. m 22 frm Pune.I want to give suggestion abt masterbeation(mb).first of all i want to clear that'purane khaylo wala guy'.i had habit of mb. Mb is very bad habit.it is said that as cream is in milk,as oil is in nuts,semen is in male body if we remove cream from milk,it vl not hav any value same for male if v remove semen again n again v vl face lots of body problemz in futre like power loss,infertility.it is said that 1 drop of semen is eqal to10 drops of blood.our body has to work hard to produce single drop of semen.it is essential fluid of our body it iz not wastage of our body.it is 'sar' of our body.u should store ur semen n see overall good effect on ur body in 3months (i hav experienced it).m not sayng dont mb,bt shld be as low as posbl(2/3time in month).n last bt nt least our culture iz really really gr8 dont get hypnotized by wastern culture</p>
<h1>Viv- Damn! Are you living in the 21st century? There were times when even free thinking was against the culture and even people's rights were subjugated in the name of religion. Whatever you described are totally wrong things. Masturbation(notice the spellings) is healthy for your body. If you store your semen for too long in your body you can have a condition called "blue balls". Masturbation is necessary for your prostate gland too. Rather than believing in hypothetical and imaginary things, do your research and then preach about it. You will only spread false news here if you go on like this. And do not even call it western culture. Its your own evolution that counts. Western culture ke naam ka saala hathiyaar bana ke andhere mein teer chalate rehte hain log.</h1>
