<p>Born in a orthodox christian family. I believe in God and have personally experienced the spiritual intervention,but my religion is against my sexual orientation. i read books,testimonies and many article about how people are proud of being gay or bi or what so ever. In my case i feel guilty and I disgust my self. I kept my self secluded from everyone ,confined myself with in the boundaries of my own guilt and fear. I am faking my own reality and living a lie. My reflection rejects me. Achieved many things so far  in life but never achieved the peace of mind, the joy of living or the chance of being my self. Tried making friends with LGBT ppl which turned out to be even more disturbingly horrific than facing any homophobic. Found only devils in disguise.</p>
<p>Life has become a compromise . Life has taken me for granted . No hope _ embracing this fact of life.  </p>
<h1>GCI- This time I will go for a new approach.</h1>
<p>1- It is said that the 'Bible' was written to discourage homosexual leanings &amp; NOT 'homosexuality' to be precise so as to save the society of moral loss.
2- Also to add that the book condemns heterosexual people on more than 300+ immoral grounds and less than ten grounds on homosexual leanings and NOT homosexuality itself.
3- The religion never decides our genes, genitals, gender and our persona then y do u look forward to any such faith which rejects the biological part and only focuses on the social or religious part?
4- NO faith teaches discrimination, unfaithfulness, or violence as the main pivotal points to prove its worth but in reality ALL the religions are guilty of practicing the very same facticity.
5- STOP looking for your worth and acceptance from faiths and beliefs, its your job to make the new ones as to How u want to perceive yourself!
6- Look for answers from all the realms of life and stop being the self-moral bitch, its of no fucking use.
7- WE are the same shittiest as other strt gay or bi folks, the scenario is the same honey and STOP comparing. Gays are not ANGELS OR DEMONS....they are fucking shitty stupid humans and they can be anything they want.
8- Peace of mind is NOT to be looked for, it is to be REALISED within OURSELVES.
9- U think world is wrong in pin pointing u gay as innately wrong, no my dear the world is never right or wrong on anything its only the fucking dominant theories of society that makes anything right or wrong.
10- Disintegrate your truths into urself and be self satiating, rest will follow automatically.</p>
