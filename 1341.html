<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    I let him go today. I met this guy two weeks ago. We shared our no. and pics and used to chat all day long. Last Sunday we planned to meet in CP. Only for me, came all the way from Noida to Rajiv Chowk. Inspite of being ill, he happily waited for almost a day for me. I had sent him a text that i wont be able to join him that day. Later, when he received my text, he calmly said &quot;its alright! but at least you would have informed me earlier. I love you nonaa...&quot; And i further asked if he had lunch. To my awe he said,&quot; Nona socha tha ki apko propose karke sath me khaenge hum&quot;. A teardrop flowed out from my left eye when i read this. And that day he reached around 10pm, all hungry, exhausted and unwell since 8am, obly for me... I apologised for not making it up and exclaimed that will surely heal it up all in the next meeting. In all this time, there had been numerous instances where he expressed his love amazingly. I loved him too with my all. Today, i told him that i cant be with you as i dont deserve you. I didnt tell him the reason. But he kept pleading and begging to keep me safe in his love. I love him too. But i haven&#39;t broken up with my ex. And today i feel the guilt and shame for juggling with two hearts. I sobbed really bad. Why did i do this? Why? Today i will let go off these two beauties of my life, not only because i ditched them, because i love them both and i want to be happy. They deserve much better things their way. I would not want to be a rag in their happiness. And so i told both of them last night. &#39;I can&#39;t be yours.&#39; Tried to explain with lame examples... A big sigh is all im left with. My conscience is killing me for what i did to them... I know im bad, really bad... i dont even deserve your forgiveness but still to say, &quot;Please forgive me...&quot; I will be alone for i know i can never be anybody&#39;s... To you guys out there, when you are already with someone, never take a chance be playful or flirty with a new guy. You might feel the pleasure but slowly you&#39;ll feel that you&#39;re being a player which might affect your relationship with them both.... Its human tendency to long for more and something better... but we forget in this thirst, that we already have enough to keep us alive... Bas tum dono itna kehna chahta hu, &#39;Tujhe jeena hai mere bina... ;(
