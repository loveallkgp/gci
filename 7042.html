<p>Hey all!</p>
<p>I am writing some really mind baffling issues which have started to house in my mind regarding the community problems which we are currently facing in our present day world. Well to start and be straight to the point I feel that LGBTQ in India is on crossroads where there are two ends- First one leads for the new generation to remain in the closet and Second one is making the life of OUT people difficult.
To simply put it into some major conclusions I would like to point to some of the concerned thoughts not being addressed properly till date. The very foremost issue is of Transphobia, second is of Biphobia, third is of the west now moving to the next level of sustaining rights and working on them and fourth is our sexual revolution still in the phase of fear and stigma!
My questions therefore are-
a- Where do we stand in terms of being gay??? Would we see top bottom shit more as a replica of heteronormativity?
b- Would we still let our social labels force to be on the safe side by 'straight acting' and being 'masculine' or tagging ourselves as 'Bisexual' to masquerade gay???
c- Are we still shitty enough to not understand that the world is moving with a fast pace in some part and slow in the other....How long should we hold the victim card and say we please spare us  because we are GAY??</p>
