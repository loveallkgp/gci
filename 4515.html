<p>I hve a crush on my college friend since college times. he is an year elder to me. The thing is he was loving a girl so deeply which obviously means he is not a gay.</p>
<p>So here is the issue: I told him after an year of frindship that i befreinded him coz he looks like a male angel ( courageous to speak this to a senior ), we had few bus travelings, dinner togethers, cafeterias, messages phone calls. so college over, now also we are friends. Might have told him LITERALLY 100 times that i love him so so much. gave him gifts, greeting cards, romantic messages ending with love you's, etc. He gave me chocolates on my demand ( assuming that he is thinking me as a bro kind f a guy )</p>
<p>what I dont know is whether he is Bi or not. for all my above said activities, his reactions are like a great killing smile, thank you, and somegood words, but not even ONCE he rejected my affection for him. i told him over phone yesterday that "even if you get married, even after 50 years I will come and say, you are mine to your grandson". He is completely cool with this. Is he Bi ?</p>
<p>My plan is I am taking him to a hill station for some lonely time with him and some little romance ( which I couldnt do in college ) and if possible a light sex. How do I know whether he ll be okay for all light romance and sex ? He said he is willing to come there along with me.
Obviously i dont want to ruin the divine friendship, so if he shows a slightest rejection or if he felt uncomfortable, i will defintely stop disturbing him.</p>
<p>But is he extremely, unbelievably, magically, THAT DUMB to understand all my intentions ? he seems to be a bit dumb in studies, but is he really so in this as well ? On top of this, an year back i wrote an unfinished erotic characterising him as the hero of it and i am moving over him for a foreplay, ( i sensored those erotic lines ) but he is still asking me to send the complete version of it. What to do ? how can i understand this dumb ? Will he be okay for a bromance and some mild sex, just as a sharing of love or he just makes me to feel comfortable though he doesnt really like it ? my god, my head is spinning. :(</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh please my head is spinning as well.</h1>
