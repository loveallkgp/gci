<p>Hi everyone in this group....Here's my confession...I got shifted to this new hostel in the beginning of my 3rd year at college. I was kinda upset coz I was used to my previous hostel and everything here seemed new.
I was allotted room in the 2nd floor at hostel with my 2 room mates. They'd been with me for last 2 years and i love them a lot, just as friends, and thank god for that coz it would have been much more difficult for me the other way round to stay with them.
There was another boys hostel in front of ours, which as perfectly visible from my room's window. Also was visible a spot where the water tank used to overflow and fall down and in this particular place boys used to come to bathe.
I was just awestruck when i first saw the view. My God, some of them were extremely hot. Actually, i believe that only those guys came there who were proud of their physique. And i was glad.
Time and again i used to check if anyone came there in morning. These guys just made my day.
One particular evening it was really hot and lights were out. Both of my roommates had gone some where. As usual, i checked out of window. And my mouth went open.
This extremely hot beefy guy was bathing there and was just de-licious. his boxers were sticking to his frontal. Sometimes he used to put his hands inside. This was way too much. He was a little hairy too, which was a cherry on top of the pie.
For the Finale, when he was done, he looked sideways to see if someone was there. then he turned around and pulled out his undies!!OMMG i cud clearly see his cute butt but eventually he vanished inside the darkness of bathroom and i was burning in hell.
As for now, i live in the same hostel but in a different room. Its really cosy and cool here, minus the scenic view from the window. I really miss that view...Please tell me what to do!!!!! :)</p>
<h1>Viv- I thought you saw your roommates kissing at that spot or doing other stuff... duhhhh... You killed the excitement. No suggestion for you!</h1>
