<p>I have recently started staying with a gay. Yesterday he took one guy home and said he was his boy friend. I said okay fine. One day he stayed in room. I was busy doing my things but that guy was like constantly bugging me. Kabhi yanha hath maro toh wanha then started asking you are top/bottom. I said none of your business. When room mate was in wash room he came to room and locked the room and said don't show off and was coming closer. I said i would have slapped at the first attempt itself, just because of my friend i am not saying anything, that doesn't mean i am not capable of anything. What do you think just being gay i need a big dick/tight hole, get a life. I mean what the hell. What an asshole. What do people think -gays are perverts, think of sex 24*7, can sleep with any guy with good assert?
Don't you think we somehow are responsible for creating these images for us. This is high time we should try to change it so that only the society will change attitude towards us.</p>
<h1>GCI- Exactly this type of thing happens in heterosexual community as well but no one points them as they already have their rights. So its not an issue with them. Indeed we are kinda responsible for having a perverted image. There are gay guys in the streets and parks hunting for other guys and straights. That sends out a bad message. It is a personal liberty that also can't be questioned. But the gay life also has another side which is full of compassion and love and the need to be accepted where some couples can live the way they want and can have a wonderful future and it does exist. We need to put out those stories so that people can come out of their old stereotypes.</h1>
