<p>hey everyone , male gay 22
i have been in a relationship for more than a year now . i'm really happy but there always those little hiccups . we both are from same college and lived together for a brief period of time . my mom , my sister most of my close friends know about us and are very supportive . well his family is bit uptight though i'm received well there and they are nice people but i'm scared hows it gonna be if they ever get to know the truth . 
anyhow in starting of my relationship my bf was a gr8 fan of grindr:D . even i branded him as a whore (jokingly) but we both have been off of it for quite a while . but sometimes we get in an argument about how i made him stop using it . he understands me tho that it looks like a foul play if a guy is committed and he is there . but i hate how kiddish he is . we go to clubs and trust me m just saying this thinking its a no judging zone that i get hit on way too much there as compared  to him, he is even jealous of my friends and then he fights with me over this stupid idea when he is being delusional that i ll leave him for someone else . everytime the bitch gets drunk its like man its gonna be an angry parade . Seriously my whole family knows , my friends know , you are the one who wants to seek so called "friends" on grindr and motherfucking bitch tries to blame me for hurting this relationship .
seriously needed to get it all out . </p>
