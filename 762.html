M a gay,m studying in 11 and m in luv with one of m classmate,he usually talks to me,,,,,...v both had received the same tuitions,,,,,,everything was going awesome until.....I told him that m in love with him......and fr that day he block me frm everywhere(fb,whatsapp,etc).I still luv him and always will,,,.!!!$ 
Plzzz give m some suggestions what do i do...plzzz help m..</p>
<p>$ABBY : he is straight guy .. move on . don't bother him or stalk him otherwise he will get irritated and spread the news that you are gay . get out of his way and never see his face . leave the tution ..focus on studies . its hard at your age to actually forgetting someone you like. but i have gone to this age and situation and i have the experience . rest is your choice ..if you want keep on loving him . its not called love when other person don't loves back .. its called ' one sided love' ...</p>
