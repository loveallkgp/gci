<p>Hey guys and the admin  Dude just wanna say something, I have a boyfriend, 2 years now. We decided to come out to parents as gay and my boyfriend said he would leave me if parents are not okay with it. I m just fucked up with it because come on how the fuck can he say it like that to my face? Ok leave that matter. Now in case of parents, dude what the hell, if our parents truly love us more than they care about the society, why the hell cant they accept their gay sons or lesbian daughters? Somehow i m sure that any of our parents might not be okay with it. I decided to run away with him if my Dad or mom opposes but he? Gosh damn i m fucked up like anything dude. And seriously Why does he have to be such a bitch that he just cant say it out to their face that he loves me?</p>
<h1>GCI- See popeye if u r sailing with a bisexual guy....98% is the chance that he will end up as 'bluto' with his 'olive'..</h1>
<p>NOW the case study-
1- If ur boyfriend is gay and self accepting and has a plan that includes U in his future plans then my dear u r going on the ryt path.
2- If both of u can come up with guts and alternatives to live life ur way and by the acceptance and permission of others....BINGO! u belled the cat!
3- If one of u cant stay without his parents then u will have to adjust in such a manner so that 'EK TEER SE DO NISHAANE' is accomplished!
4- If u have trust issues, loyalty issues, economic issues, future plan issues and career issues then sort them before going for a live in.</p>
<p>P.S- In case ur bf is bi..there are bi guys who wanna get settled with a guy but for that fight against the stupid law or be secretive as u can so that ur discreet life never gets exposed....(plan B never works for long btw)</p>
