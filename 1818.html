<p>i was standing at the railway station surrounding area to catch a sight of a gay person because i'm myself a homosexual . two policemen came and asked me why are you standing here at this time around 9 pm night. i said nothing just came for urination . i m going back. they became so desperate to know the truth  about me . i didnt tell that i m gay. i said no reason i just came here for urination . they spoke to my parents and told them your son is standing alone at the station premises . now my parents are asking me why did i go there ? i'm tired of my life. even police even know the truth that usually gays come at this place still keep on behaving rude , bad with us .</p>
<p>$ABBY : urination places are not where you find love but usually find 'sex hookups'. but i think that's your business ..</p>
<p>but again you are misunderstanding police officials . these days lots of criminal activities are happening rapes, drug dealing , kidnapping and other things. railway stations and bus stands are target for these type of criminals.  so police might have found your 'supicious' thats why they called your parents . as a matter of fact they didn't say anything relating to gays or any anti-gay stuff. its just you antcipating . they were just doing their job . :D</p>
