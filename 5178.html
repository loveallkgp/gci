<p>Hello everyone!
Well am an undergrad and 21 yrs old. My confession is that I m in love with a boy of age 15. I have nvr seen anyone more innocent and cute then him. He lives in my neighbourhood. I cherish to be with him and talk with. However we are very close to each other and have a very nice bonding. Sometimes I clear his doubts in maths and also play with him. But this side of me is not known to him. I m afraid that if I will try to tell him abt it... it might be possible that he would stop talking with me. But I can't resist myself from loving him more and more everyday.
Also he is quite young. Don't know what to do!! :( :( :(
Please help me out...</p>

<h1>GCI- Well I'd just say this that he is just 15, so don't do anything that can be emotionally traumatic for him and legally wrong for you. Know him before making any move and even if you want to do anything, just make sure that he feels the same way for you.</h1>
