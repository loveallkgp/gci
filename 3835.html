<p>Hello,
I'm a 19 years old gay guy from mumbai! After reading reading the comments and the advises here , I'm now pretty sure that all the guys out there are very well educated! 
Please help me . I don't want to be a gay! (No offense). I respect you guys and I never criticise our community but I want to be a straight person..  I cannot be a gay.! I know being a gay will not hinder me from achieving our goals but still.! Indeed I need help! HOW CAN I BECOME A STRAIGHT NORMAL MALE? 
Errrrhhh! What should I do? I cannot do sex with a male though I'm attracted towards them ! I want to live a normal life! And this thing I can't even share with anybody.. this is very unusual and abnormal where I stay. Please underatand . And even it is considered in Christianity and in Islam as the biggest sin! I'm left with no other option.
 Either I'll never marry and be a single throughout my life helping orphans or I will kill myself! </p>
<h1>GCI- Well buddy the answer is that you can't change yourself. Gay is way you are. You have to accept it. There is no option b. Being gay is equally normal to being straight. You just need to accept yourself and then you will feel okay.</h1>
<p>As far as religion is concerned, you can have your beliefs but for me if any religion takes out the liberty of someone, then there is something really wrong with it. The Holy books were never Godsend directly. They were written by humans(their personal views), people like you and me and that too back in the very early age who had a completely different thinking process than what we have now. If you want to evolve into something better or want to go by some rules that were written thousands and thousands of years ago, its upto you. But never think about suicide. Ever.</p>
