<p>Hiii to all and a big tight hug for the page admins
Well let me ask u a question are indian gay men are different then all other gay men in the world cuz they should be or they are changed,as Indians do they understand the value of stability in relationships,do they values the rules of a marriage or do they even believe in marriage cuz we are Indians u know dats how we were brought up ???
second thing i always believed that love marriages are far better than arranged marriage but NOW something has changed my mind..
Don't u people think dat Indian gay guys have totally lost the Indian charm like they are doing one night stands, dating guys with an intention of only "having" and "demanding" i mean dat u know many foreign girls think indian men are quite loyal they are the keepers they are givers not takers but all those things dat i read in in all confessions broke me from inside nowadays indian guys are totally after lust ,lust is breaking the relationship.
i was a person who believed love marriages are d true marriages but all dat instability and selfish behavior of people in love changed me
love has become soooo frustrating koi bhi ladka pyaar me demands karte thakta hi nahi
and i believe that ye sab keval gay relationships me hi ho raha hai straight relationship are still the same indian type,gay guys want sex they get it when they meet like minded guys this can't happen in straight relationships
compromise,sacrifice,adjustment,unconditional love jesi cheez to extinct ho gayi hai 
So i wish ki ek din India me gay marriages legal ho well accepted ho or arranged gay marriages bhi ho so like gay relationships bhi zindagi bhar ke liye ho u know hum apne parents ko dekhte hai to we know no matter wat happens they love each other in every condition dats may not be a love marriage but it is Much more successful 
i know it is laughable but ye mera dream hai ki gay arranged marriage reality ban jaye</p>
<p>---by a guy who is extremely frustrated by todays dating system for gay relationships</p>
<h1>GCI : first of all gays are same everywhere ..just basic cultural difference which makes us bit different . and sex isn't bad and don't expect everyone to be same. there is variety... pizza , burgur , noodles all are different . some want relationship only ,.... some will enjoy sex with many then have a relationship , some don't find it attractive to be with same person whole life . so everyone is free .</h1>
<p>and indian marriges are laughable. here women are beaten by their close minded husbands , women are going throuh domestic violence , after marriage all the doors are closed ..she is supposd to be slave of her husband and her in laws for the rest of her life . </p>
<p>indian marriages are crap. i don't really believe you need a fake tradition to live with the person you want . go to court register your marriage ... that's it .</p>
<p>and darling if you want a change , be the change . 
i am sure there are many people here who have thinking same as you .. go date them and tell me if it worked .</p>
