<p>I am 27 yr old. I feel scared to talk to people due to deep rooted inferiority complex. I was badly bullied all school and college life. Even my parents used to call me a shame bcoz i was thin and shy and love my elder brother. So I never had a close friend or love or sex. I feel lot of panic when trying to talk to someone. Like having a heart attack. I dont want to visit psychiatrist since im scared my gay truth will come out. I dont know why God made me. I dont have looks money friends or any talent like driving or painting. I dont drink smoke or do drugs. I go to work on a deskjob, come back and watch tv. Day after day year after year. I have never done anything fun or wild. I spend all b'days and festivals alone. No one knows I exist except my boss and my parents. And they mostly ignore me. Its like being a zombie or in coma. I don't know if I am happy or sad bcoz I dont know what happiness feels like.</p>
<h1>GCI- Dear u made me emotional....don't worry first of all...just know some main hardcore facts-</h1>
<p>1- Ur strength are ur weaknesses..how??? have you ever thought that ur strength lies in the fact that u have actually achieved peace in ur life..not many can do that.
2- Have u ever thought that whatever u think of as talents are nothing but special traits...u r one of those who admire them..if everyone had that whom would the admirers praise???
3- U say u r weak...a shame...and a zombie....have u ever tried to work on ur shortcomings....??? asking for help is the biggest sign of strength bcoz u actually admire urself and love urself and that impelled u to ask for a helping hand!
4- U don't need to fit in the norms...for ur body make it look more attractive by workout....for ur mind...read inspiring good books like THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE...for ur soul..meditate daily...for ur sexual health..masturbate according to ur health and have a good sex mate...(if possible).
JUST PROMISE TO URSELF THAT U WONT GIVE UP UNTIL U DIE...
5- Visiting a psychiatrist has nothing to do with ur sexuality..IPS( indian psychiatric society) has delisted homosexuality to be a disease...they r supportive and ur case should be kept confidential according to the norms if u want to..U must go if u feel so.
6- Don't connect each and everything with ur sexuality..thats plain stupidity...IF u wanna associate then associate humour...kindness...self love and humanity with urself...that will count more. </p>
<p>GB honey...bless urself with positivity! G-luck!</p>
