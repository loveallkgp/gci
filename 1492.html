<p>I'm sharing my today story of just half hour ago. We had a bitter fight on whatsapp. Actually the reason is he is continuously online there but don't start chat by his own either not respond till I provoke something thrill. Even he use his alias fb account but that didn't bothered me. When I ask him why he don't reply he says coll friends are online and I understand him but they don't. When I said I also need time of him, he started saying I always hurt him and don't believe him. God knows what's the truth. Also now phone chat is minimized reason he is at home and in daytime hospital. My heart is paining too much. I begged him apology also if I hurt him. He didn't replied. Plz. Help admin.</p>
<h1>Viv- As crazy as it may sound, he is over you and his feelings for you. He is trying to make you appear like a scapegoat. Which is what you are exactly doing. Solution? You decrease the contacts too. Sab apne aap theek ho jayega.</h1>
