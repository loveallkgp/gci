<p>My bf gets horny very easily, although he ask me to have sex but i just don't want to. I always fantasize loosing my virginity romantically. Nys he is always horny and even tries to have sex me while im sleeping. This behaviour is very disturbing and i think that he might be having sex other than me. Should i enquire about him? The real reason i don't want to have sex is that he had sex with so many people and i don't know what disease he might have. But he is very good from heart and lively person.</p>

<h1>GCI- This "might" that you have in your head, if you let it grow you will regret it if he is true to you. And as far as the fear that you have for STDs, why don't you both get checked up at the hospital to make sure?</h1>
