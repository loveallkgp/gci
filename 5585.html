<p>One thing that just keeps on buggin me:
If I (ever) decide on having kids, will I do justice to them? I mean won't I be doing injustice to the kid by stripping his/her rights to have a mother and all? It just confuses me a lot. Sure, I will love the kid like everything for he/she shall be a beautiful part of my life, my existence. But then again, will my love leave something lacking in the kids development?
.
One thing that I take satisfaction from at times is that - it would b better of me to adopt a child from an orphanage (if I could) that to surrogate a baby. I don't want a child of my own sperm. There r already lots of child that r not provided with proper care, why not I provide them better care by adopting...but again the same thing pops up in my mind - will I b able to do justice?</p>
<h1>GCI- There are single dads and single mothers. It's not like everyone is privileged enough to have both gender parents.</h1>
<p>Let me tell you one thing though. Scientific researches has proved gay couples can play the role of both parents. But you really said one beautiful thought. Adopting a child and providing him/her with better care is one of the best thing that I know. Even I had the same dream ever since I was in my 8th standard. </p>
<p>You will do justice. I guess the feeling of live is enough.</p>
