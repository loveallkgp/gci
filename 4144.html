<p>All of us want our right but the fact is most of the people belonging to our parents/grandparents generation think otherwise and its them who make the rules and regulations and the laws of the country there are liberal minded people in our generation who accept us as who we are but it might take 15-20 years for them to reach a level to get our rights/remove 377.</p>
<p>Its feels like we are not free the country gained freedom in 1947 and 67 years later and we are still not free. I have seen LGBT people doing pride parade all over the country but what good does it do. Nothing, I say.</p>
<p>and now a link to a nice song about the freedom struggle of Black People in America
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHmUPqI6w9g</p>
<p>In a country where at every single moment people had to fight for their freedom I think its about time we took matters in our own hand and gain the rights that we truly deserve. We could follow the path of Gandhi Ji or Anna Hazare and build a protest outside Supreme Court or the Parliament. We could go on fast till death in front on the Parliament until our basic Human Rights are given to us.</p>
<p>I'm just a common shy person and I'm not in a position to start an act on my own and so I request LGBT orgnizations to at least think about this idea coz I believe this is one thing that can get us freedom within few years.</p>
