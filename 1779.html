<p>Em an 18 year guy..
Its Not kinda confession.. Nor its a complain.. Its jus some random thought that crosses my mind every now and then...
At times.. I wish..I go and hug sumone very tightly.. I wish.. I could share myself.. All me.. to that person.. Sometimes. I wish I too Had a love stoRy.. I don't ask for a perfect relation with no fights ... I want a relation Where I cud be me.. But then I ponder.. Its just a WISH.. which would never come true.. Coz when I see around.. think.. Em interested in galsz.. but not sexually.. Nd even if I Go for a relation. with a girl.. I wud b feeling empty.. I wud be feeling still unsatisified.. Coz at the End may be... I ..I need a guy.. Coz yes! Em gAy..!!.. I wish for a guy to b mine.. I wish I too had that guy Lover.. who gonna love me unconditionally for what ever I am.. accepting me in whatever way I am.. But then.. looking over here.. I jus conclude... I have to be alone forever.. Since here.. Guyz are not..um.. they Just want Physical satisfications.. Physical attractions.. Have a Good face.. n u have hoards of fans!!.. No one is ever true.. howsoever.. they say they are... And then..I have to say to myself. Life is like this. God had given u this life like this only.. Noone can be urs.. Neither a Guy..nor a Girl.. But in The deepest corner of my HeaRt I still wish..Someone proves me wrong...!
Thanks for reading till the end..;)</p>
<h1>Viv- Hey, I like girls to but as long as they are not flirting with me in a dirty way I'm totally fine with them. That doesn't makes me go in a relationship with them. But I feeling like awwww-ing at your confession. You will be proved wrong one day. One of my friend was also having these kind of thoughts and I said, "Just stop searching. Your guy will come to you automatically." And he accepted that and he couldn't be happier now because he got someone he deserve. So just enjoy your life as the way it is for the moment.</h1>
