<p>This is dev Singh here .... </p>
<p>First of all .... My comments have got nothing to do with anybody's comments . And my comments are never personally offensive ... and hence no asshole have rights to lick my fucking cum out of my dick without me shagging it on their face ...  which mean you have no damn rights to comment on me personally
Second .... If XYZs  are so brilliant and are born genius then better write down your own thoughts in your own way . Don't be a big time loosers commenting over somebody else's thoughts and calling them dumb .... if you have brain then there is also something what you call typographical mistakes ....third .... I don't comment to gain anybody's god damn attention .. because I have a bf who respects me and adorns me pretty well so . I don't give a fuck either you like my comments or not ... and guys have your own shity thought .. if you don't have your own thoughts then don't comment on others ..</p>
<p>$ABBY : if somebody has problem with his comments on page they can simply ignore it . everyone has right to give their view .</p>
