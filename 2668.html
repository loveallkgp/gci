<h1>GCI- It is not mandatory for every bi guy to get married to a girl even if they are in a relation with a guy. Maybe your bf can turn out to be sane and maybe you both can live together. You definitely cannot say that he will settle with a girl. You are being mature, I know and you are thinking right that if you see no future why to carry on a certain fling? But that's not always a case. Maybe you can make an exception. There are a lot of maybe's here. But at the end what matters is the maturity level of your bf right now and how will it change in the coming future. That you know better so act accordingly.</h1>
