<p>first of all explain the total situation which includes both side.you explained your side only . well I'M THE UNCLE you were talking about. I'm 30 and I'm not uncle. kiddo you better learn manners.. will you confess the PR thing ?</p>
<p>ah leave it boy, I'll do that.
i talked to this guy on PR. first day of chating we were quite good at converse. we know each other in virtual world from 2 weeks or so.
as days passed and one day he said something to me that made me to think about this guy. he said he's in problems and need money for his course fee and running out of money and also can't ask it from parents as from middle class background with weak financial status. i told him I'll help him but we have to see each other , we should know each other then only. he backed away from then.. and the same thing he told to one my friend also that even 6 months ago.</p>
<p>after that we weren't in contact. and suddenly he saw me at bus stand and threw a swear words on me including itna paisa hote huwe itna kanjus kyu karte he log.. he was showing his body language as a call girl. i didnt expected this guy to be girlish! lol.</p>
<p>yeah I'm matured and i shouldn't have pushed him but if i didnt do that.. he would cross the limits. so better speak truth. :)</p>
