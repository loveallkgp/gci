<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    bonjour ! it is not much of a confession. (i know it is ironic)
    this goes for men who are &quot;gay&quot;.

    We all know that at the end of the day we are finding/hoping to find/dreaming to find a partner/soulmate;
    we also know that the pages like &quot;Gay Sex Chat&quot; &quot;Rajouri Garden/Tilak Nagar Gays&quot; and the likes will not help us find that (at times i pity them NO OFFENCE.)

    But then somewhere deep down, we hope that there would be some guy who would send you a text or comment on your post and the rest will be history and then i think
    i am using an alias account (not using the word fake coz i have my profile picture up and some thing real written in the bio and it is y way of standing out.)
    If i am using this account how shld i expect the other person to get real after all we live in a virtual world.

    and just a pointer today&#39;s kids know what they want at least i do, be able to talk about other subjects as well like novels, movies, food, hot men xD

    and i would like to point out that would it kill men to go out on a classic date ? i mean c&#39;mon i admit i am not a most romantic person (i am decent in case you are reading this ) but one does not want some humping sessions just one nice date would be fine, lunch, talks, a few laughs and a small goodbye kiss at the end. (that went out of hand.)

    And hey dnt loose hope you will find your lovestory i wish it could start in a restaurant or somewhere in a metro (it sounds cliche)

    and dnt keep your hopes up and dnt fall for what everyone pens down and you would know when mr. right walks by ur door &#39;coz it&#39;d be different. (honestly, it is not different at all heck ! i failed to notice the last time, Alas ! let bygones be bygones.)

    This guy i.e. moi, is just learning to accept that &quot;we be awesome&quot; and str8 dudes are boring ! and yeah well nothing beats checking out guys with your best friend xD

    to much to expect ?

    Thnx for reading this and wasting your time
    Thnx Admin for posting thiis. (if it gets posted)

    #firstConfession well sorta ?!

    Au revoir.
