<p>I have confessed here before
I was in a relationship or friendship with a guy for one year !!
And its been more than one year we have seperated
He left the city and break d relation too
He said he dont want to be a gay anymore
He is a bottom bisexualy n me a  bisexual top
According to him he dont meet any guy n i believe him
He hv gf too der now
When we were into relation we were so much into each other emotionally as well as physically
But now he dont hv emotions for me n also we dont hv physical relation
We r still frnds
Do talk sometimes n meet in one or two months
But the problem is i still love him
I hv feelings for him
If i say all this to him he got irritated he dont want to be with a man anymore</p>
<p>I want to know is it possible that a guy who was so much sexually into a man can comletely leave this part of his life
Is it possible from gay to complete into straight phase</p>
<p>Bcoz may be he do dates guys but i dont understand ki kaise pta lgaun bcoz mujhe bhi yhi lgta h ki wo nhi date krta hoga kisi ladke ko</p>
<p>I do think of getting him back
N also j dont want to loose his friendship
Atleast we r friends
I dont understand what should i do to get him back.</p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmm...Do u know ur post is fucked up at so many places which makes we wonder where to start from.</h1>
<p>Anyway here goes our answer-
1- NO..Its not an on-off switch...sexuality is considered more fluid these days...no one become anything in terms of their orientation and sexuality.
2- Why on earth u want him to be back in ur life?? I mean r u that much emotionally handicapped that u can't bear the thought of being with urself and with those whom u can grow?
3- Fuck your one year and fuck ur love story coz it ain't one and stop wasting ur time, energy, money and emotions on something which is gonna be like Sisyphus.
 4- LET HIM LIVE HIS LIFE.....I REPEAT!!!</p>
<p>P.S- People please can we learn something better than to bug someone in their private life and show our true pathetic intrusive 'Indianness' for which we have gained a bad image!</p>
