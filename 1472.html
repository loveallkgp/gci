I met a guy through a social networkng site.. he was quite gd,well mannered, well out spoken,well maintained looks.. whenever we meet, was the best time I had.. even he proposed me n I said yes
we had a gd time for 2 months</p>
<p>bt suddenly he stopped being responsive..
I mean jab tak Uska office timings the he replied bt after 7 or 8 he stopped repling..
after so many fights regarding this I came to know that HE WAS MARRIED ..
n just because his wife was there he unable to reply ..
I knew he loves me alot ..
bt his married life n work pressure pissed me off.
I waited for 6 months to make the things happen again..

<h1>Viv- Of course you did right. If he hid the fact from you the you did really great by breaking up. Honestly, who can't remain loyal to his wife, can't remain loyal to you.</h1>
