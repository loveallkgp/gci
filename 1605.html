<p>hey.. I have a doubt Mr.Admin! I am 20 yr old and confused about my sexual orientation. When I see pretty and fair girls, i get attracted towards them. I have even fallen for few of them. My first crush was a girl. :) I imagine myself being with that girl in every walk of my life and wish tat she should take care of me like how a girl looks after her favourite puppy; caring, hugging and likewise. But I never dreamt of having sex with her. Contrastingly, when I see well built or cute boys I will be starring at them. I feel like being friends with them. At few times, I even think of sharing my bed with them ( ..for.. obvious..). I havent had sex with either gal or boy yet. So i am confused about my identity? Am I pure GAY? or BI ? What does pure 100% gay mean? Will gay people never fall for a girl at any instance ? Pls help me. </p>
<h1>Viv- You really dont have to be confused about your orientation. Being gay means that you get attracted sexually, romantically and emotionally to the person of the same sex. If I say about myself I'm gay and girls don't interest me whatsoever. You case is like you have romantic feelings for girls but you are sexually attracted towards boys. You are a bisexual. Now I can write to much more but it will only be an overhead transmission for you. To be sure about yourself you have to take a step to try everything with both genders and then choose what you like more.</h1>
<p>Although what my gut feeling says is that you are gay but your denial is keeping you away from acceptance. And lastly, all of those things like caring, hugging and likewise stuff can be done with a right guy partner. Its not limited to girls only. Sometimes gay guys have more nakhras than girls.</p>
