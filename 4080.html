<p>hello admin
I am a feminist. A delhi girl who enjoys her life in netro, who speaks near fluent english in metro and tells people to buy me candies. well whatever, I just wanna say to you that you people must stop. I think there are more important issues than LGBT rights. women get raped everyday, we want more stricter laws for them. You people plese stop for now because we want our woman rights first. Women discrimination is problem since so many centuries, yours just started in british era. So please! plus does it matter? you gay can do sex whenever you want, face it! That's the truth! Even after indian law restricts such sexual contacts, you people still do sex! It's because of men like you and all over the world ,al we get is discrimination. Because of you girls feel insecure to have relationship with man abd then they turn lesbians plus other girls feel so so much intimidated that they have no choice but to be masculine and get another gender and become transgender so they can be man or feel like manly. Plus I've seen so many gays who just become gay because they didn't get a girl. So just for sexual purpose they use boys. That's the reality! face ir admin! face it! That's why gay and male bisexual rights can be passed later on. First we need rights for straight women (like me), lesbian, bisexual and transgenders. You gay and busexual can wait for another 10 or 50 years. plus, admin you have the citizenship of canadas land. You are in a gay friendly country, so stop for 10 years. As you know, I'm a very popular girl but I live in metro (except nightime when it's closed) to see that there's no one who's messing with women. If they do so , I just punch on their face and get the preperators arrested. Plus I am also in charge of fulfilling female desires. You filthy man have shaped entertainment policies in accordance with your own intrests. I make sure that there are not only naked woman on TV but also handsome and charming man. I also try to organize kpop concerts (which recently happened in delhi) because korean man are 300% more handsome than filty indian men. Because of filthy indian man , our nation is now called as 'rapistan' by foreigners. So stop admin, stop it! If you care for nation's woman and reputation.
Now about me, I am staright woman but I am a feminist and I protect all women and transgeneders. Except gay and male bisexuals because they are man and man never asks fir somebody's protection and help. I've majored in english literature and currently preparing to settle in china for my studies in chinese literature (even in Bejeing, I'll protect chinese women). So admin, In next april I'll be in china. I want you to atleast stop. Don't protest anymore for gay and male bisexual rights.
As hang teo zen once said -
'gays and bisexuals are composed of strong men who need no laws, no protection because they are man and man have wild sexual desires. No matter what you do to restrict them, they'll do sex and resist every barrier like a straight male would do once he get hungry for sex. That's why we have no option but to change laws which allow them sexual freedom but only do so after women are given more rights than men. "
And now about me-
When I'll go to china, Iam planning to get a chinese husband and settle in china but I'll come to india every month for few days so I can conduct mass nationwide protests against government which is filled with filthy indian men who don't want to give rights to women citizens.

<h1>GCI- Umm are you sure you did your masters in English Literature? Because it never seemed like that. Anyways, for most of the part I thought you were a troll and this confession is nothing but a child's essay who is already agitated beyond means.</h1>
<p>But for those PSEUDO-FEMINISTS out there and for the people who have ideologies like depicted in this confession-
1) No one becomes gay.
2) Gay guys do not rape women.
3) Its not because of us that girls feel insecure and then turn lesbian. Its is natural and lesbians are by birth.
4) Gay guys are the supporters of women rights as well if you could care enough to see because all of us are sexually oppressed.</p>
<p>I don't know what you are trying to say in this confession but certainly you want your priorities sorted. </p>
<p>Moreover, its the girls like you who always think that they are always right. These days girls like you are using their power of pseudo feminism to torture guys and sometimes because of your thinking, you cannot distinguish between a wrong guy and the right guy. You think all guys, including gays are bad. Many times the good guys have to suffer uselessly just because there are stupid girls like you.</p>
<p>Atlast, do go away to china, that will be a good riddance. We need sane people in India. Have a happy life there and do not come back. </p>
<p>Vaddi aayi kudiya da theka len wali. Gall kiti nai jaundi te chaudhraani bani firdi aa.</p>
<p>PS- I do not have Canadian citizenship. I am here on a study visa. Also, its people like you who fuel our will power to fight for our rights. So thank you for telling me that we are on a right course because we do fight against stupid stereotypes, which your confession is a classic example. :)</p>
