<p>I am lonely gay. Neither able to find any gay in my surroundings nor able to find best friend to support me :( So I am addicted to this # Gay India Confessions page. My Day begins here and ends here. I am the biggest, craziest follower of this page. I push away my loneliness by reading confessions and related comments . But i need to mention one point here. This page is both a boon and bane for lonely gays like me. Boon in sense tat it helps me to be stronger and sensible by reading valuable advices for confessions. Bane in sense tat it provokes me to have a boy friend 4 myself asap by reading love and romantic confessions. Frankly, not being jealous but I bit get emotional and depressed sometimes for me being unlucky 4 not experiencing any gay love after reading successful love confessions and at the same tym I try to come out of tat depressions by reading supportive advices given by admins for suffering gays . My love for dis page is increasing day by day ; And u both admins are real strength. real voice, real gurus, real caretakers of our community. :) I have confessed here many a times and i do have got overwhelming responses for my confessions. I dont know whether i wil get my partner or not , but i strongly believe tat my permanent life partner, my love of my life is none other than this page #Gay India Confessions. I was highly emotional type and self destructive type;Before joining dis page i had left hopes of surviving on this earth. But dis page brought me courage, teached me to face d world, showed me not to be self destructive, made me to love myself for wat I am, stood with me 24*7 and supported me in every walk of my life. :) I am thankful to all supporters of this page. :) Love u both admins for making this happen atleast for a lonely gay like me so tat i get an opportunity to survive and breath for a while . :) :) I am greatful and i really owe u both #HUGS :)
With lots of LOVE ,</p>
<h1>Me d Confessor</h1>
<h1>Viv- Wow! Just amazing! Thanks love for appreciating the work. I never really knew that our efforts(admins and members alike) will be having such a direct effect on someone's life. Stay well honey, and be proud of who you are. Just do not minimize yourself to the page always. To get your love you have to socialize and that cannot happen if you are here 24x7.</h1>
<p>But anyways, its kind of refreshing for me personally to read such stuff just to keep writing more for you guys. We guys always have your backs. Keep on spreading love, munchkins.</p>
