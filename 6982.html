<p>Hey Admin! umm i forgot what my last confession's no. Was? The one which was about me fighting with cancer.But anyway i came back once again here just to thanks all the commentators who wished me good luck and wished for me long life. Thankyou guys for your wishes and prayers , i recently underwent a big cancer surgery and luckily the doctor is amused himself he consider it as a miracle though.. Sayin that cell has suddenly stopped mitosis and there are very much chances of me living again, i had actually left all hope for living but now i wanna live and im damn sure i will live... and Luckily those antidepressants helped me a lot in moving on gradually of my ex.. But i still think of you my tiny miny,, and it's ur b'day next month on 14th i won't be able to wish though neither would see you or could celebrate it like last year,, but still you are in my prayers everyday... and, i also want to thank you AAYAN MEHRA, you really cheered me up and built my confidence again... Thankyou so much for being there though you have deactivated your account now and i couldn't even meet you for the last time.. Indeed you are an awesome friend,,, looking forward for a happy life again... :) with lots of ups and downs... and you still are my hero tiny miny though we won't be together again thanks to you too Admin :)</p>
<h1>GCI- Love u aayaan my boy...I never knew people can be such inspirations for others.</h1>
<p>Confessor dear all our best wishes shall always be with you! Gluck with ur life and live now coz life is happening NOW!</p>
