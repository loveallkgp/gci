<h1>GCI- Bonjor Monseiur! You are too much addicted to him and you are emotionally involved. As it is a 3 year and 3 months relation, you are bound to care for him. But at the same time you should not let it cloud your head. Whatever you are meant to do in life, you have to do it whether you feel boring or have something else in your mind. Don't make those decisions which you will regret in your life like "It is because of this relation I wasn't able to do the task." Don't let your feelings grow to that.</h1>
