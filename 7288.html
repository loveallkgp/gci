<p>I saw the much awaited movie- Aligarh. What a movie. Incredible direction and lajawab acting by Manoj Bajpayee. Its not merely abt being gay or abt homosexuality. Its more abt humanity...I guess. How cud u film a person while having intimate moments with his partner..without his concent. That was a sting operation. I just hate this word. Those fucktards sud not be spared. But what concerned me more. At last the protagonist a 64 yrs single professor wins a case yet he thinks to go and settle down in america. That line gave me goosebumps. His own people are after him..that he doesn't even wants to stay in his motherland. A question has been raised...</p>

<p>How are you gonna justify the sexuality of a person to be dangerous and contagious when that very person has been amongst u for several years without a harm?</p>
