<h1>GCI- Do you have any option other than coming out or getting marriage? Of course running away and living somewhere else will be way too much dramatic. You can always say that you feel happy only with each other and you will ruin your life if you take the wrong decision to get married with a girl. Love is not supposed to be the weakness. It can be your strength too. Just be confident upon yourself and your love. You both have what many seek. Don't let it go away.</h1>
