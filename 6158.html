<p>Hi people
I am 18 and a stranger to you all . Maybe my story is a bit offbit or it can be relatable( tats pretty relative from people to people) but I am bisexual with a sexual inclination to boys more and am proud of it . But the only thing is I am still inside my closet . But do I get bothered by it ? Nah !! Not at all . I love being in my closet coz I feel that there isn't any need to be so emotional about coming out to people considering the confessions of going through hard times of accepting ones sexuality . Well I have embraced myself and I think that  for me there isn't any need to go on telling people that I luv attention from both the genders . Lyk a straight person wudnt necessarily come out to people saying ' hey I like girls ' . Because believe it or not we always find it detaching ourselves from the society .  If we find that what we are is normal then there is no fuss of thinking bad about oneself for not coming out . Just be the way you are . I am not at all emotional of the fact that I wudnt ever come out . I might someday . But I never ever see myself moaning of the fact that I couldn't come out to people , in 10 years down the line coz being bisexual is very normal to me 
But different people do have different perceptions and I do respect everyone's ideas . Please don't judge me of this fact neither m I spreading the fact to be in closet , whoever wants to must but whoever that cudnt should go through tough times. It's just what's me and I don't make a deal of my sexual orientation neither do I have any doubts about it .</p>
