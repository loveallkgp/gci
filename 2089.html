<p>So I have this friend of mine . He tries to get touchy with me. When he meets me anywhere , his hand will go down my spine and he'll start rubbing. Oh! I hate this so much. He tries to hold my hand, tries to hug me almost everytime we meet. I have told him that I don't like all this behaviour. I have asked him if he is gay. He just brushes that off. And then one day, he comes to me. I was doing some work and he whispers in my ear that I want to kiss you. I didn't say a word. I just smiled and smiled with a frown on my face. I started ignoring him but there seems no end to his seducing touches. I want to end this all, even though I've confronted him about this many times. Even if I stop talking to him, he just forces himself on me</p>
