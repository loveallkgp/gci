<h1>GCI- You already know the answer to that. He had sex with you even though you never wanted it in the first place. From the looks of it, he faked loved to get sex and then told you that it will not work and he will get married in future and that you should do it too. The main thing here is about you. If you cannot be best friends with him after you both get married in future, then leave him. Leave him anyway though. He seems like a player. You will be happy without him.</h1>
