<p>Hi guys..
There's this great friend of mine at college. He's my room-mate too. we've joined our two single beds to make one double bed. I am attracted towards him..a lot! Whenever we sleep, we cuddle up and hug each other and sleep. As far as I know, he's straight. But some recent activities has put me in doubt. It's been a few weeks now, while sleeping, he slides his hand inside my t-shirt and caresses my belly and my chest area and also plays with my nipples. I do the same and it feels so good. He gets a hard on , which is easily visible.. but he never lets me touch it. What should I do? I'm really confused!!! I really wana make love to him and at the same time I don't want to ruin our friendship by making a wrong move.</p>
<p>plz help!</p>
<h1>GCI- Let me tell you what will happen. Most probably when you both will be excited beyond the limits one night, some things will happen. You will get close physically. Then you will continue it until one day he will feel bad start ignoring you and you will become depressed. In the meantime you will sprout feelings for him and each moment that you live, you will feel suffocated. That's the most possible scenario that I have told you.</h1>
