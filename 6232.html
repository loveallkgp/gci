<p>hi all
pls dont scold/curse me after reading the confession!
Admin bhai, tu bhi !!
My best friend is straight (he says, and i agree to it). He looks good, but to me he his very handsome and hot. Now the problem is though m mature enough to understand all the differences between us, and though I know that it is not going to happen, I always dream about getting fucked by him !! yes! very bad may be, but as they say love is blind, probably m more attracted to him emotionally that i wana get the physical relationship done as well. I prefer to be the bot. M normal having big butt, tight hole tongue emoticon hes thin, taller than me, having a big thick dick ( i hav seen the bulges ). How perfect our things are for a fuck tongue emoticon still . . it doesn't seem to happen.
No m not seducing him, I do understand that after all he is my friend . . I dont think it will happen ever. Wish somehow this cud happen.
As far as this confession is concerned, m just sharing my thoughts with you all, coz I cannot do so with him.</p>
<h1>GCI- Should I bang my head after reading this or should i call the moral police of the page members here?</h1>
