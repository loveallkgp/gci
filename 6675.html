<p>I have no idea how it works....Its not a cofession but I want to tell someone bout my feelings n probably some suggestions....
Anyhow, 9 months back, I moved to Switzerland from India to do PhD. I never met a decent guy in my life... All guys whom I met, wanted to go to bed on our first meeting n I also went with them... I wanted a boyfriend but never got one....
After I moved here I met an european guy on PR. He insisted me to meet him (For some reason I did not want to)....After some time of chatting, we decide to meet near a bridge..... He was sweet (not so handsome but me neither).....He told me that he recently broke up from a long relationship and still not able to moved on properly.....
After that he asked me out again....n it was beautiful.....we started to go out.....n then suddenly he stopped because he had some problem with his ex again.....
After few weeks I went for a vacation and he msgd me that he wanted to start over again....The day I came back, he cooked dinner for me n we had sex for first time.........Next few weeks I was in heaven..... We used to plan together, cook together, did our HIV test together......
Suddenly He mailed me one day that he cant get over his ex and he felt that he is betraying me......he wanted to stop to contact me......
At this point I already fall for him......After a week of drinking n crying i cant stop myself and mailed him........
He replied and he met me n told me that he is emotional wreak ri8 now so we cant get involved . He told me that we can meet but not to expect more than that....
After few days he stopped meeting me....he stopped to reply my msg n used to only reply me on mail.... N now he also stopped that.....
I have no idea what went wrong.......I never wanted to meet him at first and now when I start to love him, start to belief that there is true love n nice guys in gay world, he just thrown me out....It hurts so much that I have no idea how to be ok again..... 
I am seeing other guys again but when I meet someone, I just cant concentrate......His voice keeps on echoing in my head.....
I tried to hate him but cant find a single thing that I can hate......Only thing which is haunting me   that why he did this with me????
I do not know I can ever love someone again.......or I can believe someone again.........</p>
<h1>GCI- Try to put yourself in his shoes. Like you feel for him, he feels for someone. He was in a relationship with someone else and that is hard to forget. You have feelings for him and yet it if you try to be with a third completely different person, you cannot do it. It won't be right for you.</h1>
<p>But at the same time it was kinda wrong on his part that he used you for a rebound. Maybe we cannot call it a rebound, but it was wrong of him to go out with you, develop expectations in you when he couldn't carry it on himself. Leave him to his own thoughts for sometime, and I wish you all the best. It won't be easy for you but it will pass. It always passes.</p>
