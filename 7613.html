<p>Hello everyone,  i am here to share something and want to know abt wht i cn do. Its bit long, but please hv a look,. Might be you can suggest something good. </p>
<p>So i hv a bf(fiance)  and he is married already. We both mutually took the decision to continue. So abt past,  1 and half year before,  whn he got a perfect job and was earning good, his parents forced him fr marriage as he is nly child. He hd to agree due to lots of reasons. He was not having anyone wth him at tht tym. He hd gone frm a breakup also at tht tym. So after lot of pressure and emotional tools by His parents. They made him to do marriage. But he was nt hvng good married lyf still he tried alot to made her wife happy. Took her to various destinations, restaurants, buyed presents. Loved her, pampered her. Evry possible thngs tht he can do.but he was nt happy. After we met, we got so attached. We started falling in love. And now after 7 months, we are at the moment at wch we cnt stay without talking to each other. We meet daily. And its our necessity. And  Now thngss strted become worse. Due to problems in married lyf, he got depressed.  And last week finally he gt out from closet in front of his father and then whole family. In starting they tried to understand the situation but then they started taking appointment from some stupid doctors who are claiming that they will make him fyn and will change his orientation etc etc. And now my guy is really stressed. His family is trying to settle everything and asking him fr a baby. And he made a decision to finally file fr a divorce. As its nt easy thng. Girl's father  is advocate and he can tk any bad step. And his wife is saying she will nt leave him so easily and 'mai tumhe badnam karke chodungi'  etc etc.  We both are so worried and still so positive.  He is constantly trying to make me believe that i am not the reason fr all this. And i really want ki sab sahi ho jaye as i can't see him in this condition. We are together, i am trying to make him stong. I am supporting  him alot so tht wo depression me na jaaye. We are just hoping fr the best. So this is our story. Thanks alot fr gvng ur tym, I really  want some suggestions.  I am waiting.</p>
<h1>GCI- First of all, it's no ones fault. It's the fault of the ignorance of the people around the both of you.</h1>
<p>Second, ask your bf to collect evidence. Record the wordings of his wife that would prove to be as the potential threat to him in the future.</p>
<p>Third, take help from a legal LGBT lawyer. Lawyers collective is one organization. Do not hesitate to take a firm step when required.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as family if they can't even support you or understand you. I know it's not their fault that they don't know about it, but when it is required to support the kids, that's when your true parenting skills come in. </p>
<p>Do whatever is right, do whatever for yourself. If you both need a one on one session, do come in the inbox. I will be glad to help you guys out.</p>
