<p>There is a openly gay in my office. He sits alone for lunch and in bus. No one really talks to him except work stuff and make jokes behind his back. He seems so sad all the time I feel sorry. I was also a effeminate gay who was bullied in school and college. Kids used to pull my pants in public asking do you have dick? My dad used to hit me all the time if I did any girly stuff. So i vowed never to act effeminate through mind control. I am scared to talk to this guy. People will suspect I'm gay and my reputation built through so much struggle will be ruined. I cannot face all that again just to help this guy. I wish he would just disappear so I don't have to relive my past everyday</p>
<h1>GCI- SLAP on ur bloody face and ur bloody hypocrisy which u have mastered over the entire shitty life u have lived..... Its because of people like u that people who are out of the closet go back into or commit suicide...because LODUS AND CHUTIYAES like u think u have gained something great and garnered respect....LET ME MIRROR UR SHITTY REALITY.....</h1>
<p>1- U have become more sick than the people who are already sick of homophobia.
2- People like u think that achieving the parameters of patriarchy gives u the CARD OF RESPECTABILITY.....well, if that is so then do that with coming OUT as gay and still practising ur acquired trait of masculinity..U will understand that how much more hypocrite u have become than the bloody society now.
3- Homophobes thrive on two main things---OUR IGNORANCE AND OUR INTERNAL HOMOPHOBIA...what r u infected with, between these two?
4- If U think that ur so called respect will be ruined if u mingle with him as human being..trust me U HAVE NO SELF RESPECT AT ALL....
5- Being decent is NOT equal to being manly....and if u think that u did so much of 'mind control' then do one more thing..SHOO UR GAY PART OF U AWAY...u won't be needing any more advice then.
6- Do him a favour, find him a job at a better place if u want UR SO CALLED REPUTATION to be sustained by u, because if u have not given him his right of earning and livelihood u HAVE NO RIGHT TO WISH HIM DISAPPEAR.</p>
<p>N.B- If I ever come across this kind of posts in the future...I would be insulting the related person to the core and dare anyone force out people to live like this or 'wish them disappear' or adding to the woes of the community like this...I SHALL BE A LIVING WRATH to them...its a warning!</p>
