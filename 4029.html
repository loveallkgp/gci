<p>There was a man of the age of around 40-50 i guess, who tried to follow me whenever he saw me. And when he got a chance to get close to me he used to utter words forcing me to go for sex with him.Once he got to grab my dick in a market place and forced me to go to a lonely place. I was damn scared because at that time i didn't have any idea about gays.However, forgiveness prevailed and my fear gradually banished when i came to learn about homosexuality. But what aroused my anger was when i came to know that this man used to walk around in the same market place and tried to seduce every innocent guy when he gets a chance.Anger made me to find out his residence and even his full identity and yes i could figure out some facts about him. He stays not so far from that market place and he is very active in church.Everybody respects him for being religious, he earns his livelihood by selling vegetables in the market. I came to know that one day this same man was trying to follow a guy in the parking lot and since the guy was scared and could'nt do anything to make him go away and so he asked for help from the people around. When the people tried to enquire about the reason why he followed that guy, his replied was that this man came and buy vegetables from my shops two weeks ago and didn't pay for it and so i was just trying to get the money that he should pay.After his cunning reply he just fled away from the spot.I use to think that this ugly old man is not just a normal gay. He is a criminal and tries to victimize innocent guys including those who know nothing about homosexuality. Whenever i see him, my anger goes up.He deserves punishment. In church he is an important one but in the market place he is a demon.I planned of reporting this to the local NGOs but the fact that keeps me away from doing that is because even me i'm gay.However, a single remembrance of this man irritates my mind a lot.I use to see him walking freely with no shame in the market place. He is a threat to the society but no one knows about his action because he is very cunning. I know there were several guys who were his victims but all remain voiceless because he used to do this to the innocent and voiceless brethren just like me who are too scared to bring him to justice.I know there will be a lot more who will be his victims if no one tries to fight back against him. My confession might not be so interesting due to lack of skill to express it in a proper way,but i really mean it and i really need your proper suggestions as to what should i do to bring him to justice. I respect gays coz i'm gay myself but he is different. He is a criminal who forcefully tries to seduce every innocent guy.He deserves punishment but in what way.Please suggest.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well if you are so passionate to get him some "justice", I'd say make a video clip of him and then report him to an NGO. He might be doing some serious child abuse and you many never know about it what goes on in his home.</h1>
