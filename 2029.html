<p>I find it strange most of the time when people who are finding LOVE asks for position (t/v/b). They say they would do anything for their love, they say they would even die for them. I'm confused.
If two tops falls in love, wouldn't both of them be ready to play as bottom for just thier special mate? Wouldn't it feel nice to both, especially to the one who would b topping?
I think yes they would.
So, when these guys asks for true love with their position, are they just seeking sex or they are genuine?
If they are genuine then I guess they are stereotypes. I guess when they say top they mean someone dominant, 'male-type' and when they say bottom they mean inferior guys, girlish or ppl like that..</p>

<h1>GCI- That's what people think that being active is dominant and being passive is submissive. There have been multiple divisions in the world already. Do we need anymore? People who say they are strictly top, I say to them, "Loose your ego and live a little." :)</h1>
