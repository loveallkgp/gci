<p>Hello guys . . . Medical student here  . . .doing my gerenal medicine from russia . . . Basically from delhi and age 21 . . . today . . I wanna share my thinking about my life or life of a gay . . And may be sometime related to straight also bt not all . .  . . most of time I do think about me .  . . .My life..  about my gay life  . . .my aims . . . my last day on this earth . .. . sometimes I said to myself let it be yaar . . . Jo hoga dekha jayga bt in night before sleep many questions of such Type make me a miserable and vulnerable person . . I feel so exhausted . . Bt by this deep thinking I start to know more and more about life and here  I have some positive point also of being gay, which provide me relief so have a look on them:-
1. We gays can adopt many homeless children . . .and give them a name and a life.
2.as we have no tension or responsibility of wife and family we can concentrate more on our aims ,works. 
3. We can do anything whatever we want . . We can go anywhere  . . .  Where we wanna go.
But when I think about my old age . . . I really retrieve depression . . Is I really alone on my last day . . .. is on that day nobody will care me . . . . .what Will I think on that day . .for whom I lived on this earth . .  . . . These things make me to kill myself now . . .today . . Just At this moment . . .what I get if I live 20 more years more . .. or 50 year more .  . .I saw  many old people . . . And they were straight   they have family . . Still they are waiting for death and  their family members also hoping everyday their death . . Is this a life??  . . . I ask my pakistani teacher . .  he have readed whole quran . . .i asked him what quran says  . .why god give this life to us. . .he said just to workship . . . And be muslim . . . Kher ye mera topic nhi .. .and I am not satisfied by his answer . . so guys what you wanna say to me . . . 
kuch faltu na bole . .jise sun kr koi hurt ho .. .Thanks</p>
<h1>GCI- U are talking  about endless possibilities here...Ok lemme put it another way....</h1>
<p>1- What if your strt friend marries someone and that girl dies after some years?Will he stop living???
2- What if you end up with good people in your life and actually have a very caring partner??
3- What if your life takes you to  a place where you yourself would love to be alone?
4- Old age is a privilege ..not many can get there...what are your plans for old age??To sulk or to live again??
5- What if your 20 years of living are just a total waste of time and emotions even if you marry?
7- Your Pakistani teacher needs to go into the khyber pass region to practice renunciation...HAIL ALLAH!
8- Y are u overthinking if you even don't know that you may actually be alive tomorrow or not??
9- Lastly think only those stuff which make your soul grow..Nothing else is required! PERIOD!</p>
