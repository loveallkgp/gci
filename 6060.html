<p>Dear all,
It was a usual cam-sex session between me and him, but what followed was very unusual.we had a romantic talk,which continued for several days.we exchanged numbers, n thn I came to know he is from Pakistan.
We talked day and night on whatsapp, sent each other voice messages, family pics, childhood pics, fav. Songs,almost everything.we didn't have sex or even sexual talk after that day.he had 28 partners previously.I accept him with that.
I was victim of sexual abuse.he accepts me with that.
I dont expect him to be loyal.
We both accept each other as we are, with our religions and nationality.
He sends me aayat of quran, I send him sholks of geeta.
I know this is virtual...I know its not real, I know it will end one day,
But till that day, let me enjoy...let me feel depth of love, comfort of acceptance, warmth of feelings.......I do n I will love him as much as I can till that day....
I love you NK....:) you are best thing ever happened to me.</p>
<h1>GCI- A love story that already has a sad ending? You are not the first of your kind. Maybe you both could try to be with each other and not let things fall apart to the circumstances? Love is too beautiful to be constrained.</h1>
