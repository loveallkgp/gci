<p>why gays are so obsessed with their sexuality? i meant , i have seen many gays being shattered , sad, broken jusr bcoz they don't have true love,partner and all.. common guys.. you too have a life. sexuality is not the only things to move ahead in life. just see straight guys.. they like girls but still they're not obsessed with girls, they are not sad bcoz they are single.. i can see many confessions in this page also related to this. and some gays are toh boht hi jyada obsession hote . as if gay partner nhi h toh life hi nhi chalegi. -_- . first career then partner.</p>
<h1>GCI- Sometimes its not about partner. It is about coming to terms with the sexuality. People take some time to become comfortable after a lot of internal struggle and that counts a lot. For straight people it is clear. Relationships are everyone's personal issues and it's theirs to deal with. Yes, career does comes first indeed. The only thing people want is the means of communication with someone like minded and I don't think that it is too much to make a fuss about. Once you are okay with yourself, you can leave the topic of sexuality aside and focus on other things. But when there is a struggle going on, it does bother a lot.</h1>
