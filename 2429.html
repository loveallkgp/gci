<p>Of late i have met a guy through fb..... We shared our numbers and chatted in Whatsapp.... he said that he liked me and that he wanted to fall for me.... Its Strange.....though i like him but he hardly gets time to message me....He is in a job and sometimes reacts to my messages in such a way as if he is forcefully replying me.... Now he wants to meet me.... I asked him to meet me in a mall near my house.... but he said the place would be too far... so he proposed another place so that we can meet there.....However, I don't know what to do!!! I hardly know him... Aesey mey ussey milna thik hoga ya nahi samajh nahi aa raha..... He is not interested in Sex which i explored while talking to him which is the best part....but still i Fear.....I hope u understand.... kindly help me out!!!! </p>
<h1>GCI- I don't think that it is that big of a problem if he is meeting you at some public place. He is a busy guy but still he is taking time out for meeting you. Do not feel anything like excited or scared. Remain calm when you meet him and just talk about each other. Meeting in person would be good than texting on whatsapp.</h1>
