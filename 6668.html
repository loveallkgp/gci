<p>hi all...im 24 years old from Gaya, bihar.</p>
<p>people say gays are born that way. yes , this might be totally correct. but not in all cases.
and so i have a doubt.
when i was around 6-7 years old. i was sexually molested by my one uncle.
that time i was not even aware of what he was doing and why he was doing!</p>
<p>he used to touch my parts and do oral on me. and no anal.
this happened around 25 to 30 times over the span of next 6 years. and so last time he did this to me was when i was around 12 years old.</p>
<p>after that, he got a job in delhi and now i rarely see him.</p>
<p>now, i know what he did was very wrong. he should not have done this with a child.  i feel much angry whenever i think of this .. but now i hav forgiven him.</p>
<p>the thing here  is i realised that i was a gay when i was in my 8th std (i was 14 years old).
even though by this time, my uncle had already stopped molesting me and was not even around me...i now used to think of guys doing the same to me. i gradually felt the attraction towards men.
first i used to fantasize in the same way the things my uncle used to do on me.</p>
<p>and then this attraction eventually increased years after year. </p>
<p>now i dont have a doubt that i m a gay or not. coz im a gay. and i do have attraction to only guys. now i also have a boyfriend who loves me a lot &amp; so do i . he is of my age only.</p>
<p>but when i look to my past..the time when i was in the "phase".the time when our hormones are changing..i think the "environmental factor(sexually molested by that uncle)" must have had impact on me. something mentally.</p>
<p>i dont know if im wrong or right to say that.</p>
<p>sometimes i think maybe i was born a gay ..and this whole thing was just a "bad coincidence"..and nothing more.</p>
<p>but i do still will always have this doubt that i was not a gay. (not that i regret now being a gay..im proud to be who i am).</p>
<p>and during the stage when our hormones are changing, i got attarcted to guys because of the "same sex acts" my uncle did on me. and this increased my sexual feelings for guys. and made me sexually like guys and not girls.
i would like to read your views on this. 
and yes i again repeat ..today im proud to be who i am. its just that i want to know more about me. the things that define me.
thankyou for reading.</p>
<h1>GCI- Child molestation leaves psychological scars and not turns someone gay or Bi. To some extent those people get comfortable with the idea of non binary sexual thing and Kudos to you for writing sense(much needed on this page for a few).</h1>
