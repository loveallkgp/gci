<p>Hello. What gets me in writing this is the inner me who is craving to come out of this horrible situation m in. Like its been suffocating since i have realised about my sexuality and took efforts to accept it but all in vain. What adds to it is my immense one sided love towards a straight friend which i am not able get over. I am helpless and donno what to do. Need your kind guidance folks.
Thank you!</p>
<h1>GCI- Read articles of those people who have accepted themselves. There are online accounts of them of what they have been through about their inner struggles. That can always help you out. And as far as that one sided love is considered, darling one day when you are out of it and you'd look back, you'd say, "Damn, I was so stupid back then." So save the present yourself the humiliation from your future yourself.</h1>
