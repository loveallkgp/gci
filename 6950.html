<p>Namaste to all :) Happy Navratras ! I am Mohit ..... a 16 year old gay guy ! And I posted pehle bhi ...about the issue of my sister pressurizing me to tell my "secret" to her .....and adminji said don't tell her anything ! So I decided I won't ...... But that day dopahar me I fell asleep and she called many times and I didn't pick so she came to my pg with her best friend ..(she is my best friend too now toh :p ) and she was almost crying coz she thought I am angry ! And I couldn't see that so I sent her out for two minutes and stayed with her best friend (i felt she is more open minded ) and she got me calm down and then asked ki I can tell her anything ! And I asked her ki pehle bata if I look not so normal from angle ....she said nai tu bohot accha hai and u r fine ! Then I asked have you seen some show named MTV yariyaan ? She said yup ! Then I asked do u remember a character named Kabir ......and she smiled ! And I was like o Teri ye samajh gayi ! :p and she hugged me and said paagal ittu si baat me piche itna suspense create kiya ......and she said you are my friend and will always be ! And ab toh we r even better friends ! And phir she called my sister in (I did not tell her pehle coz I thought wo kya sochegi and I couldn't afford losing her ! ) and then nishi (friend ) said to ani (my sister ) ki woi baat thi Jo apan ne kal Sochi thi ! And ani ne mujhe thappad maara and said Bandar ! Faltu ka tension de rha tha ! Phir I started wid my Rona dhona ! And then we 3 hugged ! And then danced and did patties party and had dher saari masti ! :) I am so lucky to have angels like Mansi ani nishi and Vidhi (I told her ki m gay just yesterday and she gave same reaction )  in my life :) .......So m abhi 16 to shayad aap kaho ki Maine duniya nhi dekhi but itna to ab smjhta hun ki life fairy tale nhi hoti .....koi bhi ho gay ya straight ya bisexual sabko life me issues hain ......but ham khush rehna chahte hain to ham rahenge ! Har haal me :) I too have faced many chutiyas (like Akshat ....who made my life hell ) kaafi aansu bahaye hain ...... But ab nai ! Arre aap gay ho ....maa paa ko batane se darte ho ! Be positive jab tak nhi btaate ! Aivai cheezein assume kyun karna .....mere papa will throw me out of the house .....I know somewhere but phir bhi I have this feeling ki I will hug him and cry it out and things will be good ! So sablog be happy love all hate none ! And ......DO ALWAYS LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR HEART SAYS ! ALWAYS ! sounds impractical but is really FRUITFUL ! :)  and by the way ......my present status is ...... I love life ! Exchanging diaries filling up slambooks doing kitty party like thingies ! Gossiping and commenting on fashion sense of people at the shopping mall ! :p discussing shows of channel v and all that ! Doing "amateur dramas " all those "girly" or say "gay" things ....... And with that converting at least one frown to smile everyday ! And sharing my candies with everybody (I have looootsss of varieties :p ) .........I think I am now living in a fairy tale ! :)</p>
