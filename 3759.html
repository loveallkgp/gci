<p>Hey guys! 
Huh.. I am in love with a guy younger than me .. I like him since years and I know i can do nothing.. I'd read many confession on this page regarding that" its not worthy to fall for a straight guy .. u will end up in sadness.!".. huh but I think I'm a gay for him.! He knows that I'm a gay he supports me as well but.. but he is straight. . I think I'm a gay for him.. and if he cannot be my partner I'll surely migarate to any of the country which is very well sophisticated instead of staying here in conservative India. .! At least in such places I will b able to wear clothes which I like ..! If he cannot spend his life with m I'll surely stay single forever bcus I cannot find anyone like him! And I personally think that all the people here on fb are sex seekers and are not my type.!
Love u all the lgbt out there.!
Kudos to u admin u r doing a very good job.! Huh </p>
<h1>GCI : :) i wished you mentioned your age .</h1>
<p>you know a str8 guy can't really move in with another guy to start a family ( no matter if that guy loves him more than anyone) and its completely kiddish to expect somebody to love us just because we feel love for them . </p>
<p>its good that you are planning to move some place which is more open . but don't come to conclusion ' that you will stay single forever' .. 5 years back i wanted to do same for a str8 guy but now i am like .. no i should also have a happy life  , i should feel the touch of man i love , i want to feel the coziness of relationship ...  i want to feel loved . wanted . </p>
<p>so i would advise for some time try to forget him and then move on to fulfill your dreams . and don't get bitter get wiser . accept the truth .</p>
