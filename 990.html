<h1>tell me</h1>
<p>i had a brk up and now my ex loves me again but i dont want to be with him again (cz v broke for a reasn) and now i am #single. Today i told him ( still v r frnx) that em ready to marry a girl (em bisex.) and he called me a #characterless_hoe :-O even tho em virgin cz v vr in LDR
so wanna knw viv n all, who em i? Is it wrong to move on in life. Cz according to him hvng physical relation with a girl or a boy (in case i come out) is being characterless hoe -_-
i knw he will read this post so i want you to make him undrstant coz he believe wat others say!</p>
<h1>Viv- Well if you broke for a reason make him understand that why you and him together are not possible. But don't say that you are bi so that you could get married and thats why you broke up. Then I will be the biggest judgmental hoe. It is not wrong to move on. Infact it is healthy. You move on to much better things. So ask your bf to find someone more worthy, in a manner of speaking.</h1>
