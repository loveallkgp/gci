<p>Hi there!
Like others, same story i have.
I am from punjab.I am in a relationship since last 4 months. We met only once on june 18th. After dat i went to jaipur for internship. We used to talk on fone and chat smtimes..everythng was good,but since last two weeks, m feeling ignorance. He says dat he is busy but i dnt get him.. He works in a restaurant in Amritsar. He sleeps in d day do night shifts as he said. So m busy in d day, and at dat time he sleeps. Still i feel atleast he shud call once , even i call alot of times but he didnt answer.most irritating thing is i see him online on his fake account smtimes. I have also asked him dat if he loves sm1 else den he can tell me, i dnt hav any issue. But he says he loves only me. And now day after 2mrw m returning back home from jaipur.finally m done wid my internship. M a hotelier. I seriously love him so much. But sometimes i feel i shud leave him bt m nt able to do so. He hates me/He loves me, god knows!!</p>
