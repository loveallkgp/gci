<h1>Viv- You know buddy, I kind of felt bad that somewhere my joke was hurtful and I was actually gonna come and apologize. But not now. The kind of prejudice that you brought in the first line about "girly gay type" makes me to smack your face. You are the one who is coward. And you are the typical kind of person who will prove all the stereotypes about gays which are held by homophobic people. Why must you be a gay and discriminate against effeminate gays? They are way better than double faced cowards like you because they have guts to be themselves. So keep on living in closet while I will still be a free gay man able to make my own decisions. You can now have a walk of shame.</h1>
