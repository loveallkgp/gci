<p>hey frndzzz
i knw a guy, he is kinda feminine in gesture plzz i m not saying tht being feminine is being gay, but my internal mind give me a feel tht he is gay or some hw he must be interested in boys only... he looks so cute, with lovely beautiful smile... nd while i watch him, he gives just nice smile, even though i hv meet him few times only, my mind says he is gay ... but cant decide it.... but cant make a move to ask him like this.... suggest wht can i do...</p>
<h1>GCI- Why don't you have a conversation with him about LGBT and say that you had a friend, not long ago, who came out to you and tell him that you are okay with it. Notice his reaction. He might feel that you are okay with all of it and might trust you with it if he is gay.</h1>
<p>You must always give people a reason to trust you. You cannot force it out of them. Give him some time.</p>
