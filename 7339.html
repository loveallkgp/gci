<p>I am 22 yr old bisexual. During my college days i had crush on two girls but later i fell in love with a guy who is straight. He is a gud person kind hearted, he is my close friend too. But during our final exams he came to my home to study and that night when he was sleeping i hold his penis, he suddenly got up and got frustreted. From that night he was not talking to me properly like he use to talk. I accepted my mistake and told him i will not do such things in future. After that we opted for same course and we use to go together for lectures, after two years after waiting for him to forgive me i decided to tell him my feelings for him and i told but after teling everything he got shocked, frustrated and said "dont talk such rubbish things ur are my friend so be loke a friend". He was and he is my first priority in everything. Now i am with him as a friend as he wanted me to be but many times my feelings get so strong that its hard to control. Recently he got girlfriend, i cant express my feelings to him now. It is 7 years i have same feeling for him, never felt for anyone else. Tel me what to do?</p>
<h1>GCI- Go away from him. For 7 years you have yourself on the hook for him. I can never put the blame on him because he was honest about his interest and sexuality. You are better off with the people of your sexuality anyway.</h1>
