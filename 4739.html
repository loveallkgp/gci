<p>Dear YOU,
You will never change another person.
The only thing YOU can do is walk away.
Walk away with the knowledge that YOU
were good. Walk away with the
knowledge that YOU were true. Walk
away with the knowledge that YOU gave
it your all. When we keep giving chances
over and over thinking someone will be
different or change, we get disappointed.
Not in them, but in ourselves for falling
for something again. When someone
betrays us, it's not about us, but about
them. It isn't up to you to show them
how wrong they were or how good you
are or what a mistake they made. They
will figure that out down the line. I
know its hard, but you just walk away
with the wisdom to know that you are
everything you should be and everything
God has made perfectly.
We are defined by how we rise after we
fall; not by WHAT made us fall.
Love,
Me</p>
