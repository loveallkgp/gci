<p>Hey friends, </p>
<p>This is not a confession. I need a suggestion. There's a old man who works near my college. He is very poor. His son has just completed 12th and got good marks. My friends and I have helped him in giving entrance exams. He cleared that and now he's getting admission. But his father is not able to pay his fees. We all friends have collected some funds. But still we are short wid some amount. </p>
<p>I want your suggestion friends that what should I do.</p>
<p>And if anyone can help plz leave a comment. And I'll reply. </p>
<h1>GCI : see its a very good deed you guys are doing . i would suggest that you people should talk to your college or school principle or any responsible faculty about it so that they can collect money from whole school which will help . see a college fee today is so much .. i suggest that the poor guy should go to government college instead of private college .</h1>
<p>you people shall ask for ' samaj sevi sanstha ' or any other ngo who could help this guy for further studies . not every person  can afford charity ... or maybe contact with some minister .</p>
