<p>I am a 23 yr old closet case. I had a crush on my friend since college days but I thought he was straight. So didnt propose him. But when last year there was 377 discussion, he said openly it should be removed. A pure straight wont openly support gays. So I then had a doubt if he was gay. Maybe he talks about girls and dating them just to hide hes gay. I have never heard him insult gays. He also wears pink tshirt sometimes and I see him secretly crying in sad movies. But when we sit together he never tried to touch or kiss me. I checked his phone and laptop but only found straight porn and apps. Maybe he has hidden gay porn. I am confused what to do. Should I try to have sex with him.</p>
<h1>GCI- Sit on a chair with your feet in your hands and make a baby pose because you are not mature and you have to grow up. Just because a guy cries, he support gays, wear some particular color shirt, doesn't make him gay. A STRAIGHT GUY CAN BE EMOTIONAL AND CAN SUPPORT GAYS TOO. Do not over think useless stuff.</h1>
