<p>Hi admin. I am a open gay boy. One of my friends once told me he curious about gay sex so i did it with him. He was very nice and handsome. We then slowly became couple. But recently he's blaming me for turning him gay and destroying his life. He fights a lot and beats me for every small reason. He even says things like hope I had died before meeting him. But I love him and also feel guilty for turning him gay, so I accept it and daily apologize. He then agrees not to dump me. Last week he hit my face with beer bottle for asking to stop drinking too much. I needed stitches above eyebrow. He hasn't called me since then and just sent a msg saying hope u learnt lesson and will behave in future. I  don't know what else to do to make him stop.</p>
<h1>GCI- Stop being in an abusive relationship. He is ending your confidence, hurting you, and treating you like a slave. All of this for not accepting his true identity and making you a scapegoat for the reality.</h1>
<p>Dump his ass to the ground, walk away and let him rot. You will have nothing to loose anyway.</p>
