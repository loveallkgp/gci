<p>Hey admin..it is great that you are helping many people through this page no matter how big or small...at this moment we( lgbt) really need to be strong ,united and fight against the injustice happening to us...so I would like you to progress further in overcoming the hurdles that each n every lgbt faces on day to day....in future if possible let's form organisation with real people and educate the ignorant people spread the love....I was just wondering since this page is growing fast I m sure many lgbt will agree to come together move ahead further. .other we will stay in the closet n stagnant forever.</p>
<h1>GCI : that's what my motto was ... when i thought of making this page . i wanted to educate people on what gay   is all about , what lesbianism is all about , who are trans people , who are bi sexuals ?.i wanted that people shall get to know what type of life struggles we (lgbt) go through ..when it comes to finding love , live freely  and how hard they make it for us to come out closet , to love ....</h1>
<p>plus organisations are already there . ... all we need is to get all india gays come togeather ..plus other thing was i wanted to give people courage to come out, to show there real id ... it will make easy for us to find people  for love .</p>
