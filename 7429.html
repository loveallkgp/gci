<p>Okay so we Have almost everyone complaining that they cannot find true love and that we are not acceptable in this society. Agreed, but has anybody realised that in this world, even the so called 'normal' people actually couple, have and are facing so much problems or u can  say obstructions is in their love stiries. You can see almost every film or serial or even real life stories. Isn't it? Then y are there bunch of immature guys here always complaining we are Being treated like aliens. Hnm bolo?</p>
<h1>GCIL- There brother....U said the bitter truth...thank god am spared coz  as being admin, if I had asked or put this question then I would have definitely been tagged as harsh and cruel and all the mayhem would have landed on to the comments section as mardi gras for me.</h1>
