<p>He was my crush during college years, but never happened that we could talk and be friends with. We just smiled at each other. Almost a decade later, I found him on WeChat. This app allows you to talk to strangers anonymously if you wish to. I approach my crush, and put forth my desire for him. To my surprise, he was open to experiment with me although he was married with kids. We met for a movie, and then had sex. It was only oral that I did on him. He said he was moving to Dubai, and bid me farewell. I sobbed and sobbed. Later, I saw him walking on the road. I sent him many texts. After a gap, we got back to our normal talks.</p>
<p>I was not subtle at all with him. I openly expressed my desire for him. He neither reciprocated nor refused. He met me on my birthday two weeks back, had dinner, and then he came over to my place. I did oral sex on him. Good part was he himself offered his body to me, and said that it was my birthday present. Oh! I was happy.</p>
<p>Last week, he asked me if we can go for movie. We went this past Saturday. I wanted to be naughty and flirty with him. After intermission, I slowly moved my hands to his thighs, and then to his cock. It was quite a subtle play. He was calm, neither resisted nor reciprocated. After some time, he got up from his seat and said he would be back. I thought he went to the loo. SHOCKINGLY, he didn't come back at all. I was devastated. Later that night, he replied to my text messages stating that he didn't like what I did, and asked me not to contact him. He blocked on WhatsApp and FB too. :(</p>
<p>I don't want to justify my action but for sure I wouldn't be doing this with a casual friend or anybody else so daringly. I could dare to do that because we have almost been like lovers in our chats and previous interactions. Now, I am not sure how to save the day! I am so depressed about all this drama.</p>
<p>NOTE: He mostly used to put away meeting me. Also, it was almost like a given that I was expected to spend for anything that we do together.</p>
<h1>GCI- Do not put the blame on yourself all alone. He was equally involved. It was consensual between the two of you and then he walked away saying that he didn't like it? That was an all time low of him. To start with you, you knew that he was married even though he was your crush. Imagine that you are in a relation with a guy, purest of pure relation, how would you feel if someone else tries his luck on your guy? But in this situation both you were equally wrong.</h1>
