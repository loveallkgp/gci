<p>hi Guys I am a gay and iam very fat. i have joined gym many a times, but in gym i find it very hard to control my feelings when i sexy guys.It makes me very uncomfortable.Sometimes ppl also come to know , when i stare at them . Wht should i do, as iam very unhealthy and fat and should join gym to control my weight?</p>
<h1>GCI : i train at home . not for the same reason but not to get inferiority complex from guys who are muscular . as i have just started making muscles i decided  i will go to gym once i have developed enough muscles to lift heavy weights .</h1>
<p>and about weight loss i think nobody needs gym for that . ( personal thinking ). you need running and exercising and aerobics which you can do in nature and at home . buy dumbles  to lift at home. go every morning and evening outside for running . </p>
<p>outside is better then gym . believe me . do cycling as much as possible. gym is for bodybuilders and fitness models . and is waste of lot money .. one cannot just spend 2 or 3 or whole life in gyms .</p>
