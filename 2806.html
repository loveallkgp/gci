<p>admn im a big fan of yours, no offence but your suggestions kinda really really rude this days. no doupt your suggestions are true and and right, always been. but the thing is that innocent and naive people comes to you to get your help you might wana be little gentle with your response. no hard feelings. now i know that u might be also having your own personal issues and problems but think about it, you created this page to help people aint it? So please dont mind my language just thought maybe id tell. other than you are the best</p>
<h1>GCI- Noted but also know that sometimes sugar coated solutions don't work. A hard reality check is sometimes required. Now, that depends upon the listener in what way to take the suggestion. If he has ego issues, we are targeted as rude people if not, then he can accept it in a good way. At the end of the day, who is to be benefited? Not us but the confessor. A coin has two sides, right?</h1>
