<p>Hello all, m a 20 years old guy doing MBBS. M tall, good looking guy. My confession is... When I was 7,8 years old, I was sexually abused by my tenant. After him , I did sex with many straight guys in very young age n all were 20-25 years old. Slowly slowly my feelings for sexy,hot guys changed. Now I like hunks more than chicks. But being a single son of parents n this fuc#@* society , I always have to control my feelings. I always have to pretend like a straight guy n due to this I have a girlfriend too who loves me a lot. I don't wanna hurt her. I have many other female frns too who always try to have relationship with me. M sick of all this crap. Don't know what to do. Kab tak ese do zindagi jeeta rahunga. I can't explore myself in front of anyone. Have so much pressure. </p>
