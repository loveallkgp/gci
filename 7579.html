<p>confessor of #7569... hi guys... hope you all are good.. this week was tiring to say the least...  we had a class test , reminders of the future class tests and all those NSS activities..... phew...<br>
anyways, today we had the ambar intro seminar.. and as expected it was attended by very few people.. mostly 2nd and 3rd year and 3-4 first years (me included)... all in all not more than 30...
but the seminar was very good..
they screened a queer themed movie and had a small interactive quiz...  also a few people shared their experiences of coming out and other lgbt related talks...
but the best part is.. i  made a friend  ... he hails from  UP....  and while on our way to our hostel , we talked about each other and i revealed my bisexuality and he revealed his homosexuality to me.... thank god that i finally found someone who can relate to me.... 
and about my experience of staying in a boys hostel..
well you get to see a few sexy guys shirtless.... <em>wink</em>  <em>drool</em>  hehe. :p
a guy who stays just opposite my room (god he looks so hot)
has become a very good friend...
oh i wish he was gay or bi...  :p
thats it guys..... i will share more about my life as a bisexual guy with you all... love u admins..... bye..</p>
