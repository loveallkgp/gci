<p>hey admin bro!!
can u tell me does gay relationship work long lasts??
actually i love one guy and he knows it, but we are like bestfriend!!</p>
<p>he dint bcme my bf coz of distance, but still he was good n so caring to me!, but now he has got his bf n now he is totally changed forcefully coz of his bf, his bf says to him dont share  anything with me, dont talk to much with me.. :( n he follows his commands, i need him as before!! its okay not being bf but atleast as bestfren!! :( thats why i m wishing to hear the break up news of his soon!!</p>
<p>$ABBY : excuse me ...... just coz u got bf doesn't mean u call me ' bro ' ...... :P  ( lol just kidding )</p>
<p>see as he had no choice he moved on and had a guy in life . its true u gotta tell a person about you motives ... nobody is going to stick around you just coz you like them ..... everyone wants to know the name of realtionship and how much they matter in ur life . as now he is in relation he is doing right thing as he gotta make his relationship work and gotta care about his bf's feelings . so u don't become third person .</p>
