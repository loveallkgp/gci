<p>Hello Admin and Members..</p>
<p>Admin , remembered me? :p 
improved my English with help of your responses to confessions!  XD . haha .</p>
<p>Few days ago i went to my cousin's place and stayed there for a week. we stay very close to each other like 15kms far from my house even though we rarely meet up.we enjoyed alot. but his company made me to doubt on him( don't say im kamina XD) </p>
<p>actually he was just talking about getting sucked by anyone even by kinnars.  I checked out his whatsapp and i saw too many gay contacts with even I'm in touch. i guess he was just giving hints that he knows my sexuality. and he took me to his senior Friend for drinks who was actually gay. A big shot rich unmarried gay who's 40+ . he said that he's coming to that senior house from last 6 years.and sometimes he even sleeps in his house. well my cousin bro is 25 and a kick boxer.
i have familiar neighborhood . we are almost like. a neighbour who's of my age is an open gay. he doesn't know that I'm also a gay, but he chats me with his fake id . i came to know that fake id is of my neighbour by my cousin. he told me that fake id is of that guy when i showed him. he even has photos and nos of my neighbor.</p>
<p>now say is he really into men? he can't be gay coz he had sex with girls. he might be bisexual or straight.. ??</p>
<h1>GCI- ALAA RE ALA SHIVAJI MARATAHA ALA RE!</h1>
<p>Aap kese hn huzoor??koi khidmat me kami to nhi rakhi na iss naacheez ne???</p>
<p>Why on the earth u want to know about ur cousin???U wanna have cousin sex kya???
What do u wanna do by being Ms. Maple or Sherlock holmes???</p>
<p>P.S- I love kickboxing and kick boxers...damn they are hot when they sweat!</p>

We are already suffering becuase of mrs. shama and mrs. verma....
