<p>How far are gay parades justified?
They cause public inconvenience, traffic jams, and do get violent eg Stonewall. They often depict vulgar stuff like long hanging penisis and stuff. </p>
<h1>GCI- It is a display of sexual minorities to celebrate their sexuality. And don't only raise a question on gay parades. In our country there is a procession of religious groups be it hindu, sikh, muslim or christian. But we don't say anything to them as it is in an honor of God. But when it comes to make people aware about the other dimensions, everyone looses their shit. Suddenly people go all law abiding citizens even if they are themselves the utmost rule breakers. Spare me the hypocrisy please. No one in india hols a low giant hanging penis in parades.That happens in the west and they don't have any problem with it. FYI, stonewall riots happened because queer people were fed up by the useless torture of the federal system of the US. When we don't get rights we have to retaliate in one or the other way. Wish you had the balls to accept the reality.</h1>
