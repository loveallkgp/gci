<p>I don't care others think about me. Maybe that's why I've become sorta less-social as well. I mean, if anyone has a problem with me being me, then that's not my problem, this is my attitude after accepting myself as Gay.
I dont care what my friends think about me being gay,  I dont care what my neighbors think and I dont think what my relatives n family think as well, as long as I can happily be what i am, I dont care others' opinion on ME .
But, still i cant come out !!!
The problem is not about not being accepted by the family , or friends or relatives or anyone else and thrown out; I can do without 'em (Its not like everyone's gonna leave me, tho' ). But the concern is the harm that will be done 'coz of me. :(
Truth is Gays are not accepted in our society yet, no matter what! (at least by most of our previous generation).
Coming out to the whole world is far away. I cant risk my sisters' n brother's marriage...cant risk making my parents' already miserable life more miserable. 
I cant leave everyone whom I love to suffer coz of me.
Sure, being gay is nothing wrong but in today's world, it is! Who would make the relatives and society understand? Will they understand? NO. coz they'll get a chance to mock and tease and humiliate my whole family. They will, I know. I can take all the shits on me but when it comes to my family, i cant let 'em suffer coz of ME.
My father, he once (Privately) told my mother that outta all the children he Loves me the most. That might be 'coz of the person I am. Everyone praises me saying its nearly impossible to find a person life me even in a million people. I am supposedly one of the best child you could wish for. Manners, grades, hard-working and all those good shits...but never did they know this perfect boy had a 'flaw' in him which was secretly eating him hollow inside.
The 'dent' in my otherwise perfect image could only be seen by me. I hid it the best way so that no once could lay a finger on me, ever.
Everyone in my family thought i was a bring star that was going to shine the family but always on inside i knew if i ever let 'em know the truth, I'll be the black ship of the family.
People kinda respect me, from juniors to olds, everyone. When i look at people in their eyes, i see some sorta respect for me which hurts me...whenever i see that, i feel like screaming "Dont think of me so good, I'm gay! I'm gay and when u'll know, u'll hate  me. So stop! "
I know, if i ever decide to tell my father and mother about me, they wont throw me away or disown me but they'll shatter. 
I cant see my father like that. The son he is sooo proud of,..oh God, no i cant do that. Sure, I wont marry, but never even my parents will know till their last breadth that their supposedly-perfect son could be less perfect...could break their soul.
I wont be able to live with the guilt that my  father might think he failed to do good to his child. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay let me break it down for you. You are not scared of your parents feeling shamed of you. You yourself think that you are the black ship. You yourself think you are the dent in your perfect life. You yourself think low about yourself being gay. You yourself think that you are the failed child. You yourself are ASHAMED of yourself. You are going more towards "what society will think". Well, newsflash, it always thinks crap. If your parents love you no matter what then your sexuality won't even matter. Out of 50 things you are, 49th would be gay and it is not the major reflection of your identity. You are gay, you are okay with it, that's it. I don't know why people try to find more reasons to feel bad about themselves. Itna hi dimag chalana hai to kisi badia cheez mein chalao.</h1>
<p>You cannot make your parents feel proud of yourself unless you feel proud of yourself. The choice is yours.</p>
