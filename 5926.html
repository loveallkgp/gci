<p>Hi dear friends, I'm here with a problem though many in India face it, I still Neva found a solution. Im 25 and about to be well settled, my parents are making serious trials to find a match for me, and already found 1 or 2 perfect matches. So I opened up to my family about my sexuality and that I'm not ready for marriage, they reacted as expected, parents think I'm over influenced by western culture and everything will be alright once I get married. My bro says I have to motivate myself and see a doctor. I do not really have any serious gay relationships and not even good friendships in this community so I don't have anyone who can understand to share with. I even told my straight best friend about it, he really tried to give me lot of moral support, talked to my parents, releived me from their pressure and bought me some time to think,but still he says that I should snap out of this and date with a girl, he even suggested some who are interested in me. I did not consider it, though he helped me a lot. One of my senior colleagues say that he knew a matrimony where I can find a match from lesbians, it looks convincing but I didn't like it. Given the present situation, what can I do? Im done searching for soul mates among gays, and having unrequited love to straight ppl. Finding a girl who can understand me looks practically impossible besides I never explored anything about girls. Finally, life seems to be a big question mark to me. Can any one here help?</p>
<h1>GCI- Hey bhagwaan! tu merese shaadi kar le..better hai!</h1>
<p>Show them the latest suicide case of the AIIMS lady doctor whose husband was gay. MARRIAGE IS NOT THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION FOR ANY GAY....AND I REPEAT MARRIAGE IS NOT THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION FOR ANY GAY GUY!
REASONS-
1- U live in a mental trauma day and night.
2- Ur soul gets wounded daily.
3- The pressure of making ur spouse happy creates mental depression even more.
4- If u stay away sexually then there is a silent invitation of adultery!
5- Even if you become a father ..u feel more low and not satisfied just because of the fact that you wont e able to teach ur children to live truthfully.
6- Being with a gender whom u cant feel for is no less than surviving on the islands of antarctica.
7- U must think a thousand times before taking any stupid step..
8- Love is not found where it is searched.</p>
<p>P.S- Please dont make such a hooplah of ur sexuality..even many strt people live without marriage...
Based on personal experiences and scientific researches!</p>
