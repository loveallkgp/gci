<p>I am in relationship with a guy who doesn't like human touch.i met him 4 months back and the moment I saw him , I knew I have found a heart for my heart.He is extremely adorable,cute and the best guy I cud ever wished for.U know, Exclusively made for mV had a nice chat for over two hour and coffee as well. When the meeting was over , I wanted to hug him but he not allowed me to do so. I thought OK , maybe ,it is our first meeting , he may be uncomfortable. but usne dil ki ghanti to baja Di thi. so we met few more times and I fell for him . but he was extrely hesitant to hug , hand shake or he was really uncomfortable when I use to touch him for anything ( frndly touch).he is an introvert . I knew it slowly as I get to know him more , I discovered he was such a pure soul with no ego , arrogance.i really fell for him.I fell for him the way he sips he coffee, the way he handle me, the way he used to treat me..he doesn't speak much but he do , he used to impress me like anything.so I proposes him on14/12/14.he said yes on 24/12/14 on Christmas eve when we met for a coffee.we haven't disclosed our relationship as yet to anyone.</p>
<p>now the problem is ,I want to hug him , kiss him ,get intimate. But I know he is not comfortable.i know i m not allowed , but he tempts me to do so everytime i see him. But i keep this feeling to myself. i never force him for kiss or hug or sex. we meet almost everyday even if it is for 10 minute.I am crazy for him .he also loves me. although ,he wud hardly say that. I hardly get a I love u too in response when i say I Love You to him .everyday. ,I feel like hugging him..even if its for second .i want to kiss him badly but I know I am not allowed..i just want to tell you , my dear love , that I am ready to wait .wait till eternity for our moment . I know one day you yourself gonna kiss me . I don't need your body, i can manage without sex but yes,I want your soul to b mine.. and one day, I know i wud b the sole authority of it. I love you forever..till eternity..!! One more thing, if I die early without your hug or kiss, pls Hug my dead body. this wud b my last wish.</p>
<p>From 'V' to 'D'</p>
