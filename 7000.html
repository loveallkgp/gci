<p>Seriously fed up of being a bi guy. Its awful.. It hurts wen a beautiful grl luvs u n u can't reciprocate back any true feeling bcoz u r bisexual. U will lyk her just for physical needs n social responsibilities. Otherwise u would hv always gone for a boy. It also hurts wen u fall for a handsome straight guy n he has nothing to give u in return except for his frndship if u knw him. U'll want sex frm him n will b ready to give him every pleasure but in vain. It mostly hurts wen u finally find a bisexual or gay guy whom u start liking but he comes out to be a fraud, a sex seeker who will use u for sex n wen he is done wid u he will search for another in stealth mode. Dats y most gay n bisexual guys r nick named as "sex seekers". Love is far beyond. I don't ask for a boyfrnd or lover. Coz my experience says most gays will go aftr sex wid each new guy they find attractive, each bi guy will hv a gf too which will make it difficult for him to keep a bf as he may feel d threat of getting exposed someday, each straight guy will always end up being ur bst frnd and ur drms of having sex wid him n loving him will b shattered anyway (more often wen he will b wid his gf and u r d one who will always witness those moments). Lastly each grl who fall in love wid u will b dumped or rejected by u coz at one moment in lyf u'll realize u can't love her n ruin her lyf anymore. So, its better to stay single. But d thing is people can't b alone all d tym. Yes we hv frnds.. Many frnds.. But its very rare dat they will understand n support u for who n wat u r. My motive of writing dis whole long essay is dat, I m not able to balance my life coz i m bi. Even motivation quotes n videos r not helping me gain some positivity for being bi. Every tym i go to meet bi guys thinking dey will b like me, i end up finding dem irritating n seeking sex. Dis is all i hv to say. I need a guy who hv dese same feelings n thoughts lyk me so dat i can find a true frnd in him for lyftym. I don't demand for love coz its not a thing which happens in d blink of an eye. It needs time. So i need a frnd.. A good frnd.. Wid whom i can share my time n feelings... Wid whom i can hv a life outside my life.. A home outside my home.. A partner outside my partner.. Love n sex will follow wid time..</p>
<h1>GCI- This is by far the 2nd or 3rd very genuine bi guy's post I have read that seemed sincere and emotive enough for me to empathise with the confessor.</h1>
<p>Well I will say 3 things 2 u-
1- Don't think that u can't satisfy anyone because satisfaction is our responsibility and not given by others.
2- Being Bi is very depressing and I can totally empathise but u must remember that love is beyond genders for bi men and if u choose to be with someone he or she must be having complementary mindset to be synchronised with u in all the phases of life.
3- You must remember that whether u r compatible with a guy or with a gal in all the aspects and then proceed accordingly for love, friendship and ultimately being with him or her for ur entire life.</p>
<p>P.S- U don't need to burden urself because u r bi, but u must carve a path of urs where u can be at peace with someone irrespective of his/ her gender or sex.
Gluck my boy!</p>
