<p>want a good suggestion from admin ......help me out .....
im gay (or bi).....i have a huge huge cruch on my bst friend..we met last year in a coaching centr(, spent one year n now we ar in diff university so not meeting him since june).he is cute-smart-hot; so its obvious to have cruch on him....as the time passed we becam bst friend......but the way he makes me feel special, his support n motivation.....all these things make me fall in love with him !! I dont think any one has done this for me...... Sometimes i think he is a gay too,bt he talks about girls a lot......ahh so much of cnfusn,
i cant share this feelngz with him, i dont wanna lose my bst friend, so is there any way to know wheather he is a gay or not ???  .....or is it just a illusion of mine  </p>
<h1>could nt write it well</h1>
<h1>GCI- I think he is just being a good friend. Countless are there who go through the same condition. Even I did at some point way in the past. Some straights care too. BTW, you should not carry it forward. You might end up jeopardizing your friendship with him. If he leaves, you will be more sad. Also, if you do want to know if he is gay or not, there are people who make fake accounts and text their crushes to know them. Take their inspiration. If he really is straight you have to back off because taking him into this would be something you'd feel terribly guilty about later on.</h1>
