<p>6 months ago when i was 24..
i got a very gud frnd on facebook and we did chating daily for near about one month. I told him that i m virgin yet but wanna to perform as top nd he told me that he is pure bottom.I started beleiving on him and we shared a lot of things of our personal lyf. Finally we planned to meet.... he told me that he is living alone in his rented flat so invited me to come at his flat. Next day i reached at his flat nd started kissing each other, he removed all my cloths and and his own too we both were nude on bed and suddenly his three frnds entered into the room who were already there in next room. I asked what is this and he said we all are top and luking for a bottom.. i started luking for my cloths but all of them suddenly jumped on me and all of them fucked me one by one badly.. they all reiuened me and i was praying god to take my lyf on the spot after there 4 hours torcher.after that they asked me to leave his house.. i went in a park and cried 4 next 2 hours and reached my home... i cried whole night bcoz of that pain nd on my mistake.. i know it was my mistake on beleiving someone stranger but learnt a big lesson on a very big cost and never met any guy after that.</p>
<h1>Viv- Guys, if you go to meet someone please have something with which you can protect yourself. Even if it is a casual meet. You do not know what kind of person you'd meet and you cannot trust anyone so early. Carry any sharp thing that you can use in self defense quickly. I myself carry some sharp pens(yes) with me but by the grace of God I haven't faced anything like this. Your safety is in your hands. And so sorry confessor that you had to go through this. Did you get the HIV and other STD and STI tests if it was unprotected? If you didn't, you HAVE to get them done asap!</h1>
