<p>Three years ago when i joined my college i saw this guy..Tall, muscular, fair with a beard on his chin handsome but one of those guys who are scary and can intimidate you with a simple stare. Now let me tell you i am about one third of his size and kinda cute kind!  which made me like him even more. 
Whenever i passed him in the corridors i will determinedly look straight away from him as since childhood i always had the problem with making an eye contact . When in the mess, I would steal a glance at him and was sometimes caught by him in the act. sometimes i think I saw him staring at me longer than required.  But since i am someone who was heavily bullied all my childhood i never had the guts to look him in the eye as i do not easily trust such "intimidating people". Whenever he passed me in the corridor i would abnormally look straight completely ignoring his presence.
 So the years passed and i never could muster enough courage
to look him right back in the eye. Why would he even be friends with me he was the "handsome hunk" and the "feared one" while i was  the bullied,  the laughing stock of the hostel.
 Anyways i think though he suspects something is going on in my mind there will never be a confrontation (at least not from my side. I risk too much doing that. and whom am I kidding he is straight most likely). But years later he will be just a fleeting memory and when we meet after say 10-20 years i can confess my infatuation to him and we  both may end up having a good laugh! </p>

<h1>GCI : first of all darling just beacause he has muscles , fair looks and is has beard ...doesn't mean he is superior. don't fal prey to their charm .</h1>
<p>even you know deep inside your heart that its not love and temporary attraction of lust and sex.( if u say no , i won't believe you ..seriously )</p>
<p>just beacuse you two crossed each others paths doesn't mean destiny wants you two to fall in love. its not movie . he might be str8 , he might be bi or he might be gay as well or he might be drag ( who knows ) ... it doesn't matter .. only thing matters is does he feel the same way you do ?? if yes .. he would have made a move . </p>
<p>and in 10 years you won't even remember him ..  and you two won't really meet .. globe is two big and you two will be living a  in a total different world. who knows after 10 years that guy loses all his charm and you become more charming , get a lovely BF and if anyhow he meets you would you confess that you once had a crush ????? NO ... nobody will ... </p>
<p>hear for right alarm and that will happen when  snooze off all the false alarms.</p>
