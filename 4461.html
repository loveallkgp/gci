<p>Hi Admin,
I am quite emotionally sensitive guy. I love life a lot, but not so much lately. I am bisexual and have had flings with both the sexes. About 1.5 years before, I got engaged to girl. Lately I have realized that my attraction towards girls is only till sex and after that it's over. With guys, I have feelings and emotions are flowing. I won't be keep my fiancee happy if I go ahead with the marriage. So, I decided to cancel this wedding altogether. But I don't have any solid excuse to end this and any lame excuse would catch up to me.
I can't come out to anyone at the moment because of a number of reasons. Moreover, in country like India, with law, society and religion against, I won't be able to survive long.
I am bit suicidal and thinking about it. I know it's a coward's way out but I am out of options. This way I would be able to preserve my fiancee's honor. This could be just a cry for help but either way, I have to make a choice. My family is very orthodox and they are doing everything they can to make me marry this girl. But if I go ahead with it, it would be a miserable life for me and her. And it's not fair to her.
Please guys advise.
Thanks
Chirag</p>
<h1>GCI- Keep the suicide option in bin, just figure out what option do you have? You already know how your life would be if you marry and you have already figured out about yourself. What is there to be said? Don't pay much attention to the society and all. The society will bark against you even when you get married and you will not keep your wife happy. Don't pay attention to religion either. Religious preachers are never right. Law is the major problem for now but it will ease up with time. You can survive if you have the heart to survive. It all depends upon you. Family will get you only so far. You are an adult and you are free to make your own decisions. Just for the sake of society and your parents' temporary happiness, you can't ruin your whole life. it has just started, you cannot let it go to waste. Think wisely man and don't think about suicide.</h1>
