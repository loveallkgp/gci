<p>17, Noida
Hello
Today, In early morning, I realised that I am finally and mentally prepared to be ina relationship. I see a lot many confessions here from delhi so I assume that there are quite a lot of gays in delhi.
BUT I don't think I'll ever get a boyfriend because-
1. I am not so cool. I am not ugly, neither handsome, sort of cute but I am little boring that's why I am not able to make friends.
2. I am not very intresting person. I am caring, loving but I don't have something, That charisma or I-Don't-Know-what which other guys have.
2. I am little fat. Although I have lost a lot of weight in these 3 months and I am still losing.
3. I think I expect a lot. I don't want a gay who is handsome but who has good personality, character and is loving, Understands me.
4. I am not-so-fashionable. My clothing choice is not that good because I always prefer those clotges which are confortable.</p>
<p>I hope all of you can provide me some solution.</p>
