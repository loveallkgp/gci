<p>Continuation of Confession # 4186
Guys, thanks for willing to listen. With all due respect to Ekta Kapoor, I am not in a mood for competition. I am not here to win story writing contest as well. Here is the shortcut. If anyone wants to listen completely, let me know through comments. I will post in a blog and share link.</p>
<hr>
<p>I never admitted to Rakesh that I was attracted to him, but we spend many nights together(doesn't mean we had sex). Once when I was kissing him in sleep, he said stop "someone else's name". This apart, there was one more gentleman who wanted to get between us. I sacrificed my career for Rakesh. I rejected Sonali, who is still waiting for me. Rakesh fell in love with another girl. I got heartbroken and went into depression. We met intermittently and finally I left the country to get away from him. But his memories still haunt me. After almost 2 years of complete silence, I am travelling to Delhi in Dec for work purpose. He lives in there, you guys please suggest If I should meet him and try to reconnect.</p>
<p>We know each others FB/Gmail passwords, and I know that he logs into my account to get whereabouts of me, but I never changed passwords.
I am not sure if I am BiSexual/gay, cause I am attracted to girls in general with exception to only one man in my life.</p>
