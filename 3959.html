<p>Guys please help.....
I was always a bi....but never had sex with any girl or a boy.....
I took coaching classes for some competitive exam, along with my college.....In coaching I made lots of friends....But 1 friend of mine was very cute, hot and sexy.
I was always looking at him....and I was his friend so always cracked non veg jokes.
But after few days I started cracking Gay jokes on us. For example...."I love u jaan'', "Give me a kiss" Lets go somewhere and have sex" etc......also in chat I use to call him darling and he also started doing that, he tells me darling, wenever in chatting i asked him to kiss he send me smiley with kiss. But in reality he never allowed me to kiss or even touch him.</p>
<p>After our coaching got over.....he never use to contact me and we never meet also.......But sometym I text him and he replies very well.....i still call him darling and i ask him for kiss...he also call me darling and give me smiley of kisses....but i know he is straight.......
Do u think he is interested on me? or pls tell me wat shld i do so that he starts loving me?
I cant stay away from him....pls give good suggestion....</p>
<h1>GCI- Darling, please don't be a shekhchilli and come out of the honeymoon fantasies. Its just texting and he doesn't even talk to you outside the class or whatever. There is a possibility that he may be having some latent homosexual feelings but if he is not comfortable showing them then you can't force him. It will fall upon you. If you don't care about the result then go on. And I don't think he can do the mature talk.</h1>
