<p>Hi.. 23 m Delhi.. I was in a relationship for almost 5 years.. he was my best friend, my mate, my soul, my everything.. Our relation reached its saturation so we mutually broke up.. well it dint end up good for any of us..I had ego issues n so did he.. its like 2 years now we are seprate and we dont talk to each other anymore.. From just a stupid first sight crush it went to a silly teen love and transformed into a highly matured relationship.. After we broke up I felt this hole inside me, I used to miss him almost everytime..I realised that i am truly in love with him when I lost him completely..this shock isolated me from the society, complete sabotage..I stopped talking to all my friends both from school and college..I was always at home, inside my room for about one complete year..Finally i gathered myself..later afterwards by God's grace I got some really good gay friends..Unfortunately, a guy fell in love with me.. having received a lot of counseling sessions from all my friends, that this guy loves u a lot and he will help u move on..his love will heal you. .I said a yes to him..
But it dint go well, I dint want to fool him so I broke up wd him as well.
Now the problem is I still dont get attracted to anyone, dn feel the same like I used to..not attracted even sexually to someone, as a result becoming asexual day by day.. I just cannot forget him, "Uske alawa kuchh nhi, usse acha kuch nhi..wo nhi to kuchh bhi nahi"..guys plz tell me wat to do,a solution n please spare me with the advices cz even I am hell good at consoling people and has seen all the good and dark sides of this gay world and hence i can differentiate between right and wrong.. now the point is -Is der something wrong with me that is either biological or psychological ,which i am unaware of..Or is that true ki pyaar sirf ek baar hi hota hai, rest is just move on.. Should I suicide or live like happy singles, earn and drink.. Or should I take my heart out and chop it into thousands of pieces.. or in the name of moving on should I start fooling people or date randomly, which is the trend of delhi and warm other's bed.. which is so not me.. then what the hell should I do..Is it some kind of a Witchy juju or a bad mojo that he did on me..because forgetting him is like losing my existence which is impossible and I have tried every single thing, starting from consoling myself to counseling and communicating, crying my heart out to god, friends etc..also, now in no case we guys will ever be together, he won't come back no matter whatever I do.. I let him go because he wanted to, but still my heart didn't let go of him..Then what else is left to do ? :/
(Sorry, i know its very long but i hv tried to sum up 7 years of my life here)..</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh! That's terrible. You have figure out what things are holding you back to him and start loosing them turn by turn. 5 years is not less to be forgotten in a short time of 2 years. You need a much more time. For now just be single and enjoy the single life. Enjoy every single day of it and be friends with some quality people. There will be a time when you will be ready. You just need the spark back in your life that you had. If possible, go for a therapy session. Be strong buddy. Its not the end of the world because every ending has a new beginning after it.</h1>
