<p>It was a day...... i felt I... shud not have left him.
I'm gay 23 new delhi.....</p>
<p>He met at the night of dj near my place. I had this party going on....more like my success party.
I was standing near my buds but suddenly I felt strange... a guy had this watch n was keeping it down again n again on the table.
I wantd to go there n ask but I stopped n observed. what found was way more shocking..... It was alrdy broken...i checkd wen I passed him by.
before I cud ask smthng he ran to wash rum n washed his face. ...i cud nt stop I followed n asked him.."dude wats up with watch ..?". ...Just wen he held his head high i was stunned to see red teary eyes... bt a smile on his face. He stared n said wat made you come here. .. i was speechless but i said i saw u struggling with your watch. He said ...mind your own business. !!
But just he moved thr was a bleeding going on in his hand. I pulled him bck n asked fr god sake. ...Plz let me knw y r u still wearing this watch ?
he gave me glare n tuk his hanky to put on his wound...n said I need to leave.
I still didn't let go of him n said cm with me 
he could resist my request n followed.
I cud nt it was my party n wat I was upto. 
thr were tears in his eyes n tht cute face....He thn said "y..??"
I said tell me your story....Plz !
he rpld I broke up 2day....n this was my gift 
to sum1 I love ....... tht watch !!
I was shocked n asked y r u wearing it thn ?
he snatched his hand n let go me n walked Alone..........
i found sum thing there's this sticker under his sleeve left .....had his blood drops over it...may be got detached frm thr i read the words "Happy go life wid amit ...
my Swthrt ankit anuj
lov you anuj ankit .</p>
<p>I didn't think or imagine .... wt pain he must have went thru ..It was nt only a glass tht shatterd tht nyt. 
I watch him gone blurred on his bike .....into darkness of nyt. How he gave me a last luk while walking out...
he Didn't even knw wat I have knwn abt him nw...
If only he knew I was d first person with whom he cud share his feelings. </p>
<p>I asked my frnds alot abt him but none of em seemed to knwn him well...He came with my frnds thr. 
And that nyt......was just nt a party to me!!</p>
<p>p.s.- it was really a moment I wanna hug him......but he was broken in piece n I didn't which one to hugg first !!</p>
