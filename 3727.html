<h1>Animesh Pandey this side,19years old gay.</h1>
<p>This confession is in memory of a great fighter,Late Swagat M Shah,Gay activist from Gujrat who fought for gay rights and was someone who was the reason of my strength.Hedied due to some health issues yestermrng.LGBT lost one of the very sweet inspiring and helpful member.I would say one of the biggest figher for LGBT rights.He was out and proud gay lived fearlessly and with great Pride.May his great soul rest in peace since he inspired me and encouraged me to be real me on a dating site.He is inspiration for many gays.When i used to regret about my sexuality and loose all hopes to get a genuine and understand Lifepartner and accptance in family and soceity he was the one who encouraged me all the time and asked me to stay strong as we all,as an individual,are the futre for Gay community.</p>
<p>One of his dream was EQUALITY $ UNITY in LGBT community.He never beleived in the gays or Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans but put Humanity first.Bt sadly most of the gay r busy in critising others and talking big big things just on this virtual platform.Here most of the people just talk big things hardly nyone beleives in implenting the same thing what they say here on public platform.I m not saying come out or reveal ur idenity asap atleast if u can't water the plant then don't pluck it for ur own selfishness and need.</p>
<p>All i would say Love and be Loved.Live and Let Live if u can't accpt someone leave them.Put Humanity first.Love evryone hate none.</p>
<h1>GCI- May he rest in peace.</h1>
