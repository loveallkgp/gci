<p>/// Sourabh Sharma:</p>
<p>Sale tum apni family k name pe dhhabba ho///</p>
<p>This was the comment on my confession (no. "1936") which badly broke me into pieces. Never expected that I will get this type of reply from a "gay"man. I dunno why after that confession gays are acting as "enemies of gays". Their replies were such that they hadn't encountered with any family which is strict regarding family values.</p>
<p>I want to say a few words to him.</p>
<p>You say that 'main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon'. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I am a gay.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because just because I am attracted to men.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I am not a heterosexual.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because heterosexuality is nowhere in my nature.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I can't go against my nature and live a heterosexual life.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I refuse to marry a woman.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I am no more ashamed of my sexuality.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I am combatting "family homophobia" and "family bullying".</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I can't live the way my family wants.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I am fighting for my sexuality.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I am now open, out and proud.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I no more scared to face the questions that are thrown on my sexuality.</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because now I can answer when anybody asks, "Log kya kahenge?"</p>
<p>'Main apni family ke naam par dhabba hoon', just because I am what I am.</p>
<p>Call me whatever you want. Call me kamina, call me kutta, call me mc, call me bc, use any abusive words, insult me a lot. Do whatever, but that won't change anything.</p>
<p>You should know that homophobia and bullying are not just limited to outside of four walls of home, bullying and homophobia can also exist within the family. I have guts to face against them and stand for myself, though I am standing alone.and almost everybody around me is a homophobe.</p>
<p>And if you don't have guts, then you have no rights to say anything against those who have enough courage to stand up for themselves.</p>
<p>And lastly, if you don't have anything good to say, then don't speak bad.</p>
