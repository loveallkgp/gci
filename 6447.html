<p>Hi there, I am 23 male from Pune. I am gay. I work for TCS and it has been 2 years. I am from Delhi basically. One and a half years back I met a guy online who worked in the same TCS campus as me, but in a different project. He was one year senior to me. We almost clicked instantly. We started having lunch together everyday and became best friends, soon our relationship turned physical too. He was not happy with his project so I talked with my manager to take him in. He cleared the interview and got in. I helped him with the project work flow and process as he was new. Soon our physical relationship started tumbling as he used to force me to suck him or get fucked even when I was not in the mood. He always declined the same when he didn't wanted too. He had also put on weight and had started to look repulsive. Since we never committed to each other I started getting physical with other men which were much more satisfying. But now he is in the same project and sits just next to me. It is a torture to see him everyday. It's even more difficult to ignore him. I just pass a fake smile when I pass by him. He does the same with me too. Sometimes he just ignores me. Our colleagues have also sensed that once we were such good friends now we hardly speak with each other. I don't know what to do please suggest. </p>
