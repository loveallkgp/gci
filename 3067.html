<p>This is with respect to confession 3059. Well I cannot confirm if his claim is true or not but I have personally experienced something similar but no clinical experts were involved. I was straight then I turned bi and then gay bottom. However I was not happy with my sexuality so made an attempt to change it. I stopped watching gay porn and stopped looking at men. Whenever I saw a hot man I would look in the other direction. I even made a resolution to change and began spending time with girls. Gradually my preference changed and now I have a very little of gayness left in me. Actually gayness is not a disease it is just a choice we make and we can change our choices by making a firm resolution if we are unhappy with it. </p>
<h1>GCI- I don't know that why these guys, who are supposedly "cured" of their gay sexuality are doing here. We are trying to help people to accept themselves so that they can have a better life legally, but guys like you are completely being discomforting for the lot of them and you guys are creating more confusion for already confused people.</h1>
<p>PS- Its not a FUCKING choice. You choose to ignore the reality. Your happened-to-be-straight sexuality is a phase. Come here after 3 months. I can guarantee that you will be finding someone to get laid with.</p>
