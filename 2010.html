<p>As per confession 2000's comment.. m the same guy who is in relationship with a foreigner for last 17 months.. I dont live in india..
@GCI I am afraid of loosing them after telling the truth..
@dev ur idea sounds crazy enuff but its a fact that it is the way gays here choose.. I luv my partner very much and my parents too.. donno what I will do if comes a time to choose between them.. I get thrilled wheneva I think of this situation..</p>
<h1>GCI- See buddy, you have to make a choice one day or the other and you have to take a stand. Better decide what you want and made a decision without regrets. And as far as marrying a lesbian is concerned, I really can't support the idea according to my thinking process. The gay guys and lesbian girls can be each other "beards" infront of the society, parents to hide their true "skin" but at the end you will be living a shallow lifestyle with both partners spending the day with their same sex partners. How long would you think that the arrangement would go. For a short term it does sounds good as it is a nice escape from the reality(thats why so many people agreed) but in a long term scenario do you think you will be able to hold it together? You should have the guts to be true to yourself and make your parents understand that there is nothing wrong with you and you can be happy if and only if you are not married to a girl. Afterall for parents, your happiness matters if they don't think about society and stuff.</h1>
