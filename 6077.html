<p>Few days ago I was reading a status, My best friend said that you are not completely gay and he wants to make me straight..... </p>
<p>and than the admin said,, leave your friend right now,, who does not understand your orientation,, a few comments have the same tone,, </p>
<p>is this a solution?? or it show our immaturity??
my parents does not understand my orientation,, should I leave them??,, Indian does not understand what gays feel,, Should gays leave India?? 
The need is to educate people about homosexuality,, not to escape from them who does not understand,, hope you will agree n post this confession.</p>
<h1>GCI- OK the other admin said something and you didn't get the inner meaning i guess../Now listen if your friends don't understand u as a person and judge u by your sexuality ARE THEY REALLY FRIENDS????....If your parents don't understand that you are brought up in a hetero society and u have not come from Neptune for god's sake will you feel like being with them??? If our country doesn't understand what is being gay THEN I AGREE WITH U HERE....And please do give a reality check to those who always have tonnes of excuses to hide under the bed even when they can make a difference!</h1>
<p>P.S- No one is your friend, kith or kin if you are supposed to suppress your truth and be self-oppressing and who make u silent on being the real you...U owe the most to yourself and your soul NOT to others all the time.</p>
