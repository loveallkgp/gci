<p>Hi everyone. The story/ confession is about two faces of THIS LIFE. One represented by me a straight looking discreet GAY and another by a guy, Anup (fake name, jut for understanding) who had been living alone for a long time because of his hard circumstances. Anup was feminine, struggling with his career, hard to cover up his sexuality because of his GOD gifted feminine qualities. But there was one common ground that both I and Anup were in separate relationships. Our encounter began in early 2013 and ended in the after math of 11/12/13 verdict of the Supreme Court which reaffirmed the constitutional validity of Section 377. Anyways, coming to the story, I was chatting with Anup for a long time. He was staying out of India to earn a living while his boyfriend was staying in India. I at that time was working in the city and my boyfriend was also in a good job. I and Anup were good frinds through a social networking site. One day he returned to India and he entered into a business course (1 yr duration) in my city. I took out some time and went to visit him in his rented accomodation. I didnot told anything to my boyfriend as I knew I was committed to him and telling him such thing would unnecessary complicate matters. I came to Anup looking for some fun and no attachment. As I entered his room we shared our stories with each other. After a while I started to get cosy with him and opened my shirt and trousers. I attempted to undress him and touch his ass. He was very reluctant. I was trying to convince him. All on a sudden he burst out into tears like a child. I felt compassionate towards him and I hold him into my arms and asked him "What happened ? Any problem ? Why are you crying ?" He said 'I love him too much. Can't live without him (his boyfriend who is from his hometown). Can't do this with you.' I said "OK. AM sorry. Will not touch you again". Calling my name he said "He is tired of fighting for acceptance. Also as GAYS are not faithful to each other, Supreme Court must have refused to recognize that they exists". In due course he told me about his boyfrind and how they are struggling to come to terms with the other world and family members. We didnot do anything. Actually I felt sorry that I made him cry. I never met him another time as for the following reasons : we don't have similar personalities, we are of different social and educational status, being extemely busy I don't get sufficient time, whenever i have spare time I spend it with my boyfriend and I am committed to him, so there was no point in taking that relationship further. But I loved him that day for his honesty, simplicity, vulnerability, and an infinite amount of hidden pain and frustration. For the first time I felt how lives are suffering because of a negetive Court verdict. Frankly speaking I never felt it (that the Court verdict adversely affected so many lives) so deeply for myself as I did it for Anup. I hope he is always well and living a happy life with his love.</p>
<h1>GCI- That sounds like a movie story. One thing I don't get it that why do you have to try to seduce him if you both were in relationship with your respective partners? There are those who are totally monogamous and their lives are totally in trouble because of the verdict. You know how is it out there for the gay couples who are out and proud these days? Its just a matter of someone loosing his patience and getting angry that a gay couple will be reported to the police by a homophobic person. At the same time if we put up wrong image, we can't have expect out rights anytime soon. I used to say before that if disloyalty happens in homosexual people, it happens in heterosexual people as well. That is make our people understand that we are not the ones who have the negative side only. But when it comes to the bigger picture it should be seen that heterosexuals have their rights and we are fighting for ours. So we indeed have to set out better examples so that other people can have their mindset changed. Life for us is never easy but we can always fight by being honest and true to ourselves.</h1>
