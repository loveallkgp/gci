<p>Hello guys I am 20 years old bisexual guy from Northeast and currently doing my Law honours.My problem is that I am very close to one of my classmate buddy,we hang out together,he cry along with me when I m emotional and he care so much for me and we mostly spend times together more than anyone else.As time pass by I have fallen in love with him madly because no one understands me like he do.I believe he is straight and has a girlfriend.What should I do guys shall I approach him and tell him my feelings or what shall I do.please help its killing me inside.or do u guys thinks he love me too because sometimes it shows in his actions he love me too.I am confused</p>
<h1>GCI- Straight guys can be emotional too. You have to understand this. Whether he is gay or not, it's his decision to tell. If you think he'd be okay with LGBT stuff, you can come out to him as your bond is strong(as you say). Know him first and then do whatever you want to do man.</h1>
