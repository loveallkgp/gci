<p>I don't know why it didn't cross my mind that I can ask it here.
I am aware of my self that I am a emotionally vulnerable or weak person. Now being gay and in closet, i have to be always guarded of my emotions or say have to be conscious all the time in any social setting. I never had alcohol, and now i have developed a fear that if I drink alcohol I may lose my conscious or being aware of what i am saying or doing. But denying drinks all the time considering my age and professional life, where females friends also drink,i have to face a lot of heat from friends,relatives and especially colleagues. Tell me if I am right or wrong denying drinks. My premise is that being emotionally weak my body will lose conscious faster than an average person while drinking which i don't want at this point of my life.</p>
<h1>GCI- Always drink that much where you know what you are saying and can have a control over your head.</h1>
