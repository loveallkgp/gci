<h1>GCI- Well, you should have thought about that before. But now the damage is done.</h1>
<p>One way to look at it is that pictures can be edited by anyone who is skilled. That guy is blackmailing you and harassing you. You haven't had any sex with him, so you are in the clear. No one can say anything to you. The law is on your side. You can threaten him that you will file a complaint against him in the cyber crime department. If he posts your pictures, that will indeed be a cyber crime and he will suffer loads if he is tracked.</p>
