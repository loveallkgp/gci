<p>Hello! Need some insight from you on something I am gonna share with you. I know this straight guy since 2007, from my workplace. We both met when he was going through some crisis in his life. Thanks to my counseling skills and sound Bible knowledge, he was so impressed by me. We both stayed in touch through phone calls and SMS. Around 2009, he contacted me when he was deep down in depression and was at a crossroads in his life. I stood for him. Time saw us coming much closer to each other. Trust me, it was literally like a full blown affair. He used to call me day in n day out. I was already attracted to his charm and beauty but since he was seeking support from me, I kept my lusty side suppressed. He used to come to my place and stay overnight. Regular talks late into the night and staying together often triggered lust in me towards him. I used to massage him, and he loved it. It was lust for me. Most of the times, he asked me for it. I even removed his undie and massaged his bubble butts! But he never let me to touch his cock.</p>
<p>This went on for as long as a year! We had huge arguments over some money that I lent him. Also, he was going to be married soon. His marriage date and my birthday are same. He so arranged it that way, it seems! I thought I may never own him like I want to. So, I took back my money, and severed all ties with him. He tried to stay connected but I refused. This went on for three long years.</p>
<p>I forgave him for all the harsh words he spoke to me, and gmy hands someday or the other!</p>
<p>ot back with him last year end. We met in January of this year. His wife is at his in-laws house for the time being. So, he started coming to my place like before. To my surprise, he again asked me for massage. I am amazingly shocked at how open he is now to my touch. He is even letting me touch his cock without any resistance. I am making him completely nude. It is definitely not like we are doing it while we "act like sleeping." He is wide and talks sweetly during all this. Last time, he even indirectly asked me for a blow job. We both spent our night together this past Saturday. I so much love him, and enjoy sleeping in his bosom! He too verbalizes his love and admiration for me. He was showing me his wedding pics, and jokingly pointed out to his wife and said that it should have been me in that place!</p>
<p>But and but, he never fondles me nor cuddles me. He doesn't touch me. Mostly, he lets me do whatever I want to. Before we broke off, he never let me touch his cock. After we got back together again, he is open for me touching his cock and even sucking it. I so much wish he would realize my heart's desire and be mine as I expect him to be! I am aware I can't own him since he is married and has a kid.</p>
<p>Admin, anything that you see that I am ignoring or rather blinded to, in all this drama of lust and love? Yeah, I am keeping my eyes open that this bird may even fly out of </p>
<h1>GCI :he is either gay who married a girl just for the happiness of his family and because of social pressure . as that guy who can't handle the basic problems in his life how would he have courage to come out.</h1>
<p>or simply he isn't happy with his wife's service and you are better service provider. so keep ur lust aside and break all connections with him. it will save many lives . find somebody single, unmarried and of your age and gay... for your needs darling .</p>
