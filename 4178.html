<p>hello</p>
<p>I have been checking most of the posts on this page for the last few days... I want to share something with everyone...</p>
<p>" I dated a lot of girls during my school days and never had that love feeling for any guy back then. I have been using social networking sites for the last 7 years. I met a lot of guys from there. Very few of them could leave footprints in my life. One of them was my first boy friend. It was being with him that I could taste true love for the first time. We met on 5th Nov, 2010 after chatting for a few days on a dating site. That day still remains the most memorable day of my life. It was the occasion of Diwali. We went to rabindra sarobar lake (kolkata). We sat there on a bench. Crackers bursting everywhere made the sky look so beautiful and the reflection could be seen on the waters of the lake in front of us. There was a club near that part of the lake and music was being played. There's a railway station beside the lake. Trains were passing at regular intervals too. So overall the atmosphere was truly amazing. One could hardly ask for a better date. And then he started telling me about his life. Suddenly he proposed to me and we kissed. I couldnt stop myself from falling in love with him. And that day changed the course of my life. I had the most memorable moments of my life in those 5 months of our relationship. We broke up and it was just because of me. I was over-possessive and obsessive about him. He had already started to feel caged and a day came when he could break the shackles and set himself free. It took me around 2 years to recover fully after that. There was not a single moment I didnt miss him but he never came back. I started ruining my life after he broke up with me. I was a virgin when he came in my life. I started dating guys just to move on but it never seemed to work. I started to smoke, take weed and tabs, booze. With time, my life became more complicated. I just want to ask a simple question to everyone ---- If you really love someone, then is it impossible to accept him the way he is ? "</p>
<p>Tell me is it wrong being possessive about my life partner? I wanted him to be just mine. Did I make a mistake? "</p>
<h1>GCI- Tell me what are the roots of being over possessive? Is it like you don't trust your partner or you feel jealous if your partner talks with other guys.</h1>
<p>If yes, then if your guy says that he loves you and wants to be with you repeatedly then you can leave your insecurity. All of these feelings arise when you don't trust him fully. When you know your partner and you know that he is loyal to you, then by being over possessive you are just killing the love because no one can take the pressure for this long. </p>
<p>Life is a journey of bad mistakes but you never realized it, be it during the relation or after the relation.</p>
