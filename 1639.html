<h1>Viv- You my dear are falling prey to the circumstances. He cannot get the girl you like and you cannot get the guy you like. First of all, you didn't do anything wrong. A hard reality had to come on the surface and you helped him see it. He can focus his thoughts on someone else. In the meantime you have to get focused on someone who can like you back the way you want. He can be your best friend but he cannot be your life partner. Now, what you can do is to get in contact with someone who can share your likes. Maybe in that person you can get what you are looking for. Try to move on from him.</h1>
