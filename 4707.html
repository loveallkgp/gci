<p>Hey GCI
Have been a Silent reader for a while ..
Umm
I wanna tell my whole story ...
I have been in gay life for 2 yrs i was like a bitch who used to use gay for my satisfaction but a year before in May 2013 everything for me turned around ..i met a random guy (name same as mine -coincidence)
He was new nd virgin he proposed me after a meet nd i accepted (thought of use nd throw) but after being in this drama thing i realised that i actually liked him ..was unable to detach himm so i decided to dump him... But i wasnt able ..then i seriously proposed him ..we were happily together with lil fights in relation (break ups nd patch ups -i know everyone will find this bit silly n kiddies thing) but i actually like it ...
But few days before he caught cold n fever nd i never bothered about him so he got pissed off from me nd now he is trying to move onn ...m trying to convience him but he is not listening ...he called it a Quit !!
[I never cared for me , m silly , i dont care for his feelings sometimes , He is just too caring n lovable his activities for me are too sweet ... But on the other m dumb as fuck ]
P.S - He has done many things for me that no one could have done .. He makes me feel special , he crossed his limits just for me ..m mentioning all this because i will txt him to read this atleast once ..
I know m dumb but i love you and that wont change ...may be i cant care for you like you cared but i will try .. I know i have always been a bitch .. Neglecyted you for friends nd girls but neleive me i will try to change.. May be what ever i wrote is not in proper paras but understand wat u mean to me nd wat m trying to convey ...
Pls forgive me my boy</p>
<h1>GCI- You really have to make it upto him. Words will be empty if they don't mean. Getting him back is just the first step. You have to do those very things he does to you.</h1>
