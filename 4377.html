I'm very sad always i cry i dn't lyk to study whenevr i open my books i see his face. 2 weeks ago sumhow i passd my selection test but now i 'm thinkin' myslf i'll not write my final exm b'coz if i'll fail it will be very shameful to me. I love him very much i really do even i keep fasting for him. Please suggest me friends.. </p>
<h1>GCI- Okay, stop whatever you are doing for him or in his name. You are on the path of self destruction and he doesn't even care. His life is set(somewhat) and you are destroying yourself. He thought about himself first. Don't be so selfless that you are ready to give your life for him. Relationship is a two way communication. Ain't no one should keep on working for it when there is no effort from the other side. Just move on and forget.</h1>
