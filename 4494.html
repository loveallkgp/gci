<p>i have a question for you fellow gays !
please everybody comment here. - either yes / no.
How many of you are involved into sports / athelete type games ?
Any zonal, district, national level players here ? or atleast street players ?
i want honest answers from almost all of you, like a survey.
I am seeing often gays are telling, they are not into sports. is that so ?
I am not stereotyping, as being has nothing to do with playing outdoor games, I am a gay myself and play with my friends as an entertainment, not a real player, though I would love to become one.
I think people are anti - sports people are lazy people and has nothing to do with being gay, but I just want to be sure, to check it once by myself.
please onte that i am not offending anyone, I am not stereotyping anyone, I have this genuine doubts for which i want genuine answers. Hope you ll take this in right sense. Thanks !</p>
