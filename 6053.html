<p>I don't hate my bf and I am not cheating on him either. But I didn't miss him like I miss him last year. We used to talk every single day during our first 3 months of relation. Slowly the call time reduce. Now we used to meet only once in a week on weekends. I don't know, but I think I am not a bf type guy. I enjoyed going to parties and going for coffee with him every weekend and we have same likes when it comes to coffee and parties. But somehow I don't love him anymore. I just love him like a friend now. I wanted to break up with him but he is doing master final year so I am scare that if I broke up with him now then it might ruin his career. So should I wait for another year and broke up with him on his graduation day or should I broke up with him now. Guys who have broke up before please gimme some suggestion.</p>
<h1>GCI- hmmmm....Nice &amp; interesting case of urs! Now listen patiently!</h1>
<p>1- U loved him..he loved u...ITS OK to not feel the same kind of feelings u had a year ago. 
2- Dear love also changes its forms and the maximum period of romance is 3 yrs or 18 months (psychological studies).
3- There comes a phase when we feel contented and we feel we have no spark left. See our brain cannot handle too much of dopamines or feel good hormones too for a long time and hence UR CONDITION arises..and it is very normal!(love keeps us excited).
4- Love is always not about  how much u attached..love is also about how much u both set each other free and felt like not being with the wrong person.
5- U are experiencing the state of BEING THERE DONE THAT! and that is perfectly fine...strt couples go through the same..that doesn't mean they divorce or breakup, instead they grow more WITH EACH OTHER in a new way!
6- U wanna break up...but why??? U are not happy or are u sad with him??? Dear its understandable that u both are alike and u wanna go away....but where???TO repeat the same shit cycle of finding someone better or igniting the spark with someone else???
7- Never leave a person with whom u grow and who touches ur soul more than ur body.
8- U think u have fallen out of love!! Maybe..but what if not???What if u r just having a phase of contentedness and would want to return back &amp; he denies it then??? see dear its OK to have dissimilar thoughts too in a relationship....but they must make u understand urself more.
9- U must analyse urself what exactly u desire!!
10- On the Unconditional front we don't have any reason to love a person but on the practical side we have more than one thousands to count for!</p>
<p>The choice is yours! 
P.S- Love is not about breaking up or patching up or making a new bf..its about what u felt....why u felt...with whom u felt &amp; how long U strived for to refine ur love everytime u felt it had tripped!</p>
