<p>Hy everyone!<br>
I am 20 years old. I am going through a rough time as i love someone with no future. It all started this year. I met someone , he's from diff city so do i. It was my frst time talking to someone. So i started talking and as i m bit conservative it took me much time to open up to that person. He was very caring loving but then problems started I'm very good looking and virgin. He started saying i love you, can't live without you and i completely felt for him, infact i got obsessed with him. I started talking to him 6-7 hours a day. After 3 months i got to know he's married and whatever he told me was a lie, from his age to his martial status everything was fake. We broke up. But i still love him . Then i realised that i can't live without him and we again started talking. Today I've lost much weight. I am stressed totally . I am doing something which has no future but i love him. He treats me badly because even he knows I'm there for him no matter what. I'm helpless broken and shattered. Somedays back i got to know hes dating a guy too which he denied. I can't live without him and he's not even ready to leave him.. but it's not helping me .! </p>
<h1>GCIL- R U EVEN HUMAN?!</h1>
<p>I am lately seeing cases with people having no self esteem at all.....honey cultivate some of it and u will automatically get to know what to do.</p>
