<p>Just want to share some of my taughts, some may accept it and some might not but let it be...
so i hear many gay teens commiTting sUicide after recieving some homophobic reactions by their school mates,family members and by people around them. I feel that its so Tragic and foolish of them to commit suicide because he or she loses their precious life which they are never going to regain it back moreover life is a gift from God and we are fortunate to live it, some even don't get the chance to live it. You Might find some difficulties while facing this situation so make sure you talk to someone whome you can trust, choose carefully while making friends, talk to your elders, parents or ur siblings and explain nicely about your feelings let them understand what you feel ..... but taking your own life because others mock you for being gay thats totally bullshit... dnt worry there are people who hates you aswell as  loves you that is life . learn to stand from them be brave, i am not saying that you fight with them but learn to defend yourself from any situation... so guys do not think about committing suicide and stay safe .</p>
<h1>GCI : i understand your motive here and i appreciate it.</h1>
<p>but i can't ignore the fact why suicides happen . it when your parents are ignorent and you siblings are narrow minded fucks and when you don't have friends .  to some who need permission to go out from parents , talking about your sexuality isn't even option there .?? </p>
<p>moms come up with ' typical rona dhona ' and dads think ' there son isn't a man ' . and if you try to even say a single word a 'big slap will be stamped on your face'. </p>
<p>question is how top make ' DESI PARENTS" understand this thing in a ' DESI WAY' ???</p>
