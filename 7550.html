<p>Hey Admin
I want to ask a few questions which keep haunting my mind quite often...
1. Wat am I  gonna do wen I start earning nd ppl start pressuring me for marriage?
2. Wat abt the humiliation my parents will hv to face coz of it?
They like any other parent in the world might be having some expectations from me....I often get disturbed by thinking about them.
3. I don't know wat to do next.
I used to believe that there is freedom of blah blah guaranteed to us but while talking to several ppl I came to knw that young ppl many of them don't want to marry or have kids(the free ka tension) ,but they tell its the way society works.....so wen these straight (legal ) ppl don't hv the blah blah freedom wat of ours....?do we too need to act ,the way society wants us too???
Especially I would be thankful if u could tell abt ur own experiences with such issues and how hv u dealt with them ??after all this platform which u hv provided is like a second home .....not much of wat I hv asked here would I hv dared to ask my near ones in the real world....loads of thanks for dat:)</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, you know your parents more than I do, but there is something common in all the desi parents. The fear of society. If you think they will fear the society more than sticking for your happiness, then they don't love you enough.</h1>
<p>That might be a bit wrong of me to say  because the generation of our parents is not made aware about gender and sexual identities. </p>
<p>I haven't dealt with these situation yet because I haven't come out till now. It will not be long for me. My partner and I were discussing about it and decided that until and unless I have a assurance of my personal and financial security, I am not gonna do that. But whatever the case is, I will come out one day. There is no way that I am gonna succumb to the social pressure and emotional drama that has been fed to our society by movies and tv soap operas.</p>
