<p>M 22</p>
<p>hello admin,</p>
<p>I am here after a long time, i have been disturbed lately because of something that happened between me and my crush.</p>
<p>I have a crush on a guy, he is a really good friend of mine, for almost a month, we both were sharing his room, one night just for fun sake, as a bet we had sex, he fucked me.</p>
<p>then after that 3 times, we again had sex and all the times it was him who initiated, also during that time, he would wrap me with his body while sleeping but there was one thing that was very disturbing that every time we would have sex, he would sit and think as if he has done something wrong, it used to hurt me a lot.</p>
<p>I thought that he is having issues in accepting the reality, so i didn't bother him much n continued, but then he said that he had sex with me just because of lust and because i am effeminate and he was imagining a girl while fucking me.</p>
<p>For him, he says that it doesn't matter that we have had sex but for me it matters a lot. Now sometimes i feel that he is having hard time accepting the reality but then mind says that it was just lust, i still love him like mad and we are still in contact, he cares a lot about me admin. I feel so confused.</p>
<p>Please try to understand the situation and give me suggestion, I am the same with dumb zombie lover name :P </p>
<h1>Viv- Of course he is trying to deny the reality and as per his behavior he will never accept it in near future. You think about yourself in this matter. What do you want in your life? Someone with a clear thinking or someone confused as him? If you go with the latter, one day or the other you will have a breakup and you know what happens after it. If you go with the former, you can atleast expect that life will be beautiful for you. Get over him and leave him be.</h1>
