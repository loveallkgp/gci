<p>I wonder why there are so many sex seekers? I tried to search for true love and many people who wanted me, claimed that they will truly love me but after meeting them just for once, they too turn out to be sex seekers, it's so irritating and that's why i've decided to not find any partner and if i don't get someone, i will be happy to live lonely,happy and independent life. That's what japanese are doing, they too are no longer intrested in relationship, that's why they are not marrying because it restricts their freedom and gives them loadful of boring and tiring responsibilities, i think it' better to live your life by detaching yourself from sexual pleasures and desires and let those things go which are not meant for me. </p>
<p>Ps-and members of this page, please don't comment "let's be friends" "i'd like to meet you" blah blah.</p>
<h1>GCI : see honey i understand what you are going through ..there are many like you here . but where have you searched for true love ' on fb , on PR ,on whatsapp or on any other social networking site .. ....  first thing ..love can't be found ..it happens . you can't go to a stranger and 'slip a potion in their drink ' and make them your lover for eternity . so many people don't have lovers ... not everybody has married their lovers ...not everybody will ..you either marry by compromising your needs or you stay single life.</h1>
<p>japan has come to this point just now but americans had started that ages before . staying single ..having pets , denoting their life to animals , orphans or finding peace , adopting kids and living life as single unmarried parent ... but that doesn't stop misery . we shall have company of another human for two years , 3 years or 5 years ... or as far as two people can stretch  a relation . .. something is better then nothing .</p>
