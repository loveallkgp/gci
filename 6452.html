<p>Hi guys
Good to see this page back.Guys i want to share one prob wd u.
I am in relationship wd guy fr 5 yrs now.We are emotionally well attached to each other.But my bf hasnt been loyal to me since ur relationship.He himself used to tell me abt having sex wd some frnds.i used to feel very bad when i used to know dat but i liked his honestly and fact that he will change wd time.i had been completely loyal to him from last 4 yrs even though he was having fun wd his friends.but now from last 6 mnths i hv also started meeting ppl on sites and maybe i also will hv sex wd somebody sometime.Guys will dis relationship survive if we both are not loyal to each other.Pls help me out.I really love him a lot and dont want dis relationship to spoil.Pls guide me.</p>
<h1>GCI- If you both are okay with it, then no one can judge. If you both like each other and even after having sex outside your relation, with mutual agreement, you come down to home to live with each other, that's totally fine. If you have the feelings to continue with it, then do so. I am personally not a fan of this concept but to each on his own.</h1>
