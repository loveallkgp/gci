<p>22 New Delhi
I am fuckin virgin but on Diwali Night i cud have lost my virginity to one of my friend...
After celebrating diwali i returned back to my friend's place and skipped the idea of going back to my flat since it was ticking 1am...we guys went to sleep around 4:30 am and since there were only 2 beds which were already occupied me and one of my friend had to sleep on the floor on the same mattress....i hardly slept for half an hour and woke up all of a sudden realizing that i was trying to embrace him around my shoulders he wasnt even resisting....i was partially asleep and all these were happening like a fuckin nightmare then i fell asleep just to find that another minute he had embraced me as tight as hell and his feet, arms were all around me and... i turned towards him to see if he is awake bt cudnt figure out in the darkness bt while i was lookin at him our lips were like only two inches apart and i cud feel him breathe.... I was stuck for some moment...i even thought of kissing him bt i resisted it n only i know how......i turned my face away but he was still embracing me yet...i started shevring* like hell as i was damn nervous and excited at the same time...i had made my mind to go for it and start doing things......bt yes i resisted again and slowly n steadly i made myself away from his embrace....ahhhhhhh i felt relaxed....the next morning when i woke up i thanked myslef for not doing that cheap thing with a friend last night as he is quite straight and i know this since he has brought and fucked many a girls in his place....i wud hav been shattered had i have not controlled that night....as they also have got to know that i am a gay...
Thats it</p>
