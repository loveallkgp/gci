<p>Some gays ask why do others hate us and make fun of us. Well if you act like a freak, you will be treated like one. It has nothing to do with sexuality. People respect karan johar vikram seth etc bcoz they act like normal people and have acheived something in life. But people like Sushant are big zeros who act like freaks and spoil gays image by their behaviour on national tv. Look at the amount of hate and ridicule he has caused on every site and every discussion. Even nice people hate him. Some people here said hes very brave to have come out in public. Hello, if you are effeminate you obviously cant hide it. I hope he and people like him just go to hell so that society can accept us.</p>
<h1>GCI- I guess the world would do much better if the haters have their brains transplanted.</h1>
