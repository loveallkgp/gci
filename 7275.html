<p>One day in a gay cruising place, i met a guy He was muslim with a big dick. I sucked him, he was so smart macho man type. But suddenly he asked me to fuck him, i was abacked. I fucked him bitterly. He lost his heart on me. So do I, he proposed me on valentine. I asked him, about family, his job &amp; told me every thing. He was so kind, like ram ji. It feel suspicious, i cross checked, every thing was fake. I didn't told him, i thought maY be he is new in relationship, koi insecurity hogi. I asked him, he told me a new story which was more spicy but seems truthfull. I work in accounts. I use to be busy in office. One day, i was unable to remove my viberation of phone. As i forgot. He 39 times, then msg me that u r ignoring me, u lier, cheater, &amp; all that. Day before yesterday, i called him to meet in a park, two or three guys were there. One guy came near to me, asked time. I told him, at same time he entered in park. He started fighting that, i was wid the guy, even i was knowing that he is comming. He said I know that guy he is gay. U were taking line from him, u r cheater, he started abusing, even though i asked him &amp; requested that its not true. He said , i am a randi, mera kotha hai. &amp; all that. Actually, when u dont close ur internet , then u show online on facebook thru mobile app facebook lite. He said, u always remain online on facebook, tumhara ek se mann nahi bharta, tum sirf mere jism se khelna chahte ho &amp; all that bla bla bla. I slapped him, &amp; left. I cross checked his second story that was full fake. I blocked him on fb , &amp; mobile.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well done! next time don't come up with such confessions and remember u dealt with a 'macho drama queen' trying to prove himself ryt by pointing out that all gaymen are after lust and he will eventually end up marrying someone....these are luntaics charaded as humans...stay away from them!</h1>
