<p>I met a guy in a bus during my daily commute and we fell in love slowly. For 2 yrs we did evrything a couple does even take a trip to goa. I was open but he was still in closet and i was ok with that. We even talked about emigrating to a gay friendly country. He never showed any interest in girls or other men. It was going perfectly. Then one day it felt like he had started ignoring me. He kept saying hes busy. Then i saw on his straight profile he had changed status as engaged to so and so girl. I was shocked. He then said that he was confused earlier and hes bi now and wants to get married. I tried lot to convince him but he cut me off completely. I dont know what happened. It took me months to get over him and days of depression. I fell into a cycle of casual sex with whoever i met online. Recently saw he had married the same girl but his gay profile is still there. I sent him a congrats msg but he ignored that.</p>
<h1>GCI- Typical Indian problem. I don't understand why people make promises to brake them later. if you love then fucking carry it forward with all you got. Don't just hide behind the society and culture uselessly. I'm sorry for you buddy but everything happens for our own good. Maybe next time you will get a keeper.</h1>
