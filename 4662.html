<p>hello admin :) and members :)</p>
<p>i am studying in BBA 4th sem. i did HS in another state but now m in Kolkata with cousins. it has been 2 years. and i have very frank and close friends group.. 4 girls and 3 boys including me. i am straight acting gay. but the thing is that one of my friend is gay, i found this yesterday. i was unaware about this from last 2 years. still i am acting i don't know anything. n he knows that i came to know everything about him. from then he talks so in weirdly manner to me like he's uncomfortable even though i m talking like always. i don't want him to he gay and also i don't want him to know that i am gay but i think m doing wrong . :/ what should i do? if i tell him that he'll feel uncomfortable and even i will be. :/</p>
<h1>GCI- Why it will be awkward? I think you could talk more openly that you did before if you have that much of trust with each other. Two gay guys can be friends as well. It's not like gay people are just meant to have sex with each other.</h1>
