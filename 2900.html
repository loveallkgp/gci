i had a straight friend X in my school when i was in 12th standard. He had the cutest features and most amazing hair one could ever have. he was just like a kaamdev for me. Though we were in the same school since 8th standard but in different sections so never got a chance. my friendship with him started in 11th when we both met in a coaching classes where only we both were from the same school and none was familiar. Out of habit i initiated...he was pretty amiable and we were fast friends soon. He had sissy friend who was definitely gay but since school boys r not smart enough to notice that, he had figures on him. they were like besties till i came in the frame. </p>
<p>Reluctantly i started replacing him in X's life. But situations made him fall for me while i was having that soft corner for X. It became too complicated that there came a day when all 3 of us didn't wanna face each other. Final boards approached...........they both came up together wishing me to join the league again but i just didn't want the sissy in the scene so i refused to go back. ................During exams only i noticed that none of them was missing me or paying heed to my illness. I literally cried for him. But it was too late.....................exams got over and every1 left to the places i have no trace of........its been 4 yrs now.........i don't have any of them in touch either personally or through friends. Couldn't even find them on fb. I guess instead of using force.......i should have let them be.
.
.
Still feel for him</p>
<h1>GCI : i have seen many friendships getting broken like this. its okay if you didn't like the sissy guy , but if you liked X you should have atleast pretended to like him and spent some time with X .</h1>
<p>but its high school days . dramas are always their and so many old bonds are lost and new bonds are made in class 11th and 12th . </p>
<p>and i think you shall make a first step now to get close to your old friends . i mean you must have somebody from school live near your house or the same neighborhood. so try to meet him/her and get in contact with them on fb or whatsapp . try searching your school principles profile or some teachers profile .. they must be having somebody added from your classmates . </p>
<p>the last thing is ''popular students ''. try searching popular guy or popular girl of class on fb ....  the queen bee and the king ... its the fact all the boys and girls from school when they leave maker sure to add or follow these two creatures . </p>
<p>and once you meet don't try to do the same you did before . don't say sorry or don't confess things about past to any of them  chances are they never knew what were you actually doing those days . just be a friend , have good time and get busy in your regular life and spare your old crush .</p>
