<p>Everyone (with a very few exceptions) here who is vocal for gay rights, give advises to people, share their ideas etc. etc. have fake profiles...
Okay not that I am complaining or something.. but don't you guys think that if you as a gay guy cant reveal your real identity on this virtual world, how are you even supposed to stand up for good in your real life...
Such a hypocritical attitude we have!
and Then we say We are proud Gay... I wish even an ounce of it would be true.. !!</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, it's not hypocrisy and you shouldn't be too fast to judge someone. Everyone's condition is not the same. Some people may be proud with themselves being gay but have really conservative family. Some need time to figure their safety, both emotional and mental one. And just saying, I have seen people here who are okay with themselves, have their own pictures in their fake profiles.</h1>
