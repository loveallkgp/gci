<h1>GIC- Of course! Don't you see yourself getting manipulated? All those sweet talks "Oh i love you we will be together forever but behind the shadows" is sheer manipulation. He is playing with your head. You are a slave here. Why don't you make an effort to get out of it? He is saying to you that because of "society" you can't have a thing together so that you don't get up on his ass and ask him for a relation! All of his care is just a mere drama to use you. He will leave you for sure. Try moving out from the apartment and or don't fulfill his desires one day and you will surely see his real avatar. Fucking asshole that guy is. And instead of him you are at a bigger fault because you are getting yourself fucked everyday.</h1>
<p>PS- He is not straight if he gets intimate with you every night. He definitely not is. </p>
<p>PPS- I would tell his girlfriend about him if I were in your place. Yeah I am devil.</p>
