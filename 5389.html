<p>A little too high, A little too low.
Sometimes I wonder, this all you had to show?</p>
<p>A little too high, A little to low.
Never was it love, if only I had known.
Yes you are the one that walked away,
Leaving me shattered and nothing to say.
After 5 years of love and 5 years of pain,Its almost like 5 years of nothing but shame.</p>
<p>Hatred isn't bought nor can be forced upon,
Because true love is stronger than moving on.
Walk away in your own guilt of shame,
I never complained and yet I am to blame?
Because together we sat under the tree that day,
Only to break a heart and make it a child's play?
Like an ant falling down only to climb again,
As i never learnt to give people unnecessary pain!</p>
<p>'There is no such thing as god' they say,
You live more than 33 is what ill pray!
They come themselves and go away,
So that the one's like me can suffer today.
Its a mystery what got us apart,
As i just wanted to give you love from all my heart.</p>
<p>It was brief, it was young,
After 'teenage dream' comes 'party die young'
Never to kiss, never to hold,
This heart knows without you, its never too bold.
So here we are, lost in the track of the time the world lives in,
As ours was something i believed in!</p>
<p>Today ignored, tommorow forgotten,Its like a wound, healed but rotten,
Because within is a tender heart which was battered!
Your eyes tell a lot, your silence speaks it all,
Since you are scared, i am your shadow standing 10 feet tall.
To be with the present you,
To hate myself like you do,
To be ignored like you do..</p>
<p>Only because you walked away and I never stopped loving you</p>
