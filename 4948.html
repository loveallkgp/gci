<p>Happy new year everyone.. This new year brought me lot of new things in life donno good or bad. I'm in love with my best friend since 5years, everyone in college except him knows that I have feelings for him, it looked that obvious. We were so close to each other and I had no necessity to explain my love coz he always understanded me so well and gave me wonderful moments in his friendship. But on 31st night out of nowhere he suddenly said that he is in love with a girl and hez about to tell her, I didn't know what to say.. I just said what he wanted me to say. They are now in a committed relationship, all came so fast. I'm missing him so much since then, she's demanding a lot of his time and he's slowly showing back on me.. Problem is Just when I try to accept that it is universe at work and try to give up, he comes to me shares his beautiful feelings about our friendship and makes me feel like I mean a lot to him. Then the next day he again starts to hurt me. One night I got drunk and confessed to him that I'm missing him a lot lately after he got d gal. He never responded to that. He behaved as if nothing happened. I know very well that he needs me as his best friend, but it hurts like hell whenever I see him with that gal.. I feel like I'm stuck with this one sided relationship, what should I do now..</p>
<h1>GCI- He is straight honey, one sided relationship would do you no good. Better thing would be to just move on. Keep your friendship intact but feelings are something that are gonna destroy you. You have got to make your mindset that you cannot expect the same level of affection from a straight person.</h1>
