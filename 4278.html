<p>Hi everyone
It's me ami teacher by profession here I'm in a very complicated situation which I can't change even though I want to come out of closet . Things has changed now n I can't back off. I'm gay which I know since long back but I tried to be like straight which I couldn't make possible. I'm now married n have a son who turns 2 this month , I have a wife who doesn't know anything about it n loves me much , actually we had love n arrange marriage. But the problem is even though I love her n my sexual life for her is good ( not for me ) I'm not happy with it I mean I don't want to have sex with her . I even have bf who falls in different community ( punjabi) we met while traveling to Delhi he too is married n has 2 children . He loves me so much . We r in a relation ship from last 4 years before I got married . He was the one who told me to get married but when I got married he was the one who suffered a lot he came to our place which is 2 days travel from his home ( stayed in a hotel though) cried for the fear of losing me . We r in a distance relationship still going on n will be till our last breath . He often comes to see me n me too goes to him . But sometime I feel guilylty towards my wife .
I know everyone will hate me for what I did n will pass bad comments which I really don't care for I'm responsible to that. It's just I wanted to share it coz the place I belong is very small n rural area where people won't accept homosexuality rather u can say I'm being coward too much .
I even don't know I properly wrote it or not coz I'm so much confused that I'm not being able fram my story properly . Hope u guys can understand ! He knows my family n I know his . I do shopping for his children n wife n mom n he does for me . He does everything that a husband does n same goes from me . There isn't a single day that went without talking to eachother for 2 -3 times a day . He always cries while leaving . We have been to many places together ( ofcourse we lied back at home) . I love him n I care her . I love my son more than anything n his children too n he does the same .
I'm commiting crime here In this situation ?</p>
<h1>GCI- I am sorry that you have been going through all of this but know that you led yourself in this situation. One act of lie, and your entire future is in ruins. You both will never be happy the way you are living right now. Only if you had just taken the right step at that time., things would have been totally different.</h1>
