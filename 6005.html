But story changes  when he started to give my place to other frnd  n i doubted on him so one day i decided to be some intimate with that guy n it workd he took it casully but i was irritated from that day i was broken bcause my best fnd  cheated on me n it was confirmd ... i was  completly lost n i slaped him n decide never to talk him. But when i see both of them i really feel heartbroken n depressed i want to move on but how dont know plz suggest me .... </p>
