<p>Hi Guys. I want to share something serious today.
I met a guy for sex today from PR. I didnt liked his body as he was unhygenic and didnt do anything more than stripping him.After some time i asked him to go as i didnt liked him at all.He started demanding fare from me for coming to my place.I denied and asked him to leave.He opened the main door and dere comes his 2 more frnds who rushed into my room and started blackmailing me and asked me to pay Rs 3000 as they will shout and let my neighbours know about.They also showed me a pic of police inspector who was also involved wd dem.i convinced and asked dem to leave.But they sat on my bed and said they wont go until i give them money.I asked dem to call police as i havent done anything wrong and u are equally guilty u will also go jail for doing fun.They need to show proofs to make prove guilty for any gay sex.They softened as they didnt have any proof against me.They were 3 men so i felt helpless i gave them Rs500 and after long time they went.This experience has shattered my trust on people and made me feel so helpless.
I am sharing this experince so that nobody else go through this painful experience.Please be very cautious bringing ppl to your home.Thanks to indian govt for harassment we have to bear because of section 377 for ur freedom to have sex with men</p>
<p>Lastly Guys how could i have defended myself from this terrible situation.</p>
<h1>GCI- That is why this bloody law needs to fucking go! The threat is real!</h1>
