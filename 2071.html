<p>Hey there,
My name is Gurpreet. Am 27 years old, hail from a small village in Amritsar district. I am in Australia from last 3 years. I am confused about my sexuality. But that's not the reason am here for.
There is this guy at my office. He is quite cool guy. He is out and proud. I always wanted to have such peeps around me. The problem is that I am in the closet and without cing out my chances are zilch. Moreover, he is a Caucasian and am Indian and a Sikh. He likes my company and talks about gay people all the time. Most of my work colleagues (60% Indian) don't talk much to him 'coz he's gay. They even want me to stop having any converstaions with him. But I do like him and want to hang around with him. What should I do guys?
PS: Happy Pride Month guys. Hope you all are wearing the rainbow flags. Ciao</p>
<h1>GCI- Well he is quite open about himself and I guess he really don't give a damn to what others are saying. If I were in your place I really would listen to the colleagues and befriends with him. You can slowly open up to him and go clubbing and to other gay parties. Just like a friend. And if you find it compatible, you can start with a relationship.</h1>
<p>PS- And its the pride month already?! DAMN! HOW COULD I FORGET THAT?! Shame on me. :(</p>
