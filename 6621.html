<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Guys I want to share something and ask something at the same time. How many of you have actually shown the middle finger to homophobic bullies and have shoved their slurs and obloquies into their faces without any fear even if u did a bravado for such act??
It was one of my promises to myself that one day I will show the homophobic people their level in treating other people as shit and would force them to rethink on the word 'gay' they think understand.
Yes I have done the honours of the 'middle finger' after 2 years of constant verbal bullying, though even tried for a dialogue several times, but as they say that those who are deaf cannot understand acoustics and a blast indeed is necessary then.
For those who didn't get what I did, I will just say that I fear bullies no more, do u?!</p>
<h1>GCI- DO U?!</h1>
