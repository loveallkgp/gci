<p>hey adim its my first confession so first of all I would like to say that I like reading the posts that are posted here and most importantly I like the response that you give to those posts.</p>
<p>"Y it happens that after you break up your partner goes so far away from you that u just die to get a glance of him or to hear his voice once but you can't. Two bodies which were once one soul behaves as if they never met after being apart "</p>
<p>Falling in love is the best thing that could ever happen to someone and if it is with the same sex then u r an unique creation of god.In my lower grades I studied that same charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other.well lets leave it.
I am writing this posts coz I am not able to forget the moments (every second of it) that I used to enjoy being with him.I miss him a lot.hope he too is reading to it, whereever he is.
It was the starting days of the love month, yes "February," when Mark Zuckerberg's social networking site came lively.Like every normal day I got a friend request and before accepting it I just went through the profile to know more about the requester.It didn't contain catchy and heavy words to attract or to gain attention.The simplicity and clear content attracted me and I accepted it.I never thought that that one click would fill my heart with so much love that even today I find his face floating infront of me.while watching movies,seeing cute couples,in situations where he used to stop me,rain etc.I can see his smiling face,his eyes even today as I close my eyes.
We started chatting on fb first and after coming a little closer we shared numbers.The limit of texting from mobile was limited at that time and so we used to wait till the clock hits 12 and a new day used to start with endless msges till it hits it limit and we had to wait for a new day to start.Time passed or I can say tym used to fly when I used to be with him......</p>
<p>guys I will continue with my story later..hope you wont mind.</p>
