<p>i had sex 8 months ago.. n few days ago i got few problems like sweating, fever, skin problems, and getting wet by penis at anytime.. n even i lost my weight in few months.. i went to see a doc.. all he said this is HIV's symptoms.. so i got to get tested soon.. as he told i did and the result was positive..</p>
<p>i directly went to that and asked i have HIV since i had sex with him.. he said he get tested before our sex date and the reports were on pending but he got it after 2 days of our sex date.. even he became a victim of HIV. i was so depressed and felt like falling from 1000ft above and none is there to catch..
i told it to my parents, i came out as bisexual at the same .. and i broke my engagement too.</p>
<p>they cried alot and they got separated from me after giving my rights of property...</p>
<p>me already mar gaya hu.. ab jine ka man bhi nahi he..</p>
<p>i just wanna say to all people. please life is a very sensitive thing so take care of it very carefully. i just killed myself just coz of a hour for sex date. that single hour became the reason of my death. i wish i wasnt thirsty for sex that day.. i wish i should have used condom atleast.. that rs.5 worthy rubber stuff could have saved my life..</p>
<p>bye world. I'm just in this world for few days only. :( i dont wanna die .</p>
<h1>GCI- People can live with HIV also. If you start you medicines and take care of yourself properly, you can live. I read a story about man who was HIV positive, but he didn't loose his heart. He got married to a nice lady and even fathered a kid with the process of sperm washing. He is living a healthy life. Do not give up on life so easily. You made a mistake, okay. You cannot do anything about it but you cannot give up either.</h1>
