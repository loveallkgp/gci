<p>Hey all, i just wanted to share my daily fantasy ! :P</p>
<p>This is my routine before I fall asleep !</p>
<p>like every night in bed, i wanna wrap up my guy with one hand and one leg, like i am twined around him like a tendril around a stem, so that I can feel his warmth and hot and beautiful body with its own aroma mixed with deo. i dont wanna press his cock or anything, just his semi errect dick should be touched somewhere at my knee ( hope you can visualize the position :P ), In a dim lit light, in a cold, rainy night, which just started to snow, to get be warm enough, i just wanna feel like a baby near to him, as like he is my father, or i am a child and he is my guardian, a saviour who would protect me and "save" me from all the troubles and i am under his lovable custody ! in this position you could kiss only his cheeks ( as he is lying straight and i am lying to his side ) and this is what I love most, his cheeks, rather than his lips. I wanna listen to the bed time fairy tales toldby him, whil kissing his cheeks and caressing his face and hair, along with a kiss to his neck. I wanna hold him tightly so that no one would take him away from me and he praises me about how beautiful and loving i am while cuddling me and higging me tightly. I dont wanan move away from him, just wanna get dissolved into him. I just dont wanna exist anymore as i got dissolved into him, there is no seperate existence of me without him as "I" am no more ! In that position its natural to scent his armpit aroma and i wanna drench myself there, lay there and sleep there as that could be the safest place on earth. ! This way I could go to sleep daily and the same will be repeated in the morning for once. I wish this should happen for eternity and we should happily live ever after ! &lt;3</p>
<p>In the times of lonely niht, i am in need of your thoughts, my man :'(</p>
<p>Thanks for posting.</p>
