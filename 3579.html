<p>i m 26 I was in Temple and it was crowded. This another guy in 40s who was constantly staring at me slowly moved in front of me and started touching my Bulge. I thought it was by mistake as usually happens in crowed. i moved bit back. he again repeated, i moved back again. then he grabbed it, i was feeling uncomfortable as there was crowed and it was temple. so i moved back again.</p>
<p>Suddenly he inserted hands in my pants and started massaging my stuff. i was in shock as there was crowed and it was so unethical to do such things in place of worship. But being a Bisexual it was difficult for me to insult him publicly, so i was still for few seconds then it was non tolerable so i suddenly pulled his hand out and moved bit away . he again tried to do same but i didn't allow.</p>
<p>But i had a erection in the temple and i hate myself for that as it was me who didn't react at right time. feeling guilty..</p>
