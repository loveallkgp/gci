<h1>GCI- I really don't blame the parents because that how they have been brought up in the well defined society with a set of rules. So if you want to live differently, you have make an effort for it. Its sometimes true that parents can guess what their child goes through but in most of the gay kid cases, they do not. Its you who have to make them understand about yourself one day or the other, otherwise there will be another girl at your doorstep very much soon.</h1>
