<p>is pre-martial sex a bad thing?
i thought about this a lot and i feel it's not, if two adults/teenagers consensually induldge in a sexual relationship, than it's not a bad thing but i can't understand people who give virginity such a high importance, why people consider sex still a taboo in our society? so i am in my late teens and if i love a guy and consensually do sex with him, i think it's not a bad thing, right?
now about hetrosexual relationships, first of fall i think parents may counsel their child not to induldge in sex at such early age but even if their child do so , then instead of keeping that thing in mind and criticising their child , they must forgive him/her atleast for once, even if somebody's daughter gets impregnanted at early age, then instead of beating your child, parents should forgive her and must not force her to abondon her baby or abort fetus if she doesn't want to.
i want today everybody to write their views on pre martial sex and teenage pregnancy.</p>
<h1>GCI- Many things can be said over this. If two consenting adults are comfortable in having sex with each other, they should do it as it is their own decision. Now where things like teenage pregnancies happen is because of the lack of sex education. Teenage guys and girls being totally driven by new changes make wrong decision when they don't even know about the repercussions. And no one comes to teach them about protection, safety and contraceptives. In today's world hardly anyone is virgin before marriage. In gay people virginity is a lost cause, I believe. Its all about being properly educated whether it is done by teachers or parents or both.</h1>
