<p>Hi Admin,</p>
<p>I am in a state of confusion right now. I love a guy but he is straight, before even I had confessed my feelings to him, he had sex with me 3-4 times(he initiated everytime) but that's not my concern right now. Post these 3-4 times, something weird started happening, whenever I would sleep next to him I would initiate these acts while I am asleep. To me, it was happening in my dream but I was assaulting that guy in real and this was an issue since that guy didn't want to have sex with me after 3-4 times because he is straight.</p>
<p>Not just him but even two other friends of mine have made fun of me saying that i was hugging them while sleeping, which gets really embarrassing. I have read about this sleep disorder-sexomania but I am not sure if I have it or not. For a long time after that, I used to be scared when sleeping next to anyone. Now, I generally avoid sleeping next to anyone.</p>
<p>Has anyone else faced this issue as well?</p>
