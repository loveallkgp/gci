<p>Hi, I am writing for the fourth time with a hope that this time you will post my confessions. I dunno why, the admin is so averse in posting my confessions. Anyways, this is the fourth try and being an optimistic man, I hope that it will be posted this time.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was returning from Ranchi to Kolkata in Hatia Howrah Express. The train starts at 9.30 in the night and reaches Kolkata at 6 in the morning. I was sleeping but got up at around 3 post which I was unable to sleep. So, I decided to go and stand at the gates. Since the route of the train is not very good, the train is usually full of policemen and that day, the policemen were at the gates. I was standing at the gate but they said that I sud sit at my seat instead of standing at the gate. I told them I was not at all sleepy and that I was not able to sit at my birth, it was damn congested. In the same breath, I asked them if I could sit with them. The made space for me but the space was constricted, so to get in, I had to kinda sit close to the policeman and I took advantage of the situation and kept my hand on this guys's thigh making him instant horny. Eventually it led to a blow job in the bathroom.</p>
<p>While the blow Job was decent, the after math was not at all decent. This policeman colluded with another policeman and started blackmailing me... Asking me for a "gift" else they will tell their senior and I might be jailed for getting indulged in a sexual activity in trains. Idiot though he was, he tried to convince me that I should give them some thing special like the contact of a girl whom they could fuck and be their call-girl supplier.</p>
<p>It was horribly frustrating but i wasn't an idiot. I knew from the way they were talking that they were bluffing. But that's not the point! The point is that I want you guys to beware of the policemen. Even though they appear to be hot, they might be of a foul mind and might end up doing something much more horrible. So, before getting physically intimate with a policeman, please be sure that you are not going to get into trouble because of them. I tried this because I had previous experiences where the policemen took a blowjob and were more than satisfied. But these guys were just nightmares. Nothing more!!</p>
