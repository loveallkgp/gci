<p>I m the same who hv Shared my problem in #5807
Since few days i was thinking why he did this and what could be the reason behind it ...today i did call him and asked about....he said the same thing which i did imagine ...
Actually m sharing because i m.feeling bit deep 
One mature bi or gay man who is married ..successful in all aspects but living with a guilty tht he is betraying his wife ....he told me  she was the bestest gift he ever had ..
But he is bit depress because of somehow he is betraying more to her than he could do anyone else including me .....i framed him as a successful man ...he is successful but i thought he is perfect but he shared some of the problem with him which made me sad ...nd he was   crying on phone ...i love him very much as a frnd ..wish i could do anything for him..</p>
<h1>GCI- THIS IS Y I SAY THAT THERE IS NO PILLS OR PAGE TO TURN US STRT....</h1>
<p>Sex seeker or cowards...intellectuals or the loners...all have one thing in common- FEELING FOR GUYS!!!and that is what makes us gay...WE r neither masculine..nor feminine..nor even transminded..we are just GAY..and we have everything in us yet we cannot be categorised specifically..we can be segregated but not categorised in general!</p>
<p>Hony u need to do just one thing - EMPATHISE AND LEARN NOT TO FOLLOW THE PIT AS TO WHERE HE HAS LANDED AND LIVES...U WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE URSELF IN SUCH A PLIGHT!</p>
