<p>hi... I have a best friend. I just love him a lot , i means in terms of friendship and not in any other way. For me, He is everything.:) I am emotional guy and he is angry guy. He scolds me for silly reasons wic hurts me and den we both stop talking later. But within 2 days I go to him and apologize even though mistake is done by him coz I cant leave without his friendship. He cares me a lot. Since I am too soft, Everyone taunts me and crack joke on me, but He is the only guy who wont speak ill about me and supports me whenever someone humiliates me :(. He is even ready to go against anyone just for my goodness. He is so sweet even though he is high in anger. I just treat him more than a friend and less than his wife , and he loves tat care from my side coz he is deprived of friend care in his life. Even though all equations between us are mathematically correct, I have started feeling something is incorrect between us . I feel I am betraying him by keeping away my true self ( GAY). He is straight and he has told each secret of his life with me. I have approached him many ways and tried saying him my identity , but he couldnt able to get abt my gay being. He says I am joking and asks me to change the topic...In recent days , I strongly feel , I am not worth being his friend . I am not supposed to be with such a nice heart coz i am not true to him. This thought makes me haunting daily. I have decided to end our friendship coz If i am not der wid him, he may feel alone for few days but later he wil get more true friends. But later if he comes to know my identity, he may get shattered coz of me hiding such a big truth from him .  I dont want to be a foe by hiding my true self and at the same tym I cant reveal my identity coz he has high respect and greatest place for me in his heart.. Coz my gay emotions towards him even though its for friendship is more or less than what a girl shows to her boy friend.. I dont want to him to feel awkward or repented for being my friend .. And no where I cant control my over emotions 4 him.. So...I have made my heart a stone for time being ..and ...I have started avoiding him intentionally .. I have started hurting him for no reasons.. I have started being mean .. I am just doing all these coz I want him to develop hatredness towards me and so that he ends our friendship.. I know, he definitely gets more true and straight friend in future.. I just want to c him happy for ever.. I feel killing myself wen i do these against my heart... but for his well being I need to do this...#LOVE U FRIEND 4 EVERYTHING U HAVE DONE ME.. BUT PLS PARDON ME if u Can COZ I AM NOT WORTH FOR UR TRUE FRIENDSHIP..  </p>
<h1>GCI- Honestly, some secrets shouldn't be allowed to be kept inside. Its unnatural. You want your friendship to end? Just say the goddam truth on his face and end it right then and there only. Do not fake hatred and leave him his melancholy for the lifetime by having an unspoken truth. Effing sacrificers always think that they can be bigger persons by leaving their bfs or leaving their friends for the greater good. A reality check honey, IT IS NOT FOR THE GREATER GOOD AT ALL! What they deserve is your part in their life! Why is it so hard to comprehend? DAMN!</h1>
