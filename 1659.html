<p>hi,
this query is for a friend. (this is a bit long, but i want you to know th whole scenario)</p>
<p>So my friend came out to his parent as gay. And they took him to a psychiatrist the following day.
The Questions he asked,
1. Do you have a functioning set of balls?
2. Do you have sex with men?
3. If you do, do you assume the role of a man or a woman?
4. Do you ever want to change your gender?
5. If you are assuming the role of a woman, why don't you want to change to a woman?
6. Why do I assume both the roles?
7. If I had any previous relationships, who was the "female" in the relationship, "Because no two people can live in a relationship if both are assuming male roles".
blah blah blah.</p>
<p>his parents were determined to change him.
He came back to bangalore. And never went back home. His parents once visited him. (not to his house, they dont know where he lives, he says he feels more secure without them knowing).
They took a room in a hotel and asked him to come there. There the father beats him. In that attempt he tears his shirt. My friend pushes the dad away and ran out. ( he is much stronger than his dad, but he didnt want to hurt him). Later the dad gives threatening calls. saying he will kill him n all.
months passed. Now the dad visits his office and is threatening him there. He works in a pvt company and his job may be at risk. The dad is saying he is going to kil himself in front of the office.
but i dont think he will suicide n all becz he loves himself too much to do so. But my friend is all nervous. He doesnt know how to end this relationship. All the talkngs are going in vain</p>
<p>I dont really know what to tell. I need some legal advice.</p>
<h1>Viv- Okay first of all the psychiatrist questions made my blood boil. Indian psychological association has said that homosexuality is not a disease and still this STUPAD psychiatrist want to get on with this pathetic stuff. Can someone sew his mouth please? You want some legal advice? Go to Lawyers Collective. Its an NGO run by a group of lawers based in delhi that specifically helps for gay people who are in the need of legal protection. I don't blame your friend for breaking up the relation this easily but also he has to understand why his dad is creating all the drama. In the end he cares for him. Ask your friend once to meet his dad and make him understand one last time. If you can accompany him, the better. After that if he still is not able to understand, then by all means your friend can do anything he wants.</h1>
