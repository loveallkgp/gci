<p>Hi admin.
I am sorry. I just feel like saying so. You'll realise as you read more why I feel so guilty.
I am a gay, so is my friend (person A) and another person (person B). A&amp;B are actually in a relationship. There was one day when A invited me to hangout with him and his boyfriend. There, In CCD I saw them together, I sat with them and A told B to find a boyfriend for me because I was still single. Then I looked at B. His was fare, perfect hairstyle. He was in Pink shirt and jeans. Even in pink he looked so manly. It wasn't lust this time. If it had been so, I wouldn't have felt something active in my chest but at groin. We kept looked at each other for a long time His eyes, he was sooo perfect (sorry, if I'm bein' too cheesy). For rest of the day I thought of Mr.B. I thought of him with me on my bed, cuddling and kissing me (but not having sex with me). I waited after many days to get a chance to meet him but in those several weeks, I realised that at day he looked in my eyes quiet a lot of times (although, this memory just could be a creation of mine, I'm not sure). I'll keep short from here. I dd get another chance fo meet him and we socialized more in second event. After a year, In the 11th event, when A was out of town, he texted me on facebook that he was alone, can he meet me to talk. we talked at park and then...when it was time to leave, I held him and confessed my love. It was Isolated, I held him, he was manly but his physical build was medium, not that huge. I hugged him and told him to hold me. He did so and I kissed him (on his cheeks for few minutes). After he trued leaving me but I still held him.
Mr.A came and things were again on their straight track. we met few times. I finally got another chance to be alone with him. In 24th event, I asked him...what his thoughts are. He won't speak. I held him and kissed him. He ddn't protest. This may seem weird but I told him that I want to do sex with him. We went to his place but we just kissed each other and nothing else. It was then I realised that he actually looked more handsome and his skin was soft. we kissed for a long time. In 31st event, he told me that he's in love with me. Insteas of appreciating him, I asked him why isn't in love with A. It happened like this that A &amp; B had started dating just a 3 weeks ago before the first event and instead of developing feelings for him, my interruption made him to develop his love for me. Some of you may say that what I did is a stupid thing and I've ditched my friend but I just couldn't control my feelings. Ijust couldn't stop myself to love him. We both are in a relationship. I really love him. That day we went to his home . He saud this 100 times that he cannot live without me. After we had sex, yes ! it was painful for me. when it was time to leave , he told me that he can't live without me. he told me to stay with him and whole night (till the time I was asleep) he kissed me,my cheeks and my neck.
I am sorry that Mr. A will soon realise and may get deeply hurt but I fell in love with B and I couldn't stop myself. As you say, love doesn't see any gender, race etc. In my case , it didn't see how badly my friend will get hurt. Some may also say that same thing may happen to me, the person whom I love may get stolen by someone else. I'll simply accept it as a punishment. Mr.B told me once that he too felt something for me when I met him for first time and he realised that I am his destiny.</p>
