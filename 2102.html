<p>My boyfriend is a photographer, he majored in photography from a good college, so he works for a popular magzine (GEO magzine) and i am a phd. Studet (adolescent psychology). I feel lonely eveeytime, my boyfriend has to go to different countries to get best shots, since it's a science magzine, he has travel to lot of countries exploring world science through his camera and he comes to india once in a half year. I miss him a lot but we can't talk everytime, everyday because it's a all time job, sometimes he is busy all day, waiting for hours to capture best moments, he sends some money and letter and tells me to work hard on my research, i wish if i was in his arms every moment.  I don't know that when will get time for each other. We haven't had sex for 2 years and he loves me a lot, he says that during his trips, i am the only person he thinks about . Sometimes, out of desperation, i wish if he was not a photographer. </p>
<ul>
<li>I wish if i was his camera, he and his hands around me all the time*</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I miss you</em></p>
<h1>GCI : are you kidding me.. so he is like 'wildlife photographer' . that's good .. i want a photographer bf :p ..or maybe anyone from creative field .  anyhow you have to manage things... career doesn't last more then 2 , 3 years ... its just he is young and that's why he has so much work load . after few years when you two will decide to marry he will be able to give you time.</h1>
