<p>Today im travlling through Haryana Roadways with my frnds..i saw two very cute guys sitting to next each other...They seems to be very fancy &amp; over dressed up guys &amp; holding each others hand...so everyone looking at them at time to time..so thts they r nt feeling comfartable there I think...............but sad thing starts when some stupid villagers dumb guys come on the bus &amp; starts making fun of them..they start touching one of the guy &amp; start putting jokes on him but those two guys doing nothing.....im feeling very sad&amp; angry at tht time....but im with my frnds :( my frnds also seems to enjoying whole tht episode......which made me realize is this is the cost which we have to pay if we come to open in the society!!! i personally think unko apne lie stand lena chaie tha...!!! Wat u think guys??</p>
<h1>Viv- It is entirely the blame of the society here that it makes fun of people who are a bit different or in a way kind of weak. They couldn't have done anything because they were already outnumbered(that's my guess). Moreover it is the cheap mentality that we have. In a country where a rape victim is targeted more than the rapist, where girls are labeled as sluts because of some short clothes, where brides are tortured and killed because of dowry, what good can we expect from the heartless society towards us? This one has just saddened me.</h1>
