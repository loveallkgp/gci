<p>Abby i appreciate your reply n thnx for it, but never thinks that all gay are same. And, It doesn't means that a student gay is free and a working gay is busy, and he is tired in evening after office. Working from 9am to 5pm doesn't makes a man tired, and if it makes him tired then after some rest he can have time. And, student also have his college from 9am to 5pm n then he has homework to do.
If there is love exist, then time can be manage. and it's nothing to do with insecurity,  and on call or chat it's not to telling him the whole day stories.</p>
<p>If two lovers can't share there talks, if he doesn't want to talk to his lover bcoz he is tired, if he is not finding 5mins in 24hrs just to check whether everything is ok or not, then It is not love.</p>
<p>Mr. Abby don't be always logical, life can't lives on logic.
And that's why in gay life there is no value of emotions.
Keep hunting my frnd
wound love to see ur logical reply too</p>
<p>$abby : well i have 3 hours of college and i come back and feel like dying on bed .. i don't know how your man can't be tired of working shift . 9 to 5 . and i am not judging but i haven't heard somebody died of 'homework ' ... though i know mental burden is there .. but student life and working life is hell lot of different . 
and i also said that you two can physically meet on weekends and give each other time . calling is ' emotionless , feelingless' way of connection . 
anyhow that's just a simply my view and i always say to keep looking down in 'comment section ' as readers sometimes have better things to say and suggest . i am not a counceler and not studying human psychology and not a professional in ' problems in gay life' and not have seen it all in the world . </p>
<p>note : abby can be wrong :)</p>
