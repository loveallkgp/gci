<p>Hi guys, this is not really a confession, just letting out some steam, I dated an older guy for almost 8years and we broke up due to him cheating on me with someone younger. I am out of the closet, been out since I was 16, I'm 27 turning 28. My parents are so amazing as they just love the whole gay scene. Dad even goes clubbing with me. Its been awhile since I've been single but I can't seem to find a guy. I think because of me being in a relationship for so long I've become the settled type. I am very comfy in my own skin so I'm somewhat fem and very proud. My problem as well is that gay men tend to want the "straight acting" sort and my Dad told me to never compromise my self image for any man. So well yeah that's my story, I'm from South Africa, I've studied , I got a great job as a specialist within the bank. Now alls that missing is someone to come home to. *sigh, I feel so down :( I just wanna be loved that's all...</p>
