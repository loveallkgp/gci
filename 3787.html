<p>hello everyone...this is a scientific stuff which i think everyone of us must know...i dnt know how many of you will understand..but still ... i felt like sharing..i m gonna say about some homosexual stuff strictly based on science...
FACTORS CONTRIBUTION TO HOMOSEXUALITY
1-GENES PROBABLY NONE
2-HORMONAL INFLUENCES SOME
3-BRAIN STRUCTURE PROBABLY NONE
4-CHILDHOOD ABUSE SOME
5-FAMILIAL ENVIRONMENT SOME 
6-'EPIGENETICS' UNKNOWN(under research)
7-CHOICE/PREFERENCE SOME
Thus going by the first factor it is understood that homosexuality is not discovered on the bais of genetics and heredity but still is there in our genes(but where is not known exactly)...it is the expression of genes..but no gay gene have been confirmed..though the XQ27 chromosome region is still under question..NUTSHELL -under research..
hormones playing the vital part of our sexual behavior seems to provide a clue but is just the factor of the cause not the ROOT CAUSE..
brain structure of gay men is physiologically like men and women both...functioning like women and executing like men or may be not....so its a mixture..but do not tell us as to y we are gay..
childhood abuse can be associated with repeated human behaviour over the period of time where the victim no longer identifies itself as the victim but a perpetrator of or a chain of what happened with him....SUMMARY-no one can become gay from its sexuality by child abuse but can act gay and can enjoy in terms of having gaysex...
familial environment can be said to be hereditary(habits,diseases etc) or not to be herditary...and thus it is assumed that familial environment where family members indulge in homosex can prompt teenagers to act accordingly but it is still considered that homosexuality is not exclusive to familial environment and one doesnt turn gay in a same sex family or vice versa ...
epigenetics is the study of proteins on a particular gene and thus is under extensive research to determine the sexuality of a person..
lastly choice and preference applies to people with fluid sexuality and thus all the chaos and pandemonium regarding sexuality arises..SCIENTISTS STILL ARE NOT ABLE TO GET TO THE ROOTCAUSE OF HOMOSEXUALITY OR TRANS SEXUALITY ETC..which gives a fair chance to the ignorants and religious fanatics to concrete their ILLOGIC stand on sexual moral conduct..
BASED ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DOCUMENTARIES ON SEXUALITY..
I HOPE I MADE IT CLEAR GUYS..</p>
