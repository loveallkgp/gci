<p>Iam from Hyderabad, doing my Masters first year. I came across an intriguing person from another branch in Masters. he's so cute... i really want to befriend him... may be i am in love with him. I support my attraction towards him because when ever i came across him, i always felt a heart thump. I really want to get close with him... just want him closer to me and myself closer to his heart. I want to directly talk to him but i feel its very much difficult for a person like me... and more over it can lead to an unpleasant situation if doesnt like gays... and i would lose my any furture chance even to meet him.</p>
<p>The problem here is that we are from separate branches of technology so wont have a chance of meeting often... adding to it is that no classes are held for masters in our college... so i have a chance of meeting him only when we have exams. Presently our first semester exams are going on (only two exams left now). probably it might take another 6 months for our next semester exams to start. I cant wait so long to talk to him. I am so desperate now. but cant even show my desperacy by approaching him suddenly and talking some nonsense.</p>
<p>I am his friend on a social network but didnt talk to him till today. Today i almost was very close to him but still was unable to start some conversation and instead of starting a coversation i turned my face away as long as i was near him.
FRIENDS PLEASE SUGGEST ME SOMETHING ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH HIM DIRECTLY.</p>

<h1>Viv- Aah! Love at first sight.. that feels awesome.. ^_^ You should be careful while approaching him. Get to know if hes straight or not. If he is, then honey you gots to move on.. Just befriend him firstly. Talk to him about the usual stuff. Become his close friend and when you think he is trustworthy tell him about your feelings. Maybe he could share your feelings. But in all of this, be careful to not jeopardize your career.</h1>
