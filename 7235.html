<p>Hello guys.
Some thrash report decades ago showed/assumed that 10%of people are homosexuals. Rest are heterosexual. And we still believe that. How pathetic.
Can't we early see that the number of heterosexual people the society claims to have is just hoax?
In fact, what the reality is that if we draw a conclusion for real, we have
10% Homosexual and ONLY 10% Heterosexuals. Rest 80% people fall in between, i.e. Bisexuals ( and u can use numerous other labels out there which is not my focus here). Now mostly due to our dear homophobic society, mostly bi guys try to suppress their guy-liking part and live a hetero-life.
Why I am writing this is coz mostly even us gays think that we are minority. When in fact, its the so called Heteros who are in minority and the majority comprises of non-hetero people who are for some reason (pointing fingers to religious suppressions) too afraid to make a move as they think they are wrong or weak or minority.
Get it straight guys, gays ( or say queers) are NOT less in number. At least WE have to believe in the fact.</p>
