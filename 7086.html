<p>Hello guys, hope u all r doing well. Its been a long time n i m back again wid yet another confused situation. Ur comments and suggestions have helped me a lot b4 n hope it will continue. So, d thing is i m attracted to a straight guy in my clg. He is too hot n handsome and grls r crazy for him. I knw there is very less chance of me being wid him in future. I hv tried many times but i failed. Every tym i see him i fall in love wid him all over again n every tym i see him close wid a grl i die all over again within. I try staying away n ignoring him but i can't hold it aftr a certain point of tym. I go back again to get hurt. Such an idiot i m. I just wanna forget him. I wish i hv never met him. I never wanted to fall in love wid him but i failed to control my feelings. If only i get a spell to forget him n his memories. I need to go away frm him but can't leave my course incomplete. Don't knw wat to do. How to get rid of my feelings for him. If only he was gay. I want to fall in love wid a gay version of him. If only dat was possible.. :-( :-( Sorry guys for taking too long. Just wanted to take dese out frm my mind.. Ur suggestions r highly required.</p>
<h1>GCI- Join the camp of PRAY THE GAY AWAY!</h1>
<p>And for the spell I have one in my 'Book of 1001 Gay spells'.
Its 'Gayga expellere'.
Suggestion- U can suggest strt cure therapy to him or u can send him to Homoland.
Possible solution- Get a gay cousin of his to drink ur potion of love with!
Taaa daaa!
There u have all ur solutions in ur pocket!</p>
