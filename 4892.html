<p>I'm really in love and the strange thing is that the one I love is not a girl..!!!! Yes its a boy... Am I gay or bisexual...?? I can't be straight coz a straight man is not attracted towards another man..
Well I have hugged him, kissed him, I had it all with him but the thing that confuses me about him is that does he love me or he just do this for recreation .. Its confusing coz he has a girlfriend and he says that he loves her a lot which I also think is true coz I have seen him crying stealthily for her.. Well my life has come to a point where I myself don't know what I should do... Should I bury my feelings for him in myself or should I tell him what I feel for him ...?? If I tell him about my feelings it may put an end to our friendship and I don't want that to happen...
You tell me what should I do..??</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, complicated situation. Answer yourself some questions.</h1>
<p>1) Will he truly be yours?
2) What will happen if you deny him sex?
3) If by any chance, he leaves his girlfriend to be with you, would it last long considering he now has a girlfriend and has sex with you?</p>
<p>Don't be somebody's object. That's all I want to say.</p>
