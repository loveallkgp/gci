<p>Hey,
I found this guy on instagram who DM'd me and we started talking. When I entered the talks that were with a little flirtatious banter, I kind of established at the back of my head that it wouldn't be anything serious. Gradually I figured he's a broken soul, to which I decided that I'd help him get stronger by giving him the moral support and being there for him.
Yes he did fall in love with me and I only pretended I loved back. Gradually, I fell for him too.</p>
<p>Technicalities - we exchanged WhatsApp. He only sent offline pictures. From instagram etc. After adding me on Snapchat I asked him to snap me but he never did. We always had quarrels over video calling. Then once, he deleted his Instagram, and asked me to make a new one. The new one also got closed because of 'impersonation of another entity.' (Upon questioning he claimed his friends posted porn there)</p>
<p>Now this happened two days ago when he started sexting me. After the session I asked him to send me a live selfie and he denied. Upon pestering, he eventually did, an offline one. </p>
<p>I got suspicious and I examined the pic he sent to me of the time when he was 5, it didn't look anything like him. Then on his IG I found a follower who's face EXACTLY matched that baby picture. </p>
<p>I facebook stalked this follower (my guy had 6 followers btw), and found that all the details- his birthday, nickname, everything matched this person. I had found my guy on fb before and the "so called profiles of his friends and himself" appeared 100% fake. Only 6 friends, in each of them.</p>
<p>Now, lastly in doubt I truecallered his number and GUESS WHAT? It matched the follower.</p>
<p>Borderline- my guy is impersonating someone who is apparently not in this country and don't know who. Impersonation is not a problem and I could leave him. He has pictures and information. Also, upon confrontation, he backed on the argument that I always do this and he will present proof and shit. </p>
<p>My confession ends with a question, how do you cope with this impersonation? Are there laws against this? 
And how do I go about it?</p>
<p>(PS- Is it crazy if I want to know, just speak to the guy he impersonated? I could share a picture through this portal if you feel it's ethically okay, I just really want to.)</p>
