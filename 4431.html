<p>Hi guys this is vicky here.... I have a very common doubt like guys of my age have when they have feelings for guys. Yes it is I like guys very much wen it comes to intimate relationship. I dunno wat to call it. I can even call it gayish but the problem is I like girls too bcas I have been with girl surrounding since my childhood.... but wen it comes too feeling I like to be with guy and it's feels comfortable... but I haven't been in intercourse with a girl yet... I like oly guys wen it comes to sex. Also I have a lot of friends of both gender but never felt for a girl. But I like to be with a girl oly like a friend and nothing else. But wen it comes to a guy I like to be more than just a friend. Pls admin and frnds give me a clear picture in this.</p>
<h1>GCI- Being gay doesn't mean that you have to shun the girls out of your life. I haven't I like them as friends. But I can't have them for something more. You sir, are gay because whatever you said are signs of being gay. Welcome to the rainbow family!</h1>
