<p>Hey!! I have been reading many confessions here.</p>
<p>What I want to tell is not a confession but I just wanted to share my feelings.</p>
<p>I met a guy on Omegle once (Lets call him Mr A). Nothing hanky panky happened though :). We became good friends and had and even have now good chats on Whatsapp. It was like I started developing feeling for him but he considered me as a friend and brother. We would share everything with each other and I would advice him on his future. This happened for some 2-3 months. Phir, the frequency decreased and his responses became cold. One day, he told me, he met another guy (Mr X) on Omgele, he met him in a mall by chance one day and then they had a date the next day as the other guy (X) was leaving for further studies and forever. They used to have chats and the same happened with Mr A, Mr X reduced the frequency of chats and would not reply to him. This is what Mr A shared with me. I felt bad and happy at the same time but Mr A clarified to me that I will still remain a brother for him.</p>
<p>There is a twist in the story :P.
When this Mr A was not talking to me. I met another guy Mr R on FB. We had long video chats and would chat for long. He belongs to film industry or whatever and is kind of a rich guy. He is being offered for modelling as well. I have a feeling for him as well. I don't know what he thinks of me. He still pings me and we do chat. But he do not want to disclose his phone number etc. to me and we chat only when he pings me on FB. I have shared my real FB id with him but he pings me with his fake one. I have seen him and it's not like I don't trust him but it becomes kind of weird. Moreover, I am an engineer, earning a decent money but not obviously upto his standards. I am kind of feeling that even though he feels for me, it won't work out. We are planning for a casual meet in August when he is back from NY. He has assured me that all my questions will be answered when we will meet.</p>
<p>I don't think anybody would be able to comment on this. But what I feel is if it doesn't work out with this Mr R, I won't be trying ever again.</p>
<p>Thank you for being patient and going through my shitty life story :)</p>
<h1>GCI : you know its obvious to create feeling to a person who has been chatting with you and listening to your shit all the time . all of sudden when someone starts listening to us we get attached to them . in this age chat messages , video chats , long calls are they way to connect with people but are total misleading . like the thing with mr A who might have been lonely guy and just added you to increase his social circle and when he met mrX  his contact with you decreased which is so obvious .</h1>
<p>and again how can you be so sure of mr R who said to you that he is model ( or offered for modeling )  and he is super rich . he just video chats with you but never said he likes you or he is gay ( you haven't mentioned if he is gay) . its one sided love . secondly a rich guy who is model will have high expectations . he want to be more rich , he will go for a guys who can provide him luxury , career .  ( which is my thinking ) . plus how can you be so sure that he is so rich . and he can video chat with you but can't give you his fb id  ( knowing the fact that you can record the video chat too) . </p>
<p>ok leave that .. i would like to suggest you to get real and be very clear to people what you want and don't chat with people expecting they will fall for you all of sudden .</p>
