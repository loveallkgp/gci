<p>Hello frndz! I am in a big confusion. I am a 19 yrs old bi guy. I love my gf more than anything and my bff(boy) too. They both love me so much and have trust on me. I love both of them equally. I can't cheat with anyone. My bff knows about my gf and he doesn't have any problem with it. My gf also knows my bff but she doesn't know about our relationship. They both are good friends of each other. If i tell my gf about our relationship i don't have any idea what she will do. Might be she'll take it casually or may be my life will become hell. I can't live without her. I don't wanna loose her and i don't wanna cheat her too. Help me frndz, what should i do now? should i tell her the truth or cheat her by hiding the truth. I really need your help frndz.</p>
<h1>GCI- Okay honey, first explain what type of relation you have with your bff? Bff means best friends forever and not boyfriend forever. Also, you cannot love both of them at the same time! That thing was possible in middle or early ages, or nowadays in porn. You should make the relationship with your guy friend as a platonic one. If you don't want to cheat then don't cheat.</h1>
