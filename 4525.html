<p>Hey Pals, I need a help !</p>
<p>I am so interested in a Sikh guy ! He is a wild life conservationalist and I simply love him for who he is and what he is doing. He is taking such a care on wildlife and nature, wow ! a sensible man.</p>
<p>The point is, how can I know whether he is gay ? I havent met him in person, just through facebook because of common interests.</p>
<p>And in a picture comment, when i said his offer to wild life meant so much to me, he replied like "You mean so much to me, eagerly waiting for me to take me to a wild life trip" I know he might have said in a friendly way, but just wanted to know, How should I take this ! How about Sikhs in particular ? If in someday, if I proposed him when I meet him in person, he should not slap me or cut my friendship.</p>
<p>I read in great detail about sikh theology about the religious teachings and gurus etc which is neither against not for towards homosexuality. I am asking general sikh people's opinion, notable sikh gay marriages, the discussions at home, etc</p>
<p>Oh my god, his beard and turban, his attitudes. killing me ! How does Sikh community views homosexuality ? Any familiar Sikh guy, give me some good idea !</p>
<p>I like him for who he is, for what he does. such a simple guy, but a wonderful man</p>
<p>Spoken to him over phone only once, he said He is not interested in marriage :P I didnt ask him why. And after the call i texted him like " what a wonderful man you are, couldnt speak to you properly because of the first call, love you hero !!"
he replied like "ha, ha, nice talking to you as well, i also couldnt speak properly as i was travelling". What can i conclude from this ?</p>
<p>I mean, I need him, at the least as a friend, such a rare man who thinks about nature and wildlife. i am sure i will be happy if I be with him. what to do people ? shall i propose him wgen i meet him ? please help me !</p>
<p>it pains if he calls me bro, it also pains if he didnt :( if i address he will address me the same way, if i didnt, he also will not :( </p>
<h1>GCI- Did I see butterflies? Don't go in a hurry. Enjoy the time with him first and then make sure that he feels the same for you. You have to be sure before you do love him. For now you have a crush on him. People easily mistake crush for love. Love develops slowly and let it develop slowly only if he is gay.</h1>
