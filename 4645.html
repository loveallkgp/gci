<p>Am I normal ? I react to few silly things , I can't understand what people talk .. Like I feel its complicated .. N my words are complicated to them too .. I can't judge anything my self now a days ...feeling dumb... I understand the things that's complicated to others, rather simples onces I usually fail.. For silly things , I guess I get depressed .. I don't feel to talk to other, either mingle with.. I just need a breath.. I'm smart, but not street one .. Tounge n brain doesn't sync I would say . ... I get depressed in a minute ... Lost my smiles years together .. Those were fluttery I guess , they weren't from inside ... I feel obstructed , somewhat , no reason , say if I don't want to do a thing , but no reason ... No reason , I fear or depressed , I feel that at my heart , I mean physically ... Am confused guy , what am I doing here ? That's fine ... Admin , pls don't joke, lol , I fear you troll..I myself don't know, am I seriously complicated ? Or what's going in my life ?? Tell me something ...... At last , I salute you admin !! The task you handle !! Im amazed to see you doing all these things .. Hope I realize your character in me :) XoXo</p>
<h1>GCI- Oh you rained on my parade. Pffff... I don't know, you are reacting too much. What you need is a feedback signal like whenever you are reacting to a situation which you term as silly, just think about it while it is going on and see if it is right or wrong. You woll yourself figure it out what to do.</h1>
