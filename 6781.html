<p>This one's basically not a confession but something I'd like to tell all of you, and mainly our dear Admin/s.(bit long post, sorry)
Ok so I saw some post from a Christian guy on this page and in response the Admin mentioned something 'bout Bible and how the religion doesnt exactly hate the gay people n all.
First of all I'd like to say that Stop Defending the hate of religion for gay people. It is indeed true that the major religions - be it Christianity, Islam or Judaism - they all HATE religion and want gays to be wiped out. It's factually true !!! Apparently God condemns us homosexuals. 
Now, its all up to people whether they want to follow the religion as it is or they want to discard it altogether.
Lemme tell u I am a Muslim and accepting the fact that I was a gay was as difficult for me as it must've been to any of u. Belonging to a community that hated people like me obviously never helped me and I ended up in self-loath and humiliation n sfuff. And rest of the story is similar to most of u - i dont need writing the complexities we people face, do I ?
Moving on, Now that I know that I am gay and I know I cant change this fact no matter how hard I try, I dont try to change no more. Well, No, I havent refrained from faith tho. I still believe in the Only God - Allah and his messenger Muhammad. I do everything a good Muslim is supposed to do. But at the same time I try to find some dude with whom i can spend my whole life peacefully and lovingly. I aint marrying a girl ever! 
I know my Lord states that if I engage in anal sex , I'll be hated. I know its a sin. But at the same time I have no control over it. So, Yes, I m ready to do the sin .I know the consequences it might have on me in the afterlife but that doesnt stop my life. I'm ready to And anyone questioning my faith , I will question his!
I want to tell all of u that Please note that Religions do Hate Gays. Dont mend things just to console ur hearts. But then again some say Religions r bullshit coz they dont accept gays and thus religions need to be boycotted. I dont understand why just looking at part of religion u guys decide to dicard the religion altogehter. Religion teaches numerous good things - its a way of living. If u dont want to believe in certain part of it then dont. But there r other good parts that u'd want to keep. So just be sane ...use ur mind. Do what You feel right; religion's a guide.</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, keeping the religion aside, as it is not the only truth in the world, nor is sex, if you do any harm to anyone that's when you do a sin. Two consenting adults who are engaging in some activity can never be a sin. However, to each on his own. I personally don't like religion telling me how and where to use my body. When people wrote those books, they were written according to the beliefs of those times and over the years they have been interpreted according to the beliefs of people who did it. Now the time is different and we are living in the free thinking world where we have much more knowledge than believing in angels, heaven and hell and all that jazz. Try to think out of the box and be not feared to question.</h1>
