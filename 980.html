<p>I am 27. He's 24. He's goodlooking and smart, I am not. He's talented, I am too.. But, the worst thing is that he's arrogant, straight, homophobic.. And to make it even worse, I am madly in love with him.. Both of us work in the same company.. Both of us joined here recently.. I met him in October.. Started chatting with him since November.. Gradually started falling in love with him from December to February.. Couldn't hide my feelings from him as his unintentional touch used to make me go crazy.. He wanted a medical bill and I produced it for him, fighting with my childhood friend, who's a doctor now.. He wanted to change his job and I sent him a mail regarding a job opportunity which he was looking for.. Unfortunately, he wasn't selected.. All this time, he was very comfortable with me.. Since the day I told him that I am madly in love with him, even if I knew that he may even thrash me, his behavior changed.. He now started talking to me only when it was work related.. Since beginning, he used to say insulting things about Maharashtrian food, Mumbai as a city, Mumbaikars and Mumbai's youth.. But, I controlled my anger and I didn't say a word.. After I told him that I love him, once it happened that he only started the topic of section 377 and started talking things like how government has taken the right decision.. I was shocked and shattered by his statements so much so that throughout my journey back to home, I was crying.. After that I almost stopped talking to him.. But, he would behave normal with me one day and next day, he would unnecessarily argue over anything which I would say and to which he needn't even respond.. Meanwhile, something that shouldn't have happened, happened.. I got a certificate from client for my team and neither him nor his teammates got anything.. After that his unnecessary taunts increased and I had no other option than to stop complete communication with him. I stopped even going for lunch with him.. Few days back, I thought to send a mail to him requesting him to have a face-to-face discussion and sort out all misunderstandings between us.. To that mail, he replied that he doesn't want to discuss anything.. Henceforth I am not going to have any interaction with him.. But, how should I forget him? I have to face him everyday.. I have to listen to his voice everyday.. And, I am feeling extremely lonely as he and his friend, was the only group I was comfortable with, as far as going for breakfast, lunch and tea is concerned.. Did I do anything wrong by loving him? And, how should I forget him now?... Please help..</p>
<h1>Viv- Eff him. He is just a jealous ass hoe. I had a guy like him in my hostel(he was just a friend). Totally filled with j-factor, arrogant, insulting to others, thought too much of himself and had negative views about everyone he knew, including his friends. We treated him like he deserved. Like dirt. So snap at him when you get the chance. Uske niche lag ke kabhi na rehna.. His views don't control you. You are not his puppet.</h1>
