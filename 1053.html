<p>Hey guys... I m little bit confused about a guy..., i got a frnd request on my real id.... I accepted that,, n he is a boy of 10 th standard... I was chating wid him normally as a younger bro... But he got attracted towards me on seeing my pics... N he wanna meet me but now he is showing his feelings... But i dint tell him that i m gay n knew his feeling from long...... I dnt hv such attraction towards him...plz suggest me what shud i do,.. Shud i reveal in front of him that i m also gay,,, or i shud behave as brother ......</p>
<h1>Viv- Listen, no one can force a relationship on you. If you get the feelings only then you proceed. Ask him face to face if he is gay. Let him speak his mind first. Its totally your decision if you want to be a lover or a brother. And its you who have to make him understand. He is too young for all of this.</h1>
