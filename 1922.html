<p>I want to confess..
Actually, i know i'm a gay and i like masturbating, i search all actors of all countries and whenever i masturbate, i think that i am having sex with those handsome actors. I watch gay porn also but after watching it for 2-3 mintutes, i lose intrest in it..but i generally feel uncomfortable whenever boys try to be friendly with me or when boys are around me, no one knows that i am gay and i just stay quiet , but i can't understand why i feel so much comfortable, i have only one friend but i never imagined myself having sex with him and he doesn't know who i am actually. Another problem is that i like isolation, more isolated i am, more i feel great, i am addicted to what my heart feels when i am alone and that's why i just stay alone evryday and i find irritating when my family talks with me, i threaten them to live me alone...many people criticise me that i stay in my own world but more time i spend in lonliness, i feel awesome...and ia don't befriend with someone, if someone tries to be friendly, i feel awkward and embarassing, so i ignore evryone, should i go to a psychologist?</p>
<h1>GCI- Your problem is that you have created a shell of protection around yourself and if anyone tries to enter it you feel awkward. This shell you have created so that know one should know about you and this behavior has made you unsociable. Your brain think that it will feel healthy if you are alone. The main reason can be your views about social stigma. You may feel that if anyone comes to know about you, you will go through the wrath of people. You may visit the psychologist but he will just delve further into you psychological system and make you understand about you. But you can yourself try to go out and make friends with good people who can take you out of your shell. You really can't stay alone all life, can you? Or else you will go into depression one day.</h1>
