<p>Title of Confession: "Can't I just get a friend?"</p>
<p>Warning:  IT WILL BE LONG .. it might be insulting to some people, but i am quite frank in saying what i feel, so sorry not sorry, It is not meant to hurt anyone tho, I respect you all .</p>
<p>Hey, Im a student from Amity, Noida and I am Pansexual
I recently thought to try the "Grindr App" in hopes to make a 'friend', and by friend I mean the definition given in the Oxford Dictionary.</p>
<p>a) As expected, Lot of spam accounts, most people are just confined to 'top' bottom' demarcations.</p>
<p>b) People addressing me as "dear" , are you sirious, Uncle ?</p>
<p>c) The chat starter question- "Where do you live" , I mean, The GPS shows us living in the same state, why the hell do you wanna narrow that down,I tell them "Delhi"  the dude will then ask, what part of delhi, i say "X" , he wants more details, even now, after that the bitch is somehow content, idk why . I know it is a hookup app, but not everyone is looking for sex, just so you know.
The point is - If we have to meet we can meet anyways, WE ARE IN THE SAME FUCKING STATE, and I have met 'friends' from another continent, just saying and i stay in touch with them perfectly too.</p>
<p>d) People still using the old ""English military"" way of asking someone's address - 
   "Where do you put up? ,.. bitch I put up in ur ass, happy now?
    PS. No one ever uses that anymore, so if you using it, dude. stop lol</p>
<p>e) Not one person I met there who is not desperate to meet, they just wanna meet, today, tomorrow, as soon as their dick gets up</p>
<p>f) and dick pics, omg , they scare me tbh </p>
<p>g) I still haven't found any cute guys, just hairy , weird looking dudes with profiles like "with place" "fun now" "i am hygenic .(lol) " and all other crap.</p>
<p>Ive lived in Holland for a few months, so i would tell you, the condition is almost similar there in grindr, same sex seeking assholes. and old men looking for twinks etc. but the biggest difference is that you will find a lot of young boys on there, some even 15,17 . and many of them look georgeous asf!
Which I never noticed here in India. What re gay teens here scared of ?? lol</p>
<p>Can't i just get a friend </p>
<h1>GCI- You can get a friend but you are condescending, impatient and demeaning as hell. Try leaving that attitude. Maybe the fault is with you.</h1>
