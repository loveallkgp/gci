<p>hey 25 ,doctor by profession, punjab
m 25 by age, bt in luks, i jst luk like a 20-21 yr, slim guy..even my patients confuse on first visit..(its not self-praise, m telling this becoz everything started frm here..he always wanted such type of guy as bf, though he was smart bt little bit chubby golu molu type. Was doing m tech. Age 25)
its almost 1.5 year ,when we broke up.
We met through fb in jan13. Came in relation after 1 month...i liked him becoz of his nature, sense of talking etc..was madly in lv with him nd he too.. Roj 2-2-3 hours fon pe baate krna, ,whats ap etc..mai uski choti choti baat ki care krta tha..like use cold vi hota to muze tension ho jati thi.....nd he too. Apni 1st date me e usne muze apni puri family se introduce krwa diya tha as frnd..ham uske ghar par e mile the 1st time. Usne ek family function pe invite kiya tha muze...everything was going well.. I never felt that he was time passing ..wo hamesha khta tha k mai india me nhi rhna chahta...
After 5 month, in MAY,i dont know what went wrong. He started ignoring me.. Mai use khta k weekend khi chalte hai.. He said abi papa ki shop pe muze baithna 1 week , papa busy hai.. Bt the very next day, i saw his fb update of on way to himachal with frnds...then after some days ek fb frnd ne btaya k we had a sex date yesterday..when i asked him, he accepted .nd said k mai sex k bina nhi rh sakta..i want sex only...so finaly we broke up in june... Strange is , he never asked me for sex..in our 6 mnth relation, we never had sex, jst kissing ..after break up ,vi hamari 2 3 var casual chat hui, nd he always asked koi new mila? after 5-6 mnth wo USA chala gya nd we never chatted after that..bt still we like each other's update on real fb id..
..dont know he was jst timepassing or realy lved me....
Feeling very lonely :(</p>
