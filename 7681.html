<p>Just recently I read a post by GCI  , talking bisexuality ....  I would like to share few things which everybody should know . Few reasons why gays lack respect and acceptance for bisexual men ..... Not all gays but few gays who lack respect &amp; acceptance  for bisexual ....  </p>
<p>1 ) Gays feel insecure , cheated and betrayed by bisexual men ... 
2 ) Bisexuals are those who are attracted to their own sex as well as their opposite sex . So u basically have no idea when bisexuals switch their orientation... </p>
<p>3) over emotional grounds it is impossible to trust bisexuals because they can very hardly stay loyal towards a single individual.  </p>
<p>4)  Bisexuals are desperate &amp; really not trust worthy . They have a habit of sleeping with women as well as men which gays or straights might dislike they don't stick up to a single person ..  </p>
<p>5 ) U feel disgusting to have a man who flirts with u , who go out on a date with u at the same time he goes out with someone of his opposite gender.  </p>
<p>6) A very simply question i have .....Why are all bisexuals in India so scared to let their wife or girlfriend know their sexual orientation?? Why ?? Because every bisexual man knows if they come out to their wife or girlfriend she would simply Kick his ass off even knowing that her boyfriend is hell loyal toward her ... and if u ask her why ?? Then her answer will obviously be that she would never like to have such a double standard man in her life ... </p>
<p>THIS  is why we gays dislike bisexual men . Because of their double standard behaviour .</p>
<h1>GCI- I will answer this in another post.</h1>
