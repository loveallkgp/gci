<h1>Viv- A reeeaaaaaaallllllyyyyyy long one but worth reading.</h1>
<p>Prashant (not his real name) was very good in
his studies. Throughout his academic career in
school and college, he always stood first in his
class and received one scholarship or the
other, at district level, state level and at
national level. After finishing his schooling, he
went to the most prestigious Engineering
College of the country, one of the IIT's, to
study Computer Science. At IIT also, he passed
with flying colours and then took admission in
IIM for a post graduate degree in management
and even before he could finish his degree, he
got a well-paid job in a multinational
company in a big city of India. Lucky chap,
wasn't he? Well, read on if you think so.
Apart from giving all the above virtues to him,
God had also chosen to make Prashant a
homosexual. While in first year in college, he
fell in love with one of his classmates. It all
started with a short kiss for which his
classmate had approached him. While
Prashant allowed his mate, who was a very
handsome boy, to have it, simultaneously he
also kindled a small fire of love for his friend
in his heart which became bigger and bigger
as their physical relations became more and
more intimate and within six months time
when their relations reached the ultimate, he
was already in deep love with his friend. What
about his friend? He had fallen in love with
Prashant, as he told Prashant later, the
moment he saw him. Unable to remain
separate even for a moment, they became two
bodies with one soul. Always ready to help
each other, they started living like husband
and wife. Requesting the warden, they
changed their rooms and became roommates.
If one of them fell sick, the other used to take
complete care of him which sometimes meant
keeping awake full night. Prashant being
better in studies than his friend, started
helping him so that his friend's score also
improved. Prashant's friend taught him
scooter driving. In short, they were all for
each other. Both of them were about 18 at
that time.
In teenage, many boys start developing
drinking habits. In their class also several
boys started drinking. When Prashant saw
these symptoms in his friend, he asked him
not to indulge in this dirty habit. His friend
promised him to stop this, but when Prashant
saw him drinking for the second time, he
warned his friend that he will sever all his
relations with him if he did not give up the
habit immediately and once for all. This
brought his friend to the right path and his
drinking habits were nipped in the bud. Same
thing happened with smoking and Prashant
refrained his friend from developing this habit
also. Those were the happiest days of
Prashant's life, or were the only days, as
Prashant now says, when he lived. Other times
of his life he has just spent or is spending
without any purpose or meaning.
The Engineering degree course was of five
years' duration. The last one year was very
traumatic for Prashant. He started thinking
what will happen after they pass out. Will he
have to separate from his friend? Even the
thought of it was terrifying. What can be done
about it? He started making several plans. Can
they take the job in the same city? It was not
impossible. Initially, one of them will have to
be content with a slightly inferior job. This
was not much of a problem. It could be
tolerated. However, his friend told him that it
was not going to work, as soon their parents
would start asking them for marriage and they
will not be able to live together in the same
house. Should they, then, run away from their
homes and start life in an unknown city? This
was also not acceptable to Prashant's friend,
as it would mean that they were dead for
their parents and other family members.
Prashant finally suggested that if they couldn't
live together, then they would remain
unmarried throughout their lives, be faithful
to each other and meet whenever possible.
After all, some normal husbands and their
wives also live in different cities due to
various reasons like job or business etc.
But this was also not acceptable to his friend
who said that it was not practical and the
family and society would not let them do this.
Nothing appeared to be working,
Time was fast running out. When it was only
six months for their final examinations,
Prashant started weeping bitterly sometimes in
private and sometimes before his friend. His
friend used to console him. He said that it
may not be possible for them to live together,
but they can remain in contact through
letters. Though away from one another, they
can still live like good friends and help each
other in life. And whenever possible, they
could meet also. However, it was no
consolation for Prashant. This was not
acceptable to him at all. He thought, after his
friend marries, a girl would be his wife and
what would he be? His keep? Impossible! If
his urge becomes that great, he would pay to
any beggar on the street and have it with him
rather than giving himself the status of a
keep. If he took his friend's suggestion then
simultaneously he would also have to take a
pledge that he would never never meet his
partner again in his life, because if he met,
his urge would not let him away from his
friend. And if this happens, if his friend even
touches his nail, at the very moment Prashant
would fall in his own eyes. His body would
become dirty and unholy. What was the use
of having such a relation in which he had to
take such a pledge?
When it was only one month left for their
separation, Prashant started preparing himself
for the inevitable. He made his heart hard like
a stone, stopped crying, kept himself busy in
his studies, and talked very little to his friend.
His bodily relations with his friend almost
stopped.
When the time for separation finally came,
Prashant's friend took him in his arms for the
last time and kissed him softly. The five year
old relations which started with a kiss were
ending with another. Tears wanted to roll out
of Prashant's eye balls but he forcibly
controlled himself. He just gave a blank look
to his friend and separated from him.
When Prashant reached his home, he was not
in his senses. He did not know what he was
doing, what he was saying, where he was
going. It was as if an unseen force was driving
him. As if he was mesmerized. At his home, it
was an atmosphere of joy and happiness every
where. Prashant had become an Engineer. His
parents, brothers and sisters, friends and
neighbours, everybody was so happy. Every
body wanted to celebrate. In their celebration
nobody looked at Prashant or could see what
was going on inside him. As Prashant's
condition stabilized a little, he tried to look
normal as far as possible. When anybody
offered a pleasantry he returned a smile.
When somebody cut a joke he laughed. But
nobody could feel that Prashant's smiles were
empty and his laughs were hollow.
For Prashant life had been a bed of roses so
far but now a hard and rough surface was
under his feet. Prashant was hardly 23 and
the life had already finished for him. While at
college, he was not able to remain separate
from his friend even for a moment. He used
to come home only in semester breaks when
the holidays were for fifteen days or more. In
shorter holidays he preferred to remain at
hostel with his friend. Prashant started
thinking what would be his life without his
friend. How was he going to spend all his life
without him now? He felt suffocated. He was
undergoing acute pain. His condition was that
of an out-of-water fish. During the last one
year at college, Prashant used to forget his
problems only when he was busy in his
studies. But now there was nothing to study.
His friend's face always remained before his
eyes. He was unable to forget him even for a
moment.
Near the outskirts of Prashant's town used to
flow a small stream. Prashant would go there
in the evening and sit near its bank. He used
to think about the times he spent with his
friend and also about what was in store for
him. Tears would invariably come out of his
eyes. Since there used to be nobody around at
that time he made no efforts to stop them.
Warm water of Prashant's eyes and cold water
of the stream used to flow together. When it
became too dark, he would return. Sometimes
he would think what if he jumped into the
stream! Within a second, there would be an
end to his tale of woes.
But what would happen to his parents, who
were so proud of him? What he was
undergoing now will have to be borne by his
parents. How would they be able to bear his
loss, a loss of their 23 year old son when he
was not able to bear the separation from his
friend with whom he spent only about five
years.
Prashant spent next three months with great
difficulty and in acute pain. He used to get
some relief only when he received a letter
from his friend or when he was writing one to
him. They used to write once in fifteen days.
Mostly they wrote about the jobs appearing in
newspaper, how to get application forms,
where to apply and so on.
And then Prashant got admission in IIM. It
was a great relief for him. At IIM he would be
able to keep himself busy, he thought. He
would also be able to meet his friend
occasionally because he would get single room
there. After joining IIM and settling there, the
first thing which Prashant did was to invite his
friend. When his friend came and took him in
his arms, both of them started crying. Both
were trying to persuade each other not to cry
but both were crying themselves. Soon they
realized that it was not possible for any of
them to control his tears and so they let them
flow freely. It was after more than three
months that they were seeing each other.
They were never away for such a long time
before. There was so much to talk, so much to
tell, so much to listen. Mostly they wanted to
tell each other how difficult it was for them
to remain separated. Prashant's friend stayed
with him for three days and then he left. After
this Prashant started calling his friend every
three to four months for two-three days.
Once Prashant received a letter from his
friend in which he had written that his parents
hoped that immediately after passing out he
would get a good job. However, it had not
happened so even after six months and
therefore the behaviour of his parents had
become rude towards him. In a very
sentimental letter his friend wrote that
nobody except Prashant loved him in this
world and therefore either he should call him
to his hostel or he should come to his home.
Prashant was very sad to read this. He knew
that while he himself was very emotional, his
friend was not so. Still he had written such a
letter. It sure meant that he was having really
tough time. His friend whom he loved more
than his life was in trouble. What he could do
to help him? Neither his friend could live
indefinitely at IIM hostel nor was it possible
for Prashant to live at his friend's home.
Prashant only wrote to his friend that he
should not lose heart and have courage. He
also wrote that it was not possible for an
engineer to remain unemployed for long.
Soon he would get a good job and then
everything will be alright.
Next time when Prashant's friend visited him,
Prashant noticed that his friend had only one
pair of good clothes. The same evening he
bought two pairs of best clothes and
presented them to his friend. His friend was
surprised and asked why he was doing this
since they had never gifted anything to each
other before, not even when they were
together at college. Prashant replied that since
they were unable to live together, it was
possible for his friend to forget him. He
added that whenever he would put on those
clothes he would remember him. Though
Prashant was managing only on scholarship
and was not taking any money from home, he
was very happy to offer the present to his
friend.
After some time Prashant received a letter
from his friend that he had got a job and the
behaviour of his parents was also good now.
After completing his MBA Prashant also got a
job. Now Prashant also started visiting his
friend. They used to visit each other every
five-six months for two to three days.
Thus they remained in touch for six more
years after leaving the college. The next turn
in Prashant's life came when he received a
letter from his friend in which he informed
that his marriage had been fixed and he would
be getting married on a particular date. For
last seven to eight years of Prashant's eleven
years association with his friend, he had
always been telling Prashant that a day would
definitely come when he would have to marry.
On the other hand Prashant could never
accept the reality and always persuaded his
friend to remain unmarried all his life. Now
the time had come for Prashant to accept the
reality. But Prashant was still not prepared for
this. Prashant could simply not imagine his
friend to be in somebody else's arms. The
thought was acutely painful to him. Not
knowing what to do, he did not reply to his
friend's letter. After a few days he received
another letter from his friend in which he had
apologized to Prashant and wrote that he was
helpless. Prashant still did not reply. Third
letter came from his friend in which he had
again asked Prashant to forgive him adding
that the things were beyond his control.
Prashant did not reply to this letter either.
Then the letters form his friend stopped.
About fifteen days passed. Prashant was
restless. He wrote to his friend to visit him.
His friend came and stayed for about a week
with him. Prashant asked him to cancel the
marriage. His friend was not to agree at all.
Prashant then threatened to commit suicide
and said that on his dead body only he would
be able to marry. Ultimately his friend agreed
and then only Prashant allowed him to leave.
It was decided that immediately after reaching
his place, Prashant's friend would send an
anonymous letter to the girl's side telling
them that the boy was of a lower caste than
they had disclosed.
As per the agreement, Prashant's friend was
supposed to keep him informed of the
developments. However, Prashant did not
listen anything from his friend for about
fifteen days. The day of his friend's marriage
also passed. Still he had no information.
Prashant then decided to visit his friend's
native place and after performing overnight
train journey he reached there. He found that
his friend's marriage had already taken place.
His friend did not talk to him much. He only
said that since everything was at the final
stage, he did not think it proper to do
anything for cancellation of the marriage.
Completely shattered and broken, Prashant
returned.
Sun was still shining, rivers were still flowing,
flowers yet blossomed and the birds still
chirped but the world had changed for
Prashant. Everything had finished for him.
Now Prashant was all alone in this world. His
friend had left him forever to wander in this
vast world. Prashant locked himself in his
room and started drinking. He was the same
Prashant who had one day refrained his friend
from drinking. Today he was drinking himself.
He stopped going to his work and drank
continuously. But wine was not helping him at
all. Not even for a single moment Prashant
could forget his friend. The charming face of
his friend always remained before his eyes.
Prashant's only companion of those days was
an old servant who used to cook for him and
did other household chores. When Prashant
did not attend his work for about two months
he lost his multinational job.
Prashant spent about six months in this
shattered state of mind. He was away from
his home-town in a distant state. He did not
write anything to his parents because there
was no hope of getting any help. On the
contrary, his problems would have increased.
He would have faced an volley of questions,
how it happened, what are you doing now,
you come here, try for another job and so on.
After six months his pain started reducing a
little. Now he started looking towards other
things. The first major responsibility was to
look for another job. His accumulated savings
of last four years had almost been fully spent
on wine and other requirements. He started
applying for jobs and after about two months
he got a job in a Govt. company. This job was
much inferior to his multinational job. But
Prashant had no other alternative than to
accept it.
This job was in a city which was closer to his
home-town. After he got settled in his new
job and city, his parents started visiting him
and started pressurizing him for marriage.
Prashant simply refused. He said that he did
not even want to talk about it. However, he
found that gradually not only his parents, but
his relatives, friends, colleagues, neighbours
and everybody in the world whom he knew
started pressurizing him for it. Whenever
anybody came to meet him, he only talked
about his marriage and nothing else. It
appeared to him that there was no other topic
in this world for the people to talk about
other than his marriage. The people simply
did not give up. He talked to them rudely,
almost insulted them, even told them to leave
his place, but with no result. The people
appeared to have infinite patience. Whosoever
had a girl of marriageable age in this world,
started visiting Prashant in his house and
office. God alone knew from where did they
all get his home and office addresses.
Prashant got tired of saying no to them.
Prashant's health had been severely affected
during last eight months due to his sorry state
of mind and taking excessive wine. Moreover
in this new place he used to eat outside since
he did not know cooking. Many times he felt
lazy to go to a hotel and slept hungry. This
also affected his health badly. He started
falling sick very often and had continuous
fever. Sometimes he would start shivering in
office and his colleagues would point it out to
him. When Prashant visited the doctors, they
gave him medicines but advised not to take
them on empty stomach. Many times Prashant
could not take the medicines since he neither
wanted to cook nor wanted to go out to eat at
the restaurant.
Prashant had an elder sister who was not
having good relations with her husband and
her in-laws. She had hired a house for her
and was living separately along with her
children. This was continuing for several years
and there appeared no possibility for
rapprochement. Her husband was not giving
her any financial support and she managed on
her own with difficulty. Prashant thought, if
she can live separately in the same town, then
she can live with him also in his city. This way
Prashant will have someone to look after him
and her sister's financial problems will also be
solved. He, therefore, after some persuasion,
brought his sister and her children to live
with him. However, all their relatives, friends,
and neighbours etc. started asking why she
was living with Prashant. Such questions were
being put to both Prashant and his sister.
Prashant boldly told that his sister's in-laws
were not treating her well and therefore she
would now live with him. But this was no
satisfactory answer for the people. Everybody
had a daughter, either his own, or his
relative's, or his friend's or somebody else's
whom he wanted to marry with Prashant.
Therefore the solution which Prashant and his
sister had found to help each other was not
acceptable to them at all. It was almost a
crime for them.
People started telling his sister that she
purposely wanted that Prashant does not
marry so that she keeps getting financial help
from him. They started so much interference
in Prashant's house that his sister became
mentally imbalanced and started quarelling
with Prashant and in less than six months she
had to return.
And this was the time when Prashant started
thinking about his marriage. Somebody was
required to take care of him. It was four years
since his friend got married. He had no news
about him since then. Neither would he ever
like to get any throughout his life. Prashant
also knew that he would not get any other
partner. After all, homosexuals are not
available on demand. Especially one who may
live with him for his life. Every day thousands
of matrimonials are published in newspapers
but not even a single one is for him. He had
already accepted the reality that he would
have to live without sex for his remaining life.
With nobody to give courage to him, with no
possibility of getting any help from any
where, with nobody to show him the right
path, he decided that the next time if any
proposal came he would not say no. He had
been resisting it for about ten years, but now
he would surrender before the family and
society pressure and his circumstances. What
about sex with his wife? Prashant planned that
he would do acting in bed to please her.
And sooner than he thought, it happened.
Relations in our country for the boys of
marriageable age are available in such a great
number that even before your asking for one,
hundreds will be ready. His parents brought a
relation and in a week moment, by a nod of
his head he accepted it and Prashant's
'marriage' was performed. Thus was
committed by Prashant the biggest mistake of
his life. And another tale of Prashant's woes
started. Prashant could not give shape to his
plan of acting in bed. He could not perform at
all. He did not have any taste for his wife's
body though she was very beautiful. He did
not like a woman's touch.
He hated it. It used to be over before he
started. In less than five minutes everything
used to get finished. It was a burden on him.
He was scared of the nights. Come evening
and he wished that he could run away
somewhere. He felt like getting raped every
time he did it. And his frequency became
lower and lower. Initially it was once a week,
then it reduced to once a month and finally
once in several months. However, Prashant
got two children with his relations from his
wife within five years, first a daughter and
then a son.
It is evening. Prashant has returned from
office. His wife has had a hair-cut and has
put on a new sari. She expects Prashant to tell
whether the beautician has done a good job.
She also wants to know how the sari looks on
her. However, Prashant does not say anything
as he has not noticed anything. All day his
wife has been alone waiting for him. Now she
wants to talk to him. She prepares tea for him
and herself and sits near him, her body
touching Prashant's. Her touch is
uncomfortable for Prashant. However, he
tolerates. His wife starts talking. Within a few
minutes her touch becomes very
uncomfortable for Prashant and he shifts a
little to avoid her touch. His wife notices it.
She is hurt. She stops talking and looks at
Prashant. Prashant is avoiding her looks and
seeing somewhere else. She controls her
feelings and again starts talking. Several things
have happened in the day. She wants to tell
everything to Prashant. One of her friends has
bought a new type of dress. She also wants to
buy a similar one. She knows that if she asks
for money, Prashant would give it to her, but
she wants Prashant to accompany her to the
market and help her in selecting a good one.
Summer vacations are approaching. The
neighbours are going on an excursion trip to a
hill station. She also wants to go for a trip
with Prashant, not necessarily to a hill
station, just to some near- by place. The
maidservant is asking for more money. She
wants an advice from Prashant.
She keeps on asking questions but Prashant
doesn't reply to any. She repeats her
questions but still no response comes from
Prashant. She realizes that whatever she has
been talking for last ten minutes, Prashant
has not heard anything. She is deeply hurt.
She gives an ugly look to Prashant, gets up,
goes to the bedroom, and lies down. Within a
few minutes, Prashant listens the sounds of
her sobbing. He is dumbstruck. He knows that
he must go to the bedroom, take her in his
arms, console her, and assure her that he
loves her. But he has only his sympathies for
her and no love. He will have to do acting. All
his life he has been doing acting. He is tired
of acting. No more acting now. He keeps
sitting, glued to his place, listening to her
sobbing, his head bowed down in shame.
Prashant prefers to sit alone and remain lost
in his memories. He has lived a long life. He
has a wealth of memories, the painful
moments which he has lived. He keeps
thinking about them. And when the tears roll
out of his eyes, he gets relief. This is the only
pleasure, he can hope for. This is the only
happiness he will ever get in his life.
Lost in his memories, Prashant is thinking -
He had come to his home in semester break.
There he had fallen sick. He had very high
fever in the night and was lying in bed in
almost semi-conscious state. In the morning
when he woke up, his elder sister, who had
been nursing him, had asked - Prashant, who
is R.....? Prashant was stunned. He has not
told anybody in this world about his friend.
How, then, does she know his name? He
started stammering -
N...N...No...No...Nobody! Nobody? - His
sister was surprised - But you were taking his
name in your sleep. You were calling him.
Several feelings developed in Prashant's heart.
Anxiety, happiness, worry, satisfaction,
shyness. However, hiding all his feelings,
Prashant maintained - I do not know anything.
I might be dreaming something. His sister had
not argued much with him and the matter was
forgotten.
After returning to the hostel, Prashant had
told his friend about it. As he was narrating
the incidence, his friend kept staring at him in
disbelief. Then suddenly he pulled Prashant
towards himself and holding him tightly in his
arms, started kissing him like a mad. Prashant
tried to say - What happened...O dear...why?
However, his friend had not allowed him to
say anything. He had sealed Prashant's lips
with his own. After his passion subsided, he
lifted Prashant's chin and looked straight into
his eyes. Prashant could clearly see - His
friend's eyes were moist and he was asking -
Prashant, you love me so much? Why you love
me so much Prashant? What have I given you?
Prashant wanted to say several things. He
wanted to say - You have given me the
purpose of life. You have given me the
meaning of living. I am nothing without you.
You are like Sun and I am like earth. I keep
revolving around you. You are like God and I
am a soul. I want to get assimilated in you. I
want to lose my identity into yours. You are a
big and strong shady tree and I am a thin and
weak creeper. I cannot grow without your
support. However, Prashant could not say
anything. He simply hid his face in his
friend's wide chest. Yet his beating heart said
everything and through the soft warmth of his
body his friend listened everything. He kept
Prashant in his arms for a long time
affectionately combing his hair by his fingers
as if Prashant was a small child. Where is his
shady tree today? Why he has been snatched
away from his arms? The thin and weak
creeper has fallen on the ground. It will never
grow now. It is lying there unattended,
uncared-for, waiting for its long, slow and
painful death.
Prashant's wife was a postgraduate in science.
She was a sweet natured girl. But now, her
behaviour has become very bad. She has
become abnormal as she did not get any love
or proper sex from Prashant.
She has started quarreling with Prashant on
all small and big issues, keeps shouting on
him, abuses him and his family members,
curses her own parents that they married her
to Prashant and so on. She also many times
hits Prashant and sometimes even slaps him.
She speaks in such an abusive and vulgar
language which even the prostitutes at a
brothel would be ashamed to listen. Prashant
tolerates all this because he knows that he is
at fault, because he had no right to marry
her, because he has spoiled her life. He must
tolerate it because he is a sinner, because his
habits are dirty, because the society hates
him, because the God's curse has fallen on
him, because he is a homosexual. But
sometimes, he loses his patience and he also
starts shouting in equally abusive language
and hits his wife. They start physically fighting
like a dog and a cat. Even a lowest class
labourer or sweeper will be shocked to see
them fighting like this. All this they do right in
front of their children and when their
neighbours are listening. Nobody can imagine
that both of them are highly qualified. The
matter ends after Prashant has badly hit his
wife using not only his hands but also legs
and after she starts crying and locks herself in
the bedroom. The children remain frightened.
For two to three days no food is cooked at
home, and both Prashant and his wife remain
hungry. For the children, Prashant gets
something from a nearby restaurant.
While Prashant has no affection for his wife,
he loves his children very much. He explains
it like this - a normal man equally divides his
love between his wife and children, but in my
case it is all concentrated on my children
only. However, it has made an adverse affect
on his wife. She has became jealous of her
own children because they get so much love
from Prashant and she doesn't get any, and
she frequently beats and abuses them without
any reason, she does not give them food,
does not care about their studies.
She says when nobody cares about her, why
should she take care of anybody. Many times
when Prashant returns from office, he finds
his children in tears telling him that their
mother has hit them badly and has not given
them anything for lunch. And she would not
cook dinner either as she has closed herself
in her room. Then Prashant cooks for his
children. He does not know much cooking,
only a few simple things he can prepare.
Sometimes Prashant also becomes arrogant.
He has returned hungry and tired from his
office. There are problems in office also which
he has to attend and solve. Then there are so
many problems at home. He cannot do
anything for these children. Who asked them
to take birth in his home? If this is their fate
then he cannot help. And he also does not
cook for them. That day his children sleep
hungry.
Late in the night when Prashant's anger
subsides, he gets up and goes to the
children's room. He wants to give some food
to them, or perhaps he can warm up milk for
them. But the children are fast asleep. It is
not proper to wake them up at this hour.
Prashant's heart goes out to his children.
What is their fault? Why they have to suffer
so much? He sits near them on their bed and
passes his fingers in their hair and kisses
them. Then he consoles himself that in the
morning he would get up very early and
prepare something for them and will keep it
ready before the children get up.
Why is Prashant's wife so cruel towards her
own children? It is because Prashant loves
them. They are the only thing which Prashant
has got from his life. They are an asset to
him. He forgets his miseries when he sees
their face. He feels happy when he takes them
in his arms. Prashant's wife knows it very
well. Prashant is her enemy. Where should
one attack one's enemy? Definitely where one
is weakest. Prashant's children are his
weakness. Therefore being cruel to the
children will hurt Prashant to the maximum.
She has long back forgotten that they are the
same children whom she protected in her
belly for nine months.
Prashant's children, who are not getting any
love from their mother, are growing
abnormal. Their growth is retarded and they
are poor in their studies. Yes, the children of
such an eminent father are poor in studies.
They love their papa very much from whom
they get the love of father as well as mother.
But Prashant cannot live with them
throughout the day. He has to attend office.
They have to live with their mother whom
they are very much afraid of. Prashant's
children will grow up eccentric and abnormal.
They will marry and give rise to unhappy and
abnormal families. And the chain will
continue.
Who is at fault? Prashant, who had no desire
for a woman's body, whom the society
forcibly married to a woman and who could
not act in bed? His wife, who never got any
thing from her husband which was her right
and who became a half lunatic? Their
children, who never got any love from their
mother and who are constantly living in fear?
Who will answer this question?
Shouldn't Prashant be content with what he
has got? Shouldn't he understand that he
would not get any man for love? He has only
his wife. Why doesn't he try to love her? He is
highly educated. He should try to avoid
disintegration of the family. Prashant says -
Life is the name of mutual caring and sharing
of your partner's small pleasures and sorrows,
of feeling happy in sacrificing your own minor
requirements and needs for your partner's.
Such feelings are completely missing in me
for my wife. I simply don't feel happy in my
wife's day-to-day minor pleasures, I simply
don't feel sorry in her problems. I remain
neutral unless she is facing some big trouble.
Contrast this with my feelings for my friend.
If even a pin hurt him, I was deeply pained.
Probably sexual feelings are necessary for
loving your partner. I am concerned about my
wife but I do not feel any affection for her.
If Prashant cannot love his wife, why can't he
treat her as his friend? Friendship has been
given a higher place than even love among
good virtues of life. People have been found
to give their life for friendship. Prashant
answers it like this - A friend is one from
whom we do not hide anything, one who
knows everything about ourselves. But in my
case, each and every aspect of my personality,
my reality, my needs, my desires, my
requirements, everything is hidden from my
wife. How can she be my friend?
Of late Prashant's life has taken an ugly turn.
But before we tell it to you, it is necessary to
describe an event which happened with him
while he was studying in Engineering. Then
Prashant was in his teenage and looked cute.
Out of about 50 boys of his class, more than
half were after him. However, Prashant had
already got his friend whom he considered as
his husband. Therefore whenever any other
boy approached him for sex, he used to scold
him badly. Due to this or otherwise two boys
of his class one day tried to rape him. It was
a summer evening and almost all the boys of
the hostel were out to playgrounds. Prashant
had no interest in games. He was taking bath
in the bathroom under the shower. The walls
of the bathroom were only about 7 feet tall
and were not touching the ceiling. There were
no clothes on Prashant's body. Suddenly a boy
of Prashant's class scaled the walls of the
bathroom and jumped inside. He was in
complete nude. He asked Prashant to allow
him to have sex with him or he would do it
forcibly. The boy was very tall, hefty and
robust. With a short height and small body,
Prashant was no match for him. There was no
use shouting since the bathrooms had been
constructed at the end of a wing containing
fifteen rooms in a line and were far away
from the central portion of the hostel where
somebody might be present. Moreover, the
main door of the room containing bathrooms
and toilets etc. had already been closed by
the boy as he told Prashant. He had switched
off the lights also.
What was Prashant to do? How was he to save
himself? The boy would not listen to any of
his requests to spare him. Prashant's mind
worked fast. And he thought of a trick.
Though he was tense, he made his face very
soft and his voice as sweet as possible and
told the boy that he was himself very much
interested in having sex with him, but what
was the fun doing it in a small one metre by
two metre bathroom on a hard and wet floor.
Prashant told the boy that after taking bath he
would himself come to his room where they
could enjoy comfortably. And his trick
worked. The boy got convinced and he left the
bathroom again scaling the walls.
However, as soon as he left, another boy, who
was also Prashant's class mate and equally
hefty and tall, came in scaling the walls. He
was also totally naked. He did not even have
patience to talk to the earlier boy and ask him
what had happened. Prashant, therefore,
repeated his trick and was again successful.
While the boy was leaving, Prashant, who was
very much afraid, asked him whether anybody
else was also waiting to take his turn, to which
the boy replied that there was nobody and
therefore Prashant need not worry. Prashant,
in that tough moment also smiled thinking
that the rascal came to rape him and now he
was trying to be affectionate.
After Prashant returned to his room and
bolted the door from inside, he found the
boys knocking his door continuously for
about two hours before they gave up. When
Prashant narrated the incidence to his friend,
he advised him to take evening bath a little
late when all the boys have returned from the
playgrounds. He also advised Prashant to
carry a sewing needle with him to the
bathroom to protect himself. However,
Prashant decided not to report the incidence
to the authorities since it would have earned
a bad name for Prashant also.
Now about the turn in Prashant's life about
which we were talking. One day he read in a
magazine that there are certain parks in the
city, where homosexual men meet and find
their partner. He thought of visiting these
parks and started waiting for the opportunity.
And soon he got it. His wife left for her
parental house along with the children and he
was left alone in the house for ten days. Then
he started visiting those parks. On the first
day he found a 20 year old boy sitting alone
reading, or pretending to read, a newspaper.
He continued looking at him for a long time,
but being totally inexperienced, he did not go
very near to him and the boy also did not
notice Prashant. After a long time a man
came. He sat near the boy. Then he borrowed
the newspaper from the boy and started
reading it. After this he started talking to the
boy. Finally both of them got up and started
moving outside the park. The man placed his
arm on the back of the boy. They continued
moving here and there for some time.
Prashant was following them. Finally they
came to the parking. The boy had a motor-
bike. They climbed the motor-bike and left
the place.
For next four days Prashant kept on visiting
the parks and he saw similar things but he
could not get any partner for himself. On the
sixth day, he found a 25 year old boy sitting
alone at a lonely spot in the park. The boy
appeared to be belonging to a low class and
was not suitable for Prashant. However,
Prashant's urge was high. He had not touched
any man for about twelve years. Therefore
Prashant was not ready to miss the chance.
He kept looking at the boy from a distance.
When nobody came near the boy for a long
time, Prashant went nearer to him and started
wandering about him. He then noticed
Prashant, called him and asked him to sit near
him. Prashant obeyed. Then he started talking
to Prashant. Such a long time had passed for
Prashant being away from his earlier partner
that it was almost like a new experience to
him. His whole body was shivering with
sensation.
He was unable to reply to him. His condition
was exactly the same as that of a bride on the
first night, first moments. When the boy
found that Prashant was not answering to any
of his questions, he said - "Arre! Bolte
nahin!" (Why don't you talk!). Slowly Prashant
started answering to him by the movements of
his head and finally he also started talking.
The boy told Prashant that he lives alone in
his house and if he wanted they could enjoy.
The boy was a motor mechanic. The place
where he lived was a colony where low class
people live. Prashant started thinking should
he go with him. Was he to have it with such
people? He was undecided. He finally told the
boy that he had some work at that time and
would not be able to come with him at that
moment but asked the boy his name and the
telephone number of the garage where he
worked.
Next two days there was a continuous
argument between Prashant's heart and mind.
His mind said how could Prashant even think
of going with such a low class man which in
no way can be a match for him. However his
heart replied that who could remain away
from sex for such a long time. This boy also
he got after hunting for six days. Moreover
within a day or two his wife would be arriving
and he would never get the chance again.
Finally Prashant's heart won the battle. He
telephoned the boy and asked him to come to
his house.
What Prashant is up to? What is he going to
do? Great heavens, why don't you fall? Mother
earth, why don't you split? Isn't there
anybody who can stop Prashant? O Prashant,
you are the same person who one day so
tactfully and proudly saved his body from two
of his classmates under very adverse
conditions. They belonged to good families.
They were Engineers. Still you did not prefer
it with them. What has happened to you now?
O God, do something to save Prashant.
But nothing happened. God did not help
Prashant. Skies didn't fall. Earth didn't split.
And Prashant spoiled his body. At the age of
about 41, he lost his chastity to a person who
was at best suited to be his servant. He did
not care for his social status. He did not
worry about his education. How many Indians
can hope to get the education which Prashant
received? People covet it. It is a feat for
them. Who could have imagined that Prashant
would have such a downfall?
And once spoiled, Prashant could never
recover. He did it daily for next few days with
that boy till his wife returned. Prashant did
not stop even after this. He started going to
the motor mechanic's dirty house in his dingy
colony. And through him he obtained some
other contacts also. Prashant started doing it
regularly. Whenever he gets time, he visits
those parks and hunts for people.
Sometime ago, Prashant also started hunting
for people on Internet. Here the people are
good. They are educated and belong to good
families. However, on the Internet there is a
danger. He has to send several e-mails to a
friend before they decide to meet. These e-
mails gradually start becoming emotional and
Prashant tends to fall in love with his e-
friends. He almost started loving several of his
such friends even before seeing them. Then
he started having acute pain. His old wounds
which his friend had given him one day almost
got renewed. Therefore Prashant does not
prefer Internet. He has now closed his affairs
on it. He has understood that he has only
right to have crude sex. He does not have
right to love anybody. Therefore it is better to
go with dirty people with whom he cannot fall
in love.
Prashant knows what he is doing is wrong. A
continuous fight goes on inside him between
his urge and the consciousness of his guilt.
Sometimes his consciousness wins. And then
Prashant stops wandering here and there. But
within six months his urge becomes too great
and he again starts. He has two personalities,
which keep on fighting with each other.
He is torn in two pieces.
Prashant wants to die. But he cannot commit
suicide. What will happen to his children?
What will happen to the lady who lives with
him and whom the people call his wife? At
least he is giving economic support to her. At
least he is giving her social security. At least
he is giving her a roof to live under.
Why is Prashant so unhappy with life? Why
can't he consider himself to be a widow? After
all a window also does not get any love or sex
for life. Prashant says - a widow does not
have anything to hide. People are aware of
her problems and are sympathetic to her. Can
I tell anybody what are my problems? Can I
disclose to my friends or relatives what is the
cause of my difficulties? The pain of
concealing one's identity even from one's
nearest and dearest ones throughout life is so
great that the analogy does not go very far.
Today Prashant has become about fifty years
old. He looks like a man but he is just a
corpse which can walk. He is slowly burning
and melting like a candle. But his end is still
nowhere in sight. homosexuality is his only
dirty habit. He has never developed any other
bad habit in his life. His tastes are good. He
enjoys only very high quality literature. He is
pained at the increasing vulgarity in electronic
and print media. He does not watch Indian TV
and cinema as they are highly sub-standard.
He has been a strict vegetarian and a
complete teetotaler throughout his life except
for his setback period when he started taking
wine. He prefers homemade food. His health
is good. Therefore he would need at least 25
more years to die if not more. As he is
growing older, his urge for getting love is
increasing rather than reducing. He wants to
live with one man. He does not want multiple
sex. He is not satisfied with crude sex.
He wants to have it with someone whom he
loves, someone who loves him, someone who
lives with him in his house, who eats with
him, who sleeps near him on the same bed, in
who's arms he feels as safe and secure as a
child in his mother's arms and who will never
leave him alone. But it cannot happen. The
society will never tolerate it. It has got its
own ways. Prashant is nobody to choose his
own life style. Even if it does not hurt
anybody. The society can allow thousands of
open ads published daily in all newspapers in
which heterosexuals seek BM girls and ladies
for sex in the name of penfriends! The society
can also allow unambiguous ads of health
clubs/physical fitness centres supplying boys
to homosexuals in hotels in the name of
messieurs! What a great definition of
BM'ness! What a beautiful way of keeping
oneself fit! Will the same society allow
Prashant to issue an ad seeking his life
partner? Never! It is wrong! It is unethical! It
is against nature!
It was Prashant's birthright to have a life-
partner. It was his basic human right to get
married to a person of his choice. His human
right has been violated. Where does he go?
Whom should he complain? Who would do
justice with him? This society owes an answer
to him. But it will not give him that answer.
Because it is adamant. Because it is
thoughtless. And because Prashant is in
minority and he cannot come out in the open
shouting for his rights.
Weeping uncontrollably in a counselling
centre, Prashant says - How high I felt when I
scolded boys other than my partner
approaching me for sex. I wanted to be a Sita
but I ended up being worse than a prostitute.
A prostitute sells her body for her survival.
She has no other alternative. But I do it for
satisfying my bodily lust. Moreover, the way I
am going with people, any day I will catch
AIDS. And through me my wife will also catch
it. If both of us die, what will happen to my
children?
Prashant adds - Today I have to contend with
this small job which gives me just enough to
feed my family of four. I have lost the
inclination, desire, courage or ambition for
more. Had I been allowed to marry my friend,
we together could have established a big
company or started an industry. We would
have progressed much and would also have
helped in the progress of our nation. But it
was not acceptable to the society. It was more
interested in suppressing my needs, crushing
my desires, and ruining my life. And along
with mine several others. What could have
gone wrong had I been permitted to live with
my friend? We would not have done any
crime, we would not have raped women, we
would not even have increased the population
of this country. We could have adopted
destitute children and given home to them.
Unnecessarily I increased the population of
this earth by two.
He suggests to the parents of young boys - if
your son continuously refuses to marry
without any apparent reason, explore this
possibility by asking him and if you find that
it is true then this is the time for you to give
him maximum love and care, more than what
you gave him when he was a baby. Never
scold him, never hate him. He is not a dirty
person. He is a good boy. Only he is
different. Tell him that you understand. Tell
him that he should not get disheartened. Tell
him that you are there to look after his needs.
Ask him who is his best friend. Ask him with
whom he would like to spend his life. And
once he tells you, talk to the parents of the
other boy and arrange a separate house for
them to live in, if possible in a different city.
And never forget to bless the boys as you
would bless your son and daughter-in-law.
Don't ever think that they would be doing
dirty things behind the door. Because you son
and daughter-in-law would also do the same
thing. There is no difference. Just there is no
difference.
If you failed in your duties, your son, the
apple of your eyes will burn in a slow fire
throughout his life and the process will end
only with his death which will be very far,
very very far.
Prashant says - I got married because I did
not have any friend and there was no hope
also to get one. Had my friend not left me
alone in this world, I would have never
married whether I was allowed to live with
him or not. When I agreed for marriage I had
mixed feelings. My parents and others were
irritating me for years and my heart revolted.
It cried - bloody fools, why can't you
understand that there must be some problem
if I am constantly refusing it? O. K. if you
want this, then let it happen. If you want me
to spoil the life of a girl, then let it be so. I
forgot that I was only harming myself, the girl
whom I was to marry and my future children.
Nobody else was to lose anything. My parents
happily died and the self-proclaimed well
wishers never turned back to see what way we
were spending our life. Now I sincerely feel
that instead of revolting and taking the wrong
step I should have disclosed my reality to my
parents. I should have gathered a little
courage and probably written a letter to my
father if face to face talk was not possible.
While it cannot be disclosed to the society, I
could have disclosed it within the family. It
would have solved many problems.
To the young boys, Prashant suggests - Never
bow down to the pressure of the society and
get married. It is your life and only you will
decide how you want to live it. Nobody else
has any control over it. Not even your
parents. Society will butcher you if you don't
resist. Take lesson from my example and my
ruined life. It is very easy these days to get a
good partner with the help of the Internet.
Make one partner and live with him
throughout your life. Hire or buy a separate
house for yourself.
Don't live with your parents. And be careful.
Since there won't be any social binding on you
and your friend, it will be very easy for you to
get separated from him in case of slight
misunderstanding or quarrel. Avoid it with all
your might. Bind yourself with your friend in
other ways. Bind yourself economically. Make
huge purchases like a house, car etc. in joint
names with shared money. Make big
investments in joint names. Do everything
jointly. Give everything you have to your
friend. And never never be unfaithful to him.
Do not run after multiple sex. The feeling of
loving and getting loved by somebody is much
more enjoyable than having sex with many
people.
Prashant says - Homosexual is the dirtiest
word in our society. He is considered dirtier
than a crawling insect of a gutter. People
laugh at him, ridicule him, hate him, and hurl
abuses at him. He is untouchable. Why?
Simply because he is different than others?
Because he is in minority? Because he goes
hunting for people for sex. But many
heterosexuals also do the same. A homosexual
hunts for people because he must. There is no
other alternative for him. But heterosexuals
do it simply in their greed for more. Yet they
are not seen with much disrespect. Nobody
hates them. They are not untouchable for
anybody. Prashant knows about a married
person having two children who, at the age of
about 45, has already done sex with more
than 35 ladies and proudly he keeps on
announcing this among his friends. Nobody
disrespects him, nobody hates him. People
talk to him normally though they are aware of
his habits. Even Prashant talks to him
normally since he treats Prashant with respect
and Prashant finds no reason to peep into his
personal life.
Prashant wants to advise the people that
whenever they come to see a homosexual,
then rather than hating or ridiculing him they
should think - Oh! He is a homosexual. He is
a very unfortunate person. He must be
passing very bad times. The God has deprived
him of the basic right given to all human
beings, animals, birds, and even insects.
Whereas I get it daily without any effort, he
has to hunt for it for days and months. Still
he gets only a few moments of crude
pleasure. He cannot love one with whom he
gets this pleasure. He cannot love anybody.
How miserable! I should talk to him with
sympathy and respect. Let us all take a pledge
that we human beings will rectify the mistake
which God does and keeps on doing. We will
give the right of marriage to them. They also
have every right to live like a human.
Homosexuals are also educated people. They
are not less than anybody else. They also
work for the society and take an equal part in
the betterment and progress of their nation.
The society fully enjoys the fruit of their
labour. But what does it give them in return?
Insults, abuses, hatred, tears, sorrows, and
sufferings! How can it be so selfish?
Prashant says - If you still think that
homosexuals are really dirty people, then
advise the Government to develop killing
centres for them where they are administered
a strong poison which kills them
instantaneously. The Government can charge
them for the cost of the poison and for
disposing the body. Either give a homosexual
his rights or kill him. There is no other
alternative.
Prashant warns - I was fortunate that right in
my days of puberty, I got a partner with
whom I was associated for 11 years. Most
homosexuals are not so fortunate.
Immediately after attaining the adulthood,
they start doing stray sex which goes on till
their death. A homosexual does sex with
hundreds of people in his life. Today Internet
has made it very easy for homosexuals to
meet.
In print media also some ads of homosexuals
have started appearing for searching partner
in the name of friendship. In future the
spread of AIDS and other STD's is going to be
very fast since almost all homosexuals
ultimately marry and thus women also get
infected. What the society doesn't realize is
that it is sitting on a volcano.
Prashant says - The only argument against
homosexuality is that it cannot produce
children. Do we need more children? What is
the biggest problem of mankind today? The
heterosexuals have created a havoc on earth.
Homosexuals constitute only about two
percent of any population. Others are
bisexuals and heterosexuals. What harm can
be caused if these two percent people do not
produce children? And if we really fall short
of people, the homosexuals will be ready to
donate their semen which can be used by any
desiring women to produce children by
artificial insemination. The medical science is
progressing. More ways of producing children
will be invented. There is already a talk of
human cloning. Why to force intercourse
between a homosexual and a heterosexual just
to produce a child? And what means do we
adopt for forcing such intercourse? We marry
them and ruin their lives!
Now Prashant has thought of a solution to his
problems. He owns a house in a good colony
of the city which is worth about forty lakhs of
Rupees. He also has about twenty lakhs of
Rupees in the form of shares and other
securities which is his life long saving. He also
owns a car and other household amenities.
Can he get a man who, in exchange of all this
wealth, might be ready to marry his wife and
give love of a father to his children? His wife
is very beautiful for her age and his children
are very sweet. Any bachelor or widower of
suitable age will be acceptable to Prashant
provided he loves Prashant's wife. Prashant
will distribute the money equally between his
wife and the man who agrees for this. Then
Prashant will travel to a distant city and will
stay in a hotel under an assumed name and
address.
He will then take an overdose of sleeping pills
and will die peacefully. Nobody will ever know
who died and why. A mistake which God did,
which the society could not correct, Prashant
is ready to rectify. He has set up a profile of
his wife with a matchmaking program on the
Internet describing his plan and he is waiting
for the responses.
There is not only one Prashant on this earth,
but millions. And many more will take birth.
How many more Prashants will have to
sacrifice their lives on the altar of your own
whims and fancies which you keep imposing
on others, before you wake up?
To how many more ladies will you deny their
basic right of getting love of their husbands
and make them lunatic, before you think?
By how many more persons will you
unnecessarily increase the population of this
already populous earth by forcing unwanted
marriages between homosexuals and
heterosexuals, before better sense prevails on
you?
And how many more children would you like
to grow physically and mentally retarded by
snatching away the love of their mother from
them, before you have mercy?
O heartless world, are you listening?</p>
