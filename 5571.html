<p>Now and then i read posts here about bisexual machos betraying gays...they have gfs and they use ur openings..and all..But there are few thngs i wanna say</p>
<p>1.90% of gays judge a guy on physical parameters..then its clear that its infatuation not love...</p>
<p>2.If u(gays) cross by a gym..u guys cn "fall in love" with the complete attendance there one by one...</p>
<p>3.How do you expect someone to openly entertain you when your parents wont if u were gay?(most cases)</p>
<p>4.How does "he fucked me" equal to "he used me"..if he fuckd u ..u got fuckd follows..wats usage here..?</p>
<p>5.Love has no gender but sex has predefined standards by nature...The golden rule of God holds tight that gay sex is unnatural and unethical...</p>
<p>Just sit calmly and do think yourself...</p>
<h1>GCI- I have problems with your fourth and fifth point.</h1>
<p>In the fourth one, using someone implies that a person faked love with a guy, imbibed feelings in him and had sex with him. When he was done with sex, former left the latter. That's what "he used me" means and it's not equal to "he fucked me".</p>
<p>Your fifth point reminds me of a certain Reverend who said the same thing on a debate in Times Now. And he got an awesome answer. Sex is not about pipes that fit together. It's a lot more than that. Noobs like you can never understand sex. And just so you know, guys have their G-Spot in their butts. Prostate gland, when stimulated, can give the best orgasm a guy can have. So, guys were meant to be fucked in the butt. Get over it bitch.</p>
