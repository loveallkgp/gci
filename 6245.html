<p>Male,20 Hi admin,loved ur work here.
2 yrs ago I met a guy here on GCI,he is the sweetest person and after talking to him for 1 yr i told him about my attraction towards him,during the same yr i was in a relationship with other guy who left me some days after,but i fell in love him, at that time he told me he doesn't likes me in that way,and left me alone for 8 months i suffered a lot during that time.He contacted me on New year's eve last year,I replied him and met him,and then this yr on VDay i proposed him,and he accepted,but in this 4 months he hardly gives me time,always i have to request him to meet me, he never calls me neither msgs me,I feel terrible sometimes,but still I love him for his honesty he is truely made for me.I can't imagine my life without him.please help me what should I do with such relationship,its breaking me frm inside?</p>
<h1>GCI- You leave the bitch and kick her away. That's what you should do. You cannot call it a relationship. This is not even a relationship. It's a pity that he is doing on you, that's what I feel. Moreover, why do you have to be a soppy eyed guy who needs a life support system? Don't you love yourself enough that you have to rely on others for survival?</h1>
<p>If the person doesn't love you back the way you do, there is not way hell that he is made for you. Plus, don't fall in love with every tom dick and harry on the roads you see(metaphoric roads) because that's what happens when you do.</p>
