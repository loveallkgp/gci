<p>I used to be very confused about my sexuality for some time. It badly affected my life. Everyday would be a living hell. I would go to sleep and pray that I don't wake up the next morning. I became completely secluded and lost many friends. Recently I finally accepted myself for who I am- I'm gay, at first I felt guilty, ashamed. Then I got to know about all the other guys in my position, this comforted me a lot. At first, I was very eager to have sex and met some guys. After a bit of fun, I would always cum and the longing for sex would go away. Then I realized, I just want the companionship and someone close to me. So I'm looking for a long term relationship now. I came into contact with some guys and now we are good friends. I've not met them. We just chat and speak to each other on the phone.
This is where I have a problem. I'm basically an introvert; I spend a lot of time alone. I love solitude, it helps me plan and think better. I prefer studying alone to group studies. I don't share very many things with my friends (straight or gay). But now with these new friends, they keep in touch constantly, I love that they show so much of interest in my life, at the same time I feel suffocated. I got to tell them what I ate, where I went, with whom I went, when I sleep, when I get up, etc.. I also have a friend who wants to know what I'm wearing everyday- right down to my inner wear. I feel like my personal space has been invaded and I want to break free, but I don't want to lose their friendship. Am I ready for a relationship? Am I crazy? What do I do? Totally confused. :(</p>
<h1>GCI- You are not crazy at all. No matter how many friends you have you always need some personal space for yourself. It is required for your self mental growth. You cannot always live alone and you can't have too much time with your friends. Even when you are in a relationship which includes a 100% involvement of someone in your life, you should get some time for yourself. So you just have to adjust your priorities accordingly. Too much of a good thing isn't healthy either. Don't go for a relationship if you are forced into it. Go when you are ready for it mentally and let it happen with a flow. Be calm and be happy. :)</h1>
