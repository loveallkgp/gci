<p>hello all 
I need ur suggestion.
kuch din pehle ek ladhki ne mujhe propose kiya. she is very good friend of mine. I told her that I need some time .But yesterday I called her and refused her proposal. she asked me why I have rejected her . Then I told her that I can't tell u.
I took that decision because she is very good girl and I don't want to cheat her . 
whether I have done right or wrong thing. Because everybody ask me why I don't want to be in a relationship. For sometime I thought that I should accept her proposal. but I thought that I don't have any right to hurt any girl. But I don't know what reason I should give everyone for this.
please give me your advice.</p>
<h1>GCI- U need to chill out, drink some shots of tequila and take some freaking fucked up selfies!</h1>
<p>On a serious note u need not to worry about her, all u need to think is about urself and not cheat anyone in future bcoz of ur sexuality. Goodluck!</p>
