<p>Someone wrote a gay confession on TCS confession page.
and everyone started bullying him. it goes on like.</p>
<p>"He is a contractor and works in my project. He is so manly; kind heart; active person; I used to prepare sweets and bring for him frequently, he loves to eat and comes to my room in weekends for lunch. He likes my company.
One day I proposed him in my room but he scolded me left the place since we are same gender. I'm so worried and took one day leave but from next day, he is as usual and started behaving with me as if nothing happened.
I don't know what to do? but I love him a lot, want to be with him till my last breath. "
FRNDS we know that our people dont have the balls to accept us. 
Then why do we need to confess in a wrong place.
:/ If you want to say anything say it only here.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hmmmm..I agree that a right demand must be put in front of the ryt kind of people..otherwise it is a sheer waste of time.( But as they say...No one knows what exactly is right or wrong unless we see the repercussions).</h1>
