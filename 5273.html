<p>Recently, i have lost my self control, of which i was really proud. And the result of losing this is pretty disastrous in my life.</p>
<p>The thing is that there's this guy who is my best friend and my love. He isn't gay and hence he doesn't love me. He was a bit doubtful of my sexual orientation and to put me to test, he had sex with me. We did it four times, or of which first one was a bet and rest were initiated by him and after the fourth time, he never initiated but this had made me lose my self control and i made moves on him 6-7 times since then but it would happen if u was drunk or in sleep because of these complications in our past, i had told him that i love him and all he expects me to do in order to keep everything normal is to kill all my feelings for him.</p>
<p>Naturally, i couldn't kill my feelings but had been trying really hard to hide it and deal with it so that i don't end up losing my friend. He is one of those few people in my life who i wasn't in my life forever and want to be by his side forever and ever. I thought i was successful in it because two months ago when we met, we got drunk and i didn't make a move on him but we meet again this past weekend, and we all got drunk really badly and to my dismay i made the same mistake again, i got on top of him, touched his dick and ass.i feel like killing myself and i mean it literally.</p>
<p>Can you suggest me any ways to keep myself in control. He is really kind but I can't expect him to continue to be so if I keep on doing such stupid things. Few things that I have thought of to keep myself in check is to talk less with him, about him, not to think about him all the time and also I was supposed to meet him again after 15 days but I have canceled that plan because I am really afraid.
There's one more thing which is wrong is that even though all of this has happened we haven't talked in full about all these things, he just avoids it.
Suggestions and criticisms are welcomed. </p>
<h1>GCI- Do not get drunk with him the next time. You should really try to focus on the reality rather than what you want.</h1>
