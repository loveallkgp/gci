<p>FLamboYanT Bacchaaa here ,</p>
<p>i see a lot if sissies ganging up against bisexuals here, i mean dont hate the devils for their choice of sins, it feels GOOD to be BAD and technically a guy can be in love with a girl and a guy at the same time..........i mean if the 2 guys and a girl are comfortable with it, then who the heck are you losers to judge? or if one is an only son and is required to continue the legacy ? if a relationship outside marriage can keep everything happy then who has the right to point fingers? (FYI im not against anyone whatsoever, just the "self righteous gay" people who hate bisexuals,you people do realise youre just as bigoted as the homophobes? its a CHUTZPAH pardoy rofl lmao)</p>
<p>bisexuals are devils own spawns sent to eart to have the most sinful sweet fun and theyre unchained...on the loose, and they reek of apples of sin </p>
<h1>GCI- One more butthurt ego filled person who is no better than gay people who abused bisexuals. When you abuse someone for being a certain way, know that you are not better than them. You just land in their boat and sail their way.</h1>
<p>Anyway, I have had enough of these hate confessions on this page. Respect people's personal choice guys. You cannot be the moral police for anyone! Although I'd like to give some points out here.</p>
<p>For gay guys-
If you do have any problem with bisexuals, don't date one. Don't even talk with one. When you are at the initial stage of conversation, make sure about what you want by talking about it. Like, "what do you expect, friendship or relation?". Ask the person about like what does he will do if he is in love with a guy deeply and passionately, would he have guts to carry it forward? If the answer is negative, then depart peacefully and leave the person be. There is no hard and fast rule to first fall in love and then let things happen. When they fall apart, you cry and whine about why it happened and curse the bisexuals. Make things clear beforehand.</p>
<p>For bisexuals-
Yes, you can love both. But loving someone and having double standards are two separate things. When you love someone stick to it. Do not leave them just because you can get married. Cheating in any form is bad. I am not preaching morality but it doesn't really good on the part of people that when you can marry a woman but have sex side by side with the other sex. You will be the first one to shout if you wife is caught having extra marital affair. So if you fall in love, make sure it lasts.</p>
<p>Okay, case closed. I will not be posting anything like this again about hatred. I guess the guy who wrote "I think admin has the secret agenda to promote against bisexuals" or something like that might have my answer now.</p>
