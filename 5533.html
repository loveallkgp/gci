<p>I'm a 25 year old guy. I commute daily via metro to my college, which is in Faridabad (I de-board at badarpur and travel via auto the remaining part). On the way, there're long barren fields covered by trees and heavy bushes, where village people go and poop in the morning (I've seen a few while passing by). One day, while returning from the college, I was getting horny and decided to take a poop myself (in anticipation that men will take a look at my junks...). So I asked auto driver to stop there. It was around 3 pm. I went inside the fields. I pulled my trousers down and sat there. After around 20 minutes, I found a man of around 30 yrs age coming near the place where I was sitting. To my utter surprise, he started urinating facing towards me (exposing his dick). I started looking at other direction, purporting that I was just doing my business and not interested to see his show. To my second surprise, he took his pants down and sat beside me. He started making 'kissing voices' as if he was hungry for me. I said - "kya hai?" He made a gesture from his head, signalling me to come near him. I got frightened and nervous. I stood up, pulled my pants up and ran away. This was so horrifying. He seemed like a mental person. Since then I've not dared to go there!</p>
