<p>HelLo evEryOne
here my confession goes-
I hAte mYseLf.
AftEr a lOng inTervAl oF tiMe I hAve gOt a rEal n TruE Guy.
But the thing is i'm in Delhi n he is in Keral.
We're in long distance relationship since from 9th may.
I miss him everY single sec.
I know that I lOVe hIm so mUch.
But whenEver i fEEl lOnely I usEd to call my fb frds.
EvEry dAy i die just bcz i'm so far from him n i can't able to cuddle him.
Nor even i can touch him.
More ever we can do only video chat.
I know that he is the rg8 match for me.
But i can't stop my self.
Sometimes it feels like i can get a better prs than this.
But for the very next time i stop n think that No i can't get a real n true lover like him.
He really cares a lot.
He loves me from his bottom of heart.
He believes that i'm his life.
I also feel the same.
But at end i'm so sacred of loosing him since we're so far.
Sometimes i feel like koi delhi wala hi relationship k liye sahi rhta.
But i know its not true.
I love him.
I love him so much.
Never want to ditch him.
I want to be loyal with him.
But what should i do. I don't know.
How can i draw this thinking out of my mind that long distance won't work so easily.
I want him to say that plz give me some more time. So that i can make myself so strong. But whenever i say this to him he become so emotional n start crying.
Today its our 18 th day.
I want more time to make myself understand that long distance relationships are much n more better than others.
At last i wanna say
THIS IS true LOVE.
I love u my DUMBO.</p>
