<p>Hey admins..!! love u both.. :P
Well..!! Will it be, me running from my responsibilities by marrying a guy... cuz I think if I marry a guy den I have to live a independent life... nd wat happens to my mum nd dad wen dey get old?? :( :( Confused..!!</p>
<h1>GCI : marriage is just formality .. !  a social norm to show the registry of you partners that they are taken . nothing else</h1>
<p>and why do you think there is any need to leave your parents and to live independent life  ( and wife are people too , they aren't caretakers ... in any form its you who will take care of your parents not your wife or husband . you are meant to take care of your parents in either way and if you think marrying a girl mean getting a caretaker for your parents in old age without wage .. you need  to rethink your standards .. not being judgemental )</p>
<p>and gay marriage doesn't mean that one has to leave their parents to live with another . i mean you two can live with your parents and just come to each others home whenever you want . watching tv , spending time , eating food , sleeping , playing and much more the  go back home live independent .</p>
