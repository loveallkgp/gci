<p>hey frnds.. m frm gujrat.. dis is nt a confession bt want to share my condition wid u all. weeks ago i read in comments abt gay episode of emotional atyachar n i just watched it last night on youtube. Now problem is dat, its d same story of mine except that i dint let know my family abt my sexuality nor did any loyality test bt it reminded me of how badly i ws cheated over my relationship. Now my past is running through me since last night n m being panic a lot, meanwhile m feeling low for the lead, Nishant Sharma. Being extremely desperate and unstable to meet or talk to him. I found his fb id n hv buzzed him, bt yet nt got any response, hv sent friend request too. Just hoping for well, its being very unstable condition for me. Its gonna b like hell feeling for weeks...</p>
<h1>GCI- Calm down darling. Break ups are hard to deal with and you know it well. You can understand his condition as well and the situation he went through might have had him through enough of it. Don't pressurize him. Focus on yourself and try to get busy with stuff that actually matters in your life right now.</h1>
