(acctually she did not see us in my room so she started searching).. she saw and immedietly ran away started screeming and crying.. i helped my friend to escape.. then my dad came from office, she told my dad about this.. he did not said anything.. i m scared and my mom was continuously asking why i had done this? that time i pretend becoz i was scared that my dad gonna beat me.. next day my dad called my elder brother and told him about this incident.. my bro called me the same day and said not to do it again in our garden,if our neighbour would see that then we gonna loose our self respect,bla bla..my mom is still homophobic after that i discussed with her about homosexuality.. i dont know my dad's point off view about homosexuality,he said nothing to me and his behaviour didn't change yet towards me. </p>
