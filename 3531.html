<p>Reply to the the few people who gave comment on confession no #3516.I saw confession no #3516 where a bottom guy put his desire to dressup like a guy n give surprise to his bf on a romantic date.
@ Admin : i would love to know frm you what was so sarcastic about that ? Dressing as a girl is his desire so wts sarcastic in that ?
@Others : I saw many people commented saying Its spoils the images of homosexuals,Come on boy, this is ridiculous n others who made fun of him.
I still wondering when did he mention that he is homosexual(Gay).Seems people r not aware of other sexualties around them like bisexuals transexuals and pansexuals are few where such things are liked.If u people dnt like nything doesn't mean it is a matter of joke.We all hv diffrnt tastes diffrnt opinions.Nobody is same as other.U people talk of equality n Lov frm society n blame them for nt letting u to male love or get married with guy and discrminating making fun of the person of ur own community(LGBT).Being gay is perfectly fine.We do understand u dnt like girly guys,sissies,trans girls bt this doesn't mean u hv right to make fun of them .Its like hetrosexual making fun of gays bcz generaly they dnt like gay people .Likewise gay peple r doing here on public flat just bcz they dnt like feminine guys trans or girls.So with ur this pathetic behavious u people gonna get equality ???</p>
<p>Well this is me Kritika singh,transgender,many might remembr me.I just wanna say Discrimination at its height in our community.Gays dnt like girls sissies.Does it mean that lesbians n trans should be out of the community ?? Lesbians dnt like guys.Does it means gay should be out of the fight of equality ?? Nobody is asking u all to get married or make love with girls or sissies(in case u r gay) but consider evryone a part of one community.We all r same with same feelings.Just our tastes differs which doesn';t mean u hv a right to mock discrminate or hate others with people of diffrnt taste.</p>
<p>to those people who were mentioning gay homo in their comments.Guys there r many other sexualities besides this.Update urself.If he had mention gay in his post then it would hv been okay.He knws his bf's likings better than you people thats y he chose to do that so y to mention gay homo in comments.Self-asummptions are very bad here.Sorry bt i felt upset with the comments full of immaturity n stupidity which had no base</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, you still didn't get the sarcasm. #Fail. You are free to dress however you want. I am all for equality. But there has to be logic in the statement, right?</h1>
<p>You might want to read your last confession again. It said " is there any place that provides girl clothes for bottom?" Yeah sure, I guess the shops that say, "All bottoms come here if you wanna get woman dresses" are around every corner, right? Can't you just go to a woman's store to buy dresses that you like? If you can be so fabulous, what's holding you back? And please don't do that LGBT equality rights stuff with me. I know what to write in a particular situation.</p>
