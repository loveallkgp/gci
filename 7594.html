<p>Today, I hv did chatting with one person. He told me that  He hv boyfriend... Both r loving to eachother alot. Further I asked him abt future, he told that they both hv planning to marry with girls. N both r happy with their decision. How can I explain him to Fight with society or how can I change their thoughts??? Due to such people lgbt community is still behind</p>
<h1>GCI- Idiots, the both of them. They are going to ruin the lives of people around them, especially of those girls. You cannot actually make them do the thing that you think is right. They have to observe it themselves and realize it. As a matter of fact, you can try to hide the dirt under the carpet, but one day you have to face the music of it.</h1>
