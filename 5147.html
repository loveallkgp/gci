<p>My first ever confession. Forgive me, but this is going to be very long. I never talked about this to anyone and maybe just letting it out here might help me feel lighter. It may not make sense to few people.</p>
<p>I am 20 years old, from Guwahati, Assam. Way back in January 2009, I made a gay account on Orkut and started talking to people. I was 14 years old then . On February 2009 I met this guy. We had the same name. Let's call him A. We kept chatting and chatting for hours. By the first 3 months we were already best buddies. Now, I was already in a relationship with a guy. So when "A" proposed to me, I politely said no. But we continued talking and being friends. Now, he was from Shillong, which is just 3 hours ride from my city. After knowing each other for 6 months, he came to visit me in Guwahati. We went out for lunch, for trips and had a lot of fun. He was an amazing guy. He would keep visiting every month . This continued for 3 years. But at the end of 2010, he called me up and told me that he had got a job in a foreign country in a big company, and he was leaving soon. I was a bit sad that we won't be meeting anymore, but I was happy too for him. He did not give me his new number as it would be impossible to make such expensive calls. Instead we would chat on yahoo messenger. We would try to adjust to each others' time zones. I would stay up very late at night to chat with him, because of the time zones. In around March of 2011, he stopped coming online regularly. He told me he was busy. I would come online everyday, but he wouldn't be online. I did not bother him. But on May, at around 2 pm, I got a call on my phone from "A"s shillong wala number, which was strange. I picked it up. It was "A"'s friend. He told me A was in ICU and he had been pretending the entire foreign job story as he had cancer and he did want me to see him in treatment. The man was saying more things, but I disconnected the phone. I was so shocked. And devastated. I immediately blocked his number from my phone, deleted my orkut, facebook, yahoo account. And then I cried a lot. The very next day I applied for a new sim card. I never got contacted again. I did not try to contact him too. Now I ask myself why I did it. I still don't know. And it doesn't make any sense. I was a kid . I was heart broken and surprised. I was emotional mess. I broke up with my boyfriend too because I realised I didn't really love him. And I removed all signs of "A" from my life. I thought maybe if I didn't think or talk about it, I would be able to forget it, or maybe just pretend that it didn't happen to me, but to someone else. I pretend now to be very strong. I also never had any boyfriend after that .</p>
<p>But even now, I see something or read something and it makes me remember "A". I just read a post on cancer on this page and it made me remember him and I cried again. I just wish I could delete those few years from my life. Somehow, I am unable to love or trust people, no matter how close they are just because of this. </p>
<h1>GCI- Exactly... why you did this? Whatever you did was not really required and it was so immature. But you were young at that point. Now is the time to not repeat mistakes. Just let the things be and start with something new.</h1>
