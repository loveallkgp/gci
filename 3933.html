<p>Bohot kuch bolna hota h aur baar baar confession likh vi ni sakte, dts why it becomes quite long :p
this confession is completely related to #3910 n there comments.
   A little knowledge is a very dangerous thing. Anyways I really don't like 2 interfere with people's comment but u knw, sometime we have 2 interfere just 2 clear ur confusion/misunderstanding which will help u/me/us. A commentator wrote "u can find any number of NE guys calling people in Delhi 'u indians' in their face AS IF WE INDIANS HAVE OCCUPIED ENTIRE NORTHEAST."
   Baat samjh me aye lekin analyse karne me fail ho gaye ho seriously. They called u 'u indians' in what way may b u dont hav ny idea. Kitne pain k saath kehta hoga. Ask them where they belong to then ? The answer with pride will be "I am an Indian" :D may b u will find it funny but yaha feelings k saath kitna kuch hide h u probable dont know. But u should've known atleast 4 BEING AN INDIAN. Capital of INDIA is DELHI. Dont u get ? It's INDIA, INDIA's capital.
     Inner line permit is an official travel document issued by d GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Some states people feel they need it. Aur ye kyu necessary h iske liye book padhna padega aapko. Write from d experience, information bagera mat likh diya karo issue banake :D. "Stop playing victim role" abb is sentence k baare me main kiya bolun :D. Kuch ni bolna mujhe n from bottom of my heart m sorry for interfering with u so much but i was hurt when u said me      Inner line permit is an official travel document issued by d GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Some states people feel they need it. Aur ye kyu necessary h iske liye book padhna padega aapko. Write from d experience, information bagera mat likh diya karo issue banake :D.

 "I love my India. This feeling is missing in NE people". Really ? Go to ladakh n ask d uneducated people they will reply MY INDIA IS BEST. Kuch to accha likh diya karo bhai log. Nothing can be worse than for an Indian to prove that they r Indian.                                         One thing I want 2 share with u, in a quiz competition I was paired with a guy, n qu was asked what is India's national language ? N d guy so fastly replied HINDI. N d ans was wrong. Do u know HINDI is not our national language ? There's no national language in India. There should be n this too should be HINDI. But India stands somewhere no other country eligible to stand there. India's motto "Unity in Diversity". 
    When I was in Germany along with 50 students from various country for a project, a guy from Newzealand appreciated our education system n said he scared 2 come India. Aise koi bolega to obviously gussa aayega. But what's his fault ? India n Pakistan k jagda dekho. Aur foreign country me friendship dekho. Bas humare point of view accha hona chahiye aur thoda calm vi rehna chahiye. If I am bad dn u have 2 b gud. Life me success aur happy rehne ka yehi ek best tarika h. Me aise logo se vi mila hun jo saara pocket money bhikhari ko de dete h n they r just student of medical scie</p>
