<p>request to admin pls.... post my views...mostly boys use to pass commets after see a gay and any kinner....and many1 use to fuck them and gets blowjob.....after all that they says they r bi-sexual...i wanna say to all these peoples...pls.. dont play with emotions of gays and kinnars...who know ..? may b you have to face your son on next time who is also a gay...and one thing more never forget that bi-sexuality is also a subsitute of gay class..thanx...</p>
<h1>Viv- LOL! Your last line!! And i think that bi's are just gays who are afraid to hold hands with guys in public. But then again i must not be prejudiced. A few days ago i heard of the news where a gay guy and a eunuch were molested by policemen repeatedly. The gay guy was so much depressed that he committed suicide. These testimonies were told in SC before the judgement. Its all horrible to think about that how many are molested and yet we are the criminals.</h1>
