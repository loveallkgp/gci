<p>Hii, I'm in first month of college and I'm enjoying it watching these beautiful guys all the time. I particularly liked one of these sexies, he is tall, fair, sexy athletic body, always smiling and active guy, he always has a special treatment from gals and I used to stare at him everywhere. He knew I'm looking at him, one day while I'm having lunch and staring at him he suddenly looked at me, I got nervous and tried to pretend I was looking something else, he smiled and looked away. One day, we are taking books from a counter which is very crowded, we all got squeezed to get to the counter, while I'm struggling and waiting near the counter I felt a warm tight hug from behind, I looked back, its him I'm so surprised and he kept his arms around my waist and hugged me so tight in the crowd, his perfume was so mesmerising and that smell is all over me, he kept his head on my shoulder, I enjoyed the moment and we came out of that counter after taking books. Then he again looked at me and said finally we got the books.. I too smiled and said ur perfume is so nice. He gave a weird expression and walked away. Then onwards I became so nervous what did I do, what did it look like, later I tried to stare at him again he saw me doing that and left that place. Thats hurting me a lot. I was so stupid. Now I can't even look at him.. :(</p>
<h1>GCI- Next time don't listen to Teenage dreams by Katy perry and yes it is obvious that he ain't interested in u in any way rather than being just an acquaintance because he seems homophobic and a bit confused as to how to deal with u. Next time U see him just pretend as if he doesn't exist. Lastly snap out of ur stupid teenage stuff ..he ain't the only hot bod around!?</h1>
<p>N.B- If u try to stare at people no matter he is strt gay or bi that guy will get freaked out. No one like to be ogled until they enjoy or reciprocate.</p>
