<p>Hiii friends</p>
<p>I feel really low . I don't know why ... it's not because m a virgin . But because I m single ...I had a lot of bfs before like many ..but no body could mark their feet on my heart ... I play a role of a cupid here on fb ... but no body knows how lonely I m . I have tried many way to deviate my mind but always at the end my heart and mind hunts love of my life .. I m 19 and very single ... I just don't know how m I suppose to live my life till the fullest .. even I wanna walk along with my man on the sand by holding his hands . Even I wanna feel his cuddlings and hugs and his warmth while we sleep ...</p>
<p>guys lion might be brave and strong but he at the end of his day is the loneliest person in this world ....</p>
<p>Just the same way .. I might comment like an " aunt of 1950's " but dude I m a human being with a heart ..and I too feel lonely . I know I m just 19 and I should more concentrate over my career but kiya kare Ye dill bichara nadan hai .. jab b dekho ik handsome sa , sophisticated sa , well to do with sa pyaar khoj ta rehtha hai .. you I m not that bad ... even I cry really bad at times for love . But nobody here knows ... ki yaar jo sabse mazbooth hota hai emotionally sabre kamzor b vo hi hota hai ... </p>
<h1>GIC- Again, why do you have to think that you are lonely or don't have anyone? Its just the thinking process that makes us sad. Our world becomes on what our brain thinks. So you can think a lot of positive stuff, can you not?</h1>
