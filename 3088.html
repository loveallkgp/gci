<p>I knew a guy fr 4yrs nw, we got so close in a very less time we are even physically so intimate, he says we would be friends forever and that he is so lucky to have me. I thought he is the one for me and I never felt attracted to anyone else but him after I met him, I never got a pblm with his sexuality besides he never talked to me abt hot girls or something like others do. the problem now is I feel jealous whenever he spends time wid others, these days things have changed he suddenly started chatting too much on fone and ignored me, I don't even remember the last time we hugged. he nw thinks I'm boring.. I ws so obsessed with those chats and somehow managed to look into his conversations, that moment still haunts me and makes me cry helplessly every night, he was having sex chat with a girl and was flirting with 2 other girls.. I didn't know why he wanted to keep it as a secret from me. I was so humiliated and thought of giving up on him, so picked up a date and went for a hook up, but dat went really bad, I'm not at all attracted to anyone other than him and its really hard to give up on him over night. I'm feeling like I'm going to be stuck with these feelings forever. I'm in a very responsible profession in d society but I'm least interested in my life. I've tried many ways to put something above his thoughts but none helped me. I sometimes even pray the God to let me die and put me out of this misery.</p>
<h1>GCI- Don't worry, you will come out of it. Just be out of his contact. He is a player who things from his dick head rather than his brain. It would be better if you get love first and then sex and not the otherwise. Its the latter that got landed you in this situation.</h1>
