<p>I am a 28 year guy and I met one guy on facebook one month ago. He was of 29 years. We chated for few days and then decided to meet personally! In the last 15 days, we have met 4 times and had sex. We both enjoyed but the problem is that now he is leaving India. At first he used to text and call me now and then. But now, he doesn't reply to my texts. I also got to know that he is married. I don't know why I am so upset now! Whenever I am alone, my mind is occupied by his thoughts and I start crying. Plz, give me suggestions to come out from these feelings. I want to live my life as before !</p>
<h1>GCI- He is married. I guess this should be enough for you to forget him.</h1>
