<p>First of all I would like to salute who involved behind this great GCI. its really awesome.. !
I'm a 23 yr old st8 woman. my male friend told me about his orientation 4 days back. I decided to know about this world so only I'm here with my fake id. i just want to support him in all the ways.. suggest me what kind of support does he actually need? he badly confused to handle his lover and too affectionate family members ! I'm asking this as a good friend not as ex girl friend or lover ! ! </p>

<h1>GCI- WOOOO! Great GCI sun ke dil bagh bagh ho geya! Xoxo!</h1>
<p>Now you and your friend must be very very close and he must trust you beyond limits to tell you about his orientation. What he needs is is support, feeling of equality, non-judgmental and non-discrimination attitude. Let him know that nothing has changed and your bond has increased. What you should not do is go and tell others. Ask him if he is comfy that some other person should know or not. Also if he is not much educated about the whole "being gay" scenario, you could help him out. You'd be surprised that many gay are not at all aware about the whole aspect of what it means to be gay. What basically you have to understand that a gay person undergoes a lot of internal turmoil during their acceptance period and many are a lot sensitive and emotionally imbalanced which in turn can have a less confident life. This can result in a difficult relationship and improper family communication which is exactly happening to your friend. So he needs a LOT of mental support from you. You really are a very good friend who is making so much efforts to support him. God bless you!</p>
<p>PS- The other thing you can do is talk about boys when you both have free time and see which guy in the park or mall has bigger butt size! :p</p>
