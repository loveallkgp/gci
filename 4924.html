<p>hello all... i am from mysore and i am 21 .I want to tell you my story ,i had huge crush on this guy and i thought he liked me too .we are in same class and our homes are near to each outher so v use to go to college together ,study together for exam and even some time we went to shoping together . I thought i was damn lucky to have him but things turned out wrong after a year are so because he changed ,he even started ignoreing me and i was in such a emotional pain that time .After he started acting all "self centered creature ",i stoped talking to him and soo i was draged into even more emotional pain.Their was no 1 to blame but myself because i trusted him too much ..... n i "thought" he like me too , but niw I am getting over him </p>
<h1>GCI- Great!</h1>
