<p>Reply to Confession #3425 
Anonymous Soul in Silent pain..... 
I was 11 when it First happened, my cousin who must ave been 16 then,told me "lets play a game that makes you lucky" i said okay,a crazy loud chubby fair kid with a flair for adventure....that was the biggest mistake of my life.....he took me to the penthouse of the house,and into the attatch bathroom....he closed the lights and told me to put his dick on my lips,i said no because its where urine comes from,he forced me,i wish i had the courage and sense to bite off his balls then,i froze...,cowardice overtook me,that was my downfall.....he overpowered me,i was crying and yet he had no mercy,he didnt back off....he was saying only to hold it in my mouth for a minute until "good oil" comes out,i didnt know what that meant back then,my mind was racing in panick one moment but as he held my head and pushed past my lips,my mind went blank....i was like a dead body,i couldnt move,i was lying on the floor....he was pushing in and out,it must have been more than 20 minutes....he finally "came in my mouth" i was crying and i vomited by impulse,i didnt sleep the whole night, the whole night id get out of my bed and brush,i brushed countless times until my gums bled,i had this icky feeling that it was still there,from next day on he threatened me that he will tell everyone that i made him do it(i didnt even know what SEX was then,but i was afraid of shame),he would take me to that place daily,even four times a day,it happened for two weeks daily,because i remember my colouring book was finished,it had 15 pages left.....i drew a picture and coloured it daily,mostly tigers and planes....one day when everybody went to a funeral,he took me to his room,told me to lie down on it....on my stomach, and remove my shorts, and he wanted to "lie" on me, i was glad i didnt have to kiss and suck his big ugly brown leather rod,he revoved my t shirt from behind and was rubbing something warm and rubbery on my toilet place(my thoughts exactly then) i was thinking why is he doing it? But by then i stopped thinking any objection to whatever he did,he spit on his hands and touched me there on my buttcrack,i was thinking what was gonna happen,it was feeling slippery back there, he was actually rubbing up and down,but all of a sudden a jolt of thundering pain what felt like throbbing and burning....i let out a scream and he was shocked,the pain was too much and he stopped,i was kicking and moving wildly not because i wanted him to stop,it was because The burning pain was Unbearable....it took me a day or two to just sit comfortable,i couldnt walk,i ended up with High Fever ,id cry all the time.....my momma took me to a doctor and i had to take shit fuarked up medicine,however it took me about a week and a half to get off my fever,everyone said i lost too much weight because of the fever....i got well but stayed quiet, but after a couple of days of feeling better,He was back, he took me to his room and undressed me,make me lick his cock,meanwhile he would play with my chest....i would get a "weird tingly" sensation,he would then make me lie on my stomach,id resisted and cried saying No...,it will pain,he said this time it wont,he held my hands pinned to the bed,and keep his penis on my buttcrack and rub it,i was expecting the "burn" any instant,but he didnt penetrate me,it was a dry hump,he started doing it everyday after that,and it became normal for me....as usual my mind would shut down and i would close my eyes,i still remember that tears dripped down through even closed eyes......he did that for 3 months or so,he would call it "lucky game",we left india after that,i was in a new city,new school.....similar incidents happened as i would ride my bike,those 3 guys would somehow find me every week......but i didnt know it was wrong,it seemed routine for me....that id say in part 2....there are 4 parts,and i am now 22 years old, if uve read so much or even if the admin posts this long confession,please keep in mind that this is not written to gather attention in any way,i dont want you to feel sorry for me,because sympathy is for losers....i Just wanted you to know what a childs mind goes through when hes in trauma,how his brain gets wired up.......... How long it stays and haunts....its like i try to run from this darkness,yet it manages to follow me like a shadow.....please,encourage people and educate children regatding such issues,no matter what age...teach them that they should share everything sans fear any incident,teach them the DIFFERENCE between "GOOD TOUCH &amp; BAD TOUCH",even if one person reads this and manages to save or help someone,ill think my relating this whole ordeal was worth it....for the pen with which i write has tears in it instead of ink</p>
