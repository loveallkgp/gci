<p>Hi there everyone, Im punjabi guy in my late 20's. I migrated overseas with my family 10+ years ago. I am out to my family and they love me just the way i am and want me to settle down with the rite guy. i was in 3 years relationship 4 years ago. I have been single since then it was quite a difficult break up for me to handle he was my first love, i dint how to handle my self when i found out few days after our breakup that he replaced me with someone else (how someone can do that after 3 years relationship?) i went into depression, was on medication for more then 3 months. Since then i find really hard to go on dates or trust anyone. i am scared that my next relationship wont last long and i would have to start all over again. I only like indian guys (prefer punjabi) coz i want someone who understand my culture and who can communicate with my family in my mother tongue. There arnt many indian gay guys where i live and most of them are on student visa ( not that i mind that) and are quite young, I prefer someone who has been through up's and down's through his life and will do anything to make a relationship work. I was in india 6 months back and went on few dates but i felt that guys in india are very scared to come out to their families and are willing to waste their own life for their family happiness. I would like to say to these guys your mum n dad will always love you no matter what your sexual orientation is, of course they will be disappointed but trust me you will always be their son, so dont waste your life and dont give up on your dreams. Secondly i felt most of the guys in india dont really know how they sud behave on their first date and what they sud say or sudnt say to make the right impression they act like they are very mature and they know everything in the world, its not a nice look when you are meeting your potential life patner be down to earth and be friendly as much as you can and try to make the other person feel comfortable around you. I just wish it was bit easy to find that right person to settle down with it is a difficult world out there and in gay relationship people change bf's like they change underwear. I have nearly given up on my search to find a bf, its time i start a new chapter in my life and start pursuing my dream to be a dad (through surrogacy), its kinda sad that my kid/kids will only have one dad but i will make sure that i am the best dad i can be for them. I hope you learnt something from confession, be strong being gay is not easy, dream big and do your best to achive them and be the best person you can be. Good luck and i hope you all find happiness </p>
<h1>GCI- Most of the people here don't know what dating is. The process to fall in love in most of the cases is a few days texting or sex, or both. Later they don't feel compatible so they have break up and then they say that "Loyalty is not there in gay people." To be in a relation a person should always see if the other guy is even compatible to be in a relationship or not.</h1>
<p>Anyways, to the confessor, you will find someone soon who will really trigger your love feelings and love glands. Your views are amazing. Att de kaint!</p>
