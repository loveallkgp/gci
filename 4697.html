<p>Hii folks!
I am a 19 year old gay guy. Came out to my parents recently. Going to come out to my friends in a couple of days.
The thing is i am from a different place and i study at a different place. I get long vacations when i spend my time at my place of residence or at some other place. And after the vacations end i return to the place where i study.</p>
<p>The thing is i want to date guys, to see whether i can proceed with sm1, want to find love! A partner!</p>
<p>But i know i am not going to stay here at my place of study forever therefore i hesitate in dating sm1 from here coz if i enter into a relationship with sm1 from here after 1-2 year i will leave this place.
Similarly if i try to find my love from the place where i live i m unable to be present there with him.
And long distance relationships r so easy to get broken. Ppl just get bored after some time nd start seeking sm1 else if they find guy at there place only. Why wud any1 like to have an online long distance relationship when 1 can have a relationship at his own place only. One has a lot of desires, definitely sexual also which cannot be satisfied if ur love is far from u. And no one wud refuse sex from an another guy if you want to give relief to ur hormones just bcoz u r in a long distance relationship with sm1 who can't come to u!!</p>
<p>I am matured nd ready enough to be in a relationship if it's a very close nd strong bond nd i know it's a stable bond. I can have a long distance relationship. But i can't expect na from sm1 else to be in a long distance relationship where even I don't know when will we meet!!</p>
<p>And after my college ends even i don't know at which place j will be! So, i find it so difficult where to seek my love. I can't expect sm1 to suppress his sexual or romantic desires(if he can satisfy them with sm1 else-after all he is also a human) just bcoz I, his lover, is.not there with him. Confused.
I had a relationship in past. He was from my place of residence only. He was staying there in PG nd was originally from a nearby district. It was a very great relationship, though i broke up with him. We both were very committed but still sometimes his grief wud come before me like "u give me ur love in installments to me"(No he didn't mean SEX in it). J also felt bad for him. He had once had given a blow job to his dearest friend nd was honest enough to tell me that. I was also understanding enough to understand that his intentions were not bad nd it happened at the heat of the moment.
And it was never an issue between us ever. Oyr b'up too happened bcoz of an altogether different reason.</p>
<p>But one doesn't get guys like this again nd again. And i fear my love may leave me in future for sm1 else coz of our long distance relationship. I know the reason is logical, after all one needs a physical touch lots of times. But u know, it's almost impossible to find a guy like this coz i really want to be in a stable relationship, in fact, in a marriage. And right now I'm only talking abt my situation. He cud have issues as well. What if both of us don't want to leave our parents nd expect the other to come nd settle at our own respective place, han?</p>
<p>And though i am out to my parents, friends etc. But i don't know if i ever will come out in my college. So, i can't evn date guys FREEly at my place of studying.</p>
<p>Uff.
I hv great friends from other places. But again the point is OTHER places nd i don't even hv a stable place where i stay. I keep moving. Uh. Uh.</p>
<p>(It has bcome too long, so not editing. Grammar nazis plz show ur mercy).</p>
