<p>"Ok,so this is my very first confession over here.
Well,I broke up with my boyfriend of 10 months a few months ago.It was a long distance relationship and though we did love each other,we were never able to put aside the issues that were arising exponentially with each passing day.He's going to United States next month and he wanted me to wait for him for 2-3 years(a.k.a Enact a real life version of Channing Tatum's ""Dear John).At that time I wasn't sure whether I was capable of that sort of commitment.I mean I'm just 19 and he already lived 1000 miles away.The idea of him going away overseas freaked me out I guess.And so because of that and several other issues-I broke up with him in April.I had my exams going on at that time so I didn't brood much over the whole issue and I even tried out some rude,mean facades to make him hate me.But I did get to the ""Post Breakup Syndrome"",after my exams ended.Now it was his turn to hurt me-and hurt he did.
He is the only guy I've looked up at times when I needed him the most.I knew I was wrong to break up with him and I've been messaging him ever since since mid-June-asking for forgiveness.But he rarely ever replies now.Part of me was happy that he'd probably moved on,but the other part was just plain sad.I longed for his company more than anything else,but he never cared enough to say a simple,""Hello"".
I have become so depressed that I've lately started binge drinking a lot and staying online on Planet Romeo for most part of the day.I flirt hopelessly with anyone over there in the hope of just moving on,but I'm just not able to.
Will this ever go away? :("</p>
