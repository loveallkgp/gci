<p>Hi.. Admins Love you guys for maintaining this page so well.. Kudos to you people..</p>
<p>This is a confessor from Kolkata....</p>
<p>I just want to share something... I never thought i would fall head over heels for someone.. But I did and I was so in love.. Bt there was only problem.. The love was all from my side, he never did love me... we used to chat everyday and all.. I was always there for him and helped him through rough times but he never did see me from that viewpoint... It was all a one sided affair... I cried a lot... Drunk texted him and what not... But in the end I came to terms with it.. I would never get him.. He will be the love that I will never get.. Maybe I didnt deserve it or i am bad looking or was not good enough for him, i dont know... (I know it is sounding very bollywood movie stuff... but this shit really happened to me)...
I also realised something that KARMA is a Bitch.. Actually wen I was in college I was in a relationship wid a girl and we didnt end things on good terms and now i feel like that for that reason maybe I didnt get this guy... God knows. I just hope that maybe sometime in the future i do end up with someone....</p>
