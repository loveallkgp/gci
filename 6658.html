<p>it took a great courage to express the feelings I'm going through.I'm 23 yr old.waiting for a girl since 2 yrs just bcz I can't love someone else dis much .like others I also get attracted towards beautiful girls .but some times it happens for men also .I  was in contact with few girls but .but it nvr reached to sexual relations...I dnt want any gay sex ..but I always feel the need of a man in my life with whom I can say the thing which I'm afraid to even share with my best friend n family .someone I can hug whn I'm low..n a lot things. parelley I need dat girl to complete my self ..I dnt knw it's homosexuality or hetero..I contacted few men on seeing their beautiful status regarding  life n relations n all but ironically they wre just sex seeker..I nvr cry in front of others no matter how much hard is time ..but I always miss dat person .I knw what i want is just imagination it can't happen ..but dis waiting n dis lonliless is killing me ..is dis gay word just attributed to sex ..</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, we applaud your courage. One thing that I'd like to tell you is that you can feel complete with either of the sex. Love makes you complete. Sometimes self love is more important than what you want from others.</h1>
<p>And the word gay isn't the synonym for sex. Sex is something that people. The only difference in gays seeking sex and straights seeking sex is that we are more open about it because it involves two guys. Don't let the social perceptions cloud your judgment.</p>
