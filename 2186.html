<p>i created this id out of boredom. since m nt good at making frnds over chats and nt into hooking up with random guys.......so i just check the images, videos, posts and confessions.........i access it only once or twice a week.....sometimes weeks fly away without logging in............only interesting thing i find here is this page..........i am a bisexual guy of 19. i find it really hard to live without love.......the kind of love which one expects from their loved ones.....i am in BLR fr 2 months with my friends i hav earlier told u guys about almost a month back........i dint like myself being creepy......i separated my way......i took a pg n strtd living by myself.................but i dnt like it.........i feel so sad having no1 in my life who could be my real friend.....sum1 whom i could call mine.......its just so sad out here................committing sumthng unpleasant is easy but i live for my family coz they cant afford to loose me...........m fed up with efffing boring life of mine.......no way to spice it up......m just a student now........that too shy one.......but being honest...my desperation for sex is getting stronger day by day........i just can't stop thinking about having sex with guys.........while i wanna be in a relationship with a girl coz i dnt imagine my future with a guy......but i feel more emotional towards males than females............dont knw what kinda hell my life is ......i wonder how these day will get over......there are hot guys in pg as well but i live alone so can't afford to invite a risk.........lets see what happens next........but m really sad about my loneliness.......</p>
<h1>GCI : i don't know if many people will agree here with me and they will even critisize me but i am going say this thing anyway .</h1>
<p>see if life is boring and you have despiration for sex .. why don't you have sex once . that's the spice . but again you have to try to find a stranger .. a good one .</p>
