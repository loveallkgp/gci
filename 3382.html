<p>"admin can you please give me a solution?</p>
<p>I'm 24 and there's  a 15 year old girl who lives in my neighbourhood, whenever i go for a walk, she follows me and then i go to some isolated park, then she comes and shout at me 'tuh gay hai' 'tuh gay hai!!!' 'mujhe sab pata chal gaya hai main pardafash kar doongi tera!!' and i don't know how come she got to know tht i'm gay? but once when i was in office, she came to my home and told my mom 'aunty kya mein apke bete ka computer use karsakti hoon' and my mom allowed her because she wanted to make some school project but she captured screenshots of my private browsing history and now she has all the proof. she threatens me everytime and says 'tum mardon ne jo aurton ko equal rights nahi diye hain na, ab iska badla mein leke rahoongi tum sab mardon se' then she kicks my ass and tells me to go away and i run away. and now she has sent me a message:</p>
<p>'aaj ki raat pardafash hokar rahega, main saboot ke saath haazir rahoongi
 taiyar rehna kaminey'</p>
<p>admin what should i do now?"</p>
<h1>gci- what a silly pathetic reason is that? Maybe you could just accept the inevitable? Or if she is willing get her to speak with you in a calm and quiet manner and explain him stuff. Say to her that its because of straight guy and not gay guys. We are also fighting for our rights. I mean if she can make that statement then she can be easily manipulated.</h1>
