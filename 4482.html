<p>why dont Siliguri( in the district of Darjeeling, WB) have gay friendly zone! till date i have seen only gays who meet just for a day to have sex !</p>
<p>i have been to Delhi, Mumbai and ahemdabad.. i found so many gay friends with whom i visited too many places but we didn't talk a single thing about sex.. we were like just another straight crazy friends... but in Siliguri... i met many people for casual meeting but those meeting turned or just about to turned into sex meeting! i mean why? is it community's environment so or people's mentality?</p>
<p>and just bcoz of i am 18 and i look cute( i know) people things i am bottom but i am not!
these things always roam in my mind.</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe the environment is not developed for them or there are not much people aware about LGBT stuff. It takes time to digest such facts. Even in my hometown of Amritsar the condition is like this. I tried making a change but people don't want to change. They want be hidden and don't want to meet anyone if it is not about sex. Clearly there is lot more required to be done.</h1>
