<p>hello guys, i am posting this here because i am searching my friend-
i am not gay but i am a gay rights supporter and this story is about my friend, when i was promoted to 10th grade, i made many friends and one of them was my best friend, he was used to sit with me and we shared our lunch and i really liked , few months after in my school rumors surfaced in my school (filled with homophobic students) that my friend is a gay and he was spotted with a guy kissing, many people came to me and told me about it but i thought they all must be kidding, some came to my home to confirm this rumor and they asked me whether i was that other guy with whom he was spotted, i couldn't understand what's happening, so next day i went to school and many students were making fun of us-
"oh see- there's a gay couple going", "hey gays , stop fucking in our school and get a room". i was horrified with such comments and so i asked my friend- "is it true?". he was silent and his silence clarified everything. i was in dilemma, i can't leave my best friend because of his sexual orientation but people will make fun of me, they will pass sexist comments and they will tell my parents unpredictable lies that i am a homosexual. i was homophobic too and i can't just bear all that verbal,cyber and physical bullying which i will receive in future. i was forced to leave my friend and i maintained safe distance from him. that day and today i still regret that i deserted my friend just for my convenience and reputation, i left him to become prey of homophobic bullies. i am in my 1st year of college and i miss him sometimes, i wish i can beg for forgiveness. </p>
<h1>Viv- Hope you get your friend back. :)</h1>
