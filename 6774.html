<p>Okey, this shit is getting ridiculous now day by day. I donno if this is some kind of conspiracy or what, but I'm in a real dilemma now. In 4 days, literally 3 more guys have said," I love you". I have been talking with them over a long time. And out of blue, they just proposed me. 
They are my good friends. I love talking nonsense things with them, though individually. I never thought of that they would say any such thing like this. I was happy being friends with them. 
Im very much confused these days. One proposal means one friend less. They dont talk in the way they used to talk. Im losing my friends. For some this might be the dream coming true, for me its not less than a nightmare. I don't have much friends over here. But those who are, I'm losing them. Either they stop talking or they disappear. And I'm the one left behind like a pet dog who once was adorable but now roaming around the streets seeking for a shelter. 
Guys, there's a thing I want to say to all of you. If you are friends with someone, just be friends. No lovyy dovvy thing should come in between your friendship. This thing ruins your friendship. </p>
