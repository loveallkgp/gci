<p>Its too long....but I want every reader to read this please...I wrote this letter on 30th August 2013
Its a letter which I wanted to send this to my LOVE but......
Hey Rishi
I am sorry to write this letter to you..I am writing you this is because I can feel that you never want to neet me after our break up ..even our msgs or calls reduced to almost 100%.so I decided to write this for you...I know I cant send this letter to you but I am sharing my feeling atleast to my diary "Mir"
I am sorry to say, it is really heart breaking for ne that you broke up with me. I don't know about you, but for me it is......
Indeed one of the most unacceptable facts that I don't want to realized it so soon...this is so soon already. You don't have to feel sorry for me, as I know you have no other better option to make. So, this is not your fault. I can understand. This is best for both of us now.
If you or someone happens to me, if I were to given a chance whether to choose you again, I won't have a seconds thought. The answer will or always will be a big "YES".Even we're only together for a short period. Within this period. I'm truly blessed! Within this period, I can taste heaven...
I can really feel the love that you have given me.
Its sincerely true and genuine. I thank you for that. No doubt the pain I get is indescribable. I believe Allah make us met for a reason.....
REMEMBER THE FIRST TWO DAYS WE MET?
Allah may also have the reason for our breakups. Allah may have a better plan ahead for you, me or us in the future.
I will definitely miss you now or in the future. I will miss the way you hug me first time in your car, the way you kiss me , the way you hold my hand, the way you stare at me in your car, the way you dance on music rhythm, the way you smile, the way you care for me and most importantly your presence. I'll keep it all in my heart safely and never will let it go. I wil always remember how you treat me. I'll forget the bad. I am really sorry for the things that I have done wrong and things that I am yet to do for...I am sorry "R"
And even though we couldn't last our relationship like what we want it to be, I will still wish you for the best. Wishing you all the best in finding your true love. I'll always be happy for you if you could find someone that you really want to live with and care for you more than I did. I am also sorry if I didn't provide much care, safety or security. I will always accept it with an open heart and wish both of you happiness always.
If I am invited to your marriage which you will do for the sake of your MAA and Daadi...I will attend no matter what! Because I want to be there to see you in wedding attire as it was my dream to see you in it...I know it will not be your happiest moment as you don't want to marry a girl...but I know it will be greatest, most happiest and most joyful moment of your Maa's Life...
As for now, within this period we apart from each other, we stay as best friends ok? And can we chat more often when you are free? Because I want to know more about you....and if you come back single and we happens to meet and still have feelings towards each other, then I think this is the best moment for us to start all over again! !!!
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING
we will have lots of dates before confirming.
alright? Sounds like a probation.
Haha....as for now we move on. You can still count on me in anything. You can also share anything to me, regardless, good or bad stuff. I'll be just right here. Just ring my cellphone or text...
Lastly
I wish you all the best and best of luck for getting success day by day....
Always be smart don't even think that you are in trouble ok
Hoping that your tensions won't strikes you again...and if it does, remember what I told you? YOU SHOULD REMEMBER
wishing you could get success without any kind of worries, with confident and with flying colours. The future really needs politicians like you who is reliable, capable and thoughtful. So next time IF I GOT A CHANCE when I meet you I'll greet you as Mr.R Politician!!!!
Who ever see how nice it is...haha
Sorry for the silly me. ..
I wil stop here last. Talk to you when we meet IF I HAVE CHANCE if not, 10 pages will not be enough to write for you....
As you know me I am very talkative.
See you soon, and please stay positive at all means and have positive thoughts. Remember to smile because A smile can leads to another smile. ... that is what I believe in.... and it works...
Till we meet again.... I will be a better man better than I am before and Today. ...
t.c. bye
Will always love you without any condition
Urs motu</p>
