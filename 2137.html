<p>please i need help.im in a huge conflict.m a bisexual.i have a gf .i love her and she loves me more.we both looking forward to get married.but sometimes i got this feeling of being a bottom and getting anal.i swear i swear to god i dont want it but the feeling is too strong.i lose control everytime.i keep on crosdresing ,inserting things up in my ass.i realy dont have words to explain this.but im sure i dont want it.and i realy love my gf.i just wana eliminate these things from my head.i know its natural but there must be a way.i dont care how painful it is.pleas anybody there who undrstands me and know any methode or any treatment.pleas dnt make fun of me.im having suicidal thoughts coz of it.i just wana get rid of it</p>
<h1>GCI : definitely your love this girl is strong . and i understand that when you are bi and when you feel like bottoming for another men is very strange feeling ,that too when you have a girl in life. but come on control your mind .. don't go for treatments ( treatment is for mental disorder or desease ..and you are having none ... its your physical need ) . to my best knowledge i advise you to buy a dildo or any other sex toy to please yourself when in need . keep your relation ... be faithful.</h1>
<p>and so many married str8 men nowdays in metro cities are having sex with their wifes where they play a bottom and there wife do them with 'dildo's as pert of playful sex .</p>
