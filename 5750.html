<p>Hi guys,
I was reading some old posts on this page earlier. One of them was some confessor wanted to get raped. Tbh, I felt sick to read that. People like this confessor fails to understand that the agony and shame that victims of rape feel. 
I was raped when I was 25 by a 20 year old college student. He spiked my drink and raped me. I wasn't able to tell anyone let alone to report it. I lived in shame and the guy who did it kept bullying me for years. Threatening me gave him some of kind of rush or the feeling to be powerful. I wasn't able to have any intimate relation with my bf for very long time. Most night I used to have nightmares knowing that he is out on the streets. I never felt safe. It felt like a part of me was taken from me. I have this constant shame that a 20 yr old out-powered me. I was angry for a large time and kept pushing everyone away. I kept blaming myself for all that happened to me.; as that guy who raped me said that I wanted him to rape me. 
After years of counselling I have managed to cope through it but I still do have night mares sometimes. I would never feel safe on my own. 
Please be concerned when you make comments about rape on a public platform like this page. To all the victims of rape, Please stay strong. It's not your fault. Be close to the people who care about you. Seek medical guidance and counselling. And please report the crime to the cops. Don't do the same mistake that I did. Talk to someone. </p>
<h1>GCI- WE r sorry ...literally sorry for u because we know how it feels.</h1>
<p>U know sweetpie that what is the worst part- As a male ur FIR wont be lodged under the rape section of 375, 376..Instead it will be filed under 377  which per se is not a valid law..it is a misleading section..
Furthermore according to the law a man cannot get RAPED, he can just be molested so as to say( bullshit).</p>
<p>And to talk in the context of BDSM ..there are people who are absolutely fine with sadomachism, and submission and slavery.
This creates a confusion for the people to differentiate between what is really wrong and what is 'may be right' in the cloak of GENERAL NOTION OF WRONG!</p>
<p>Ur words were inspiring..keep shining dear!</p>
