<p>Hi admins, I met a guy 3 weeks back who is nice. He looks good, funny and even gives me gifts when we meet. He has a good job and single too. We go for long drives and eat sweet kulchas. He says he likes me and wants relation. But I am suspicious. I offered sex many times but he says lets know each other first. He's 31 but still not married also. Do you think he has some sex disease or mental problems? Also we have almost 6 year age gap. Even if I agree to relation won't he become old faster and lose his good looks? I am scared so am ignoring him for last few days.</p>
<h1>GCI- Ohhh honey, he is being the same one here. He probably wants a long lasting relationship and according to me it is the best thing one can do to test the bond. If you can wait for a few months to get intimate, it will test the patience and your feelings for each other. He is like uber romantic. There could be other things too but I cannot tell. Most certainly not about sex diseases. What do you think I am a witch?</h1>
<p>Now about you, what are you with him for? Gifts, rides, dates? And please don't pretend that you are gonna grow younger with age and will split into an egg and a sperm at some time, 'cause honey, I will flush you either way.</p>
