<p>It's not so much a confession than it is a question.. Well I'm 20 and have been a victim to unrequited love.. I hadn't actually realised that people just liked me coz I'm cute.. They never actually took an understanding to the way I looked at the "relationship" .. My question is what is true love? I mean how would you define it.. Coz if it's what I think it is.. It doesn't seem to exist</p>
<p>PS- if you don't connect to me don't comment for the heck of it.. Thanks and cheers!</p>
<h1>GCI- Ugh, I understand it so well babe. For me true love is about making you see every bright color of life in a new way. One thing that can make you feel good about yourself and for the one whom you are with. True love is an experience which is just out of the world. It is for that person who can be your best friend, your rock, your partner, your support and your everything. True love is so deep that you can see Adele rolling in it while you feel her lyrics in you. You cannot imagine your life without your partner.</h1>
<p>I can go on and on.. but I should stop before I get too much emotional.</p>
