<h1>Viv- What is wrong with the lot of you? You first got friendly with him, you first flirted with him and you didn't tell him in the beginning that you are just talking as a friend. You should have made your stand clear in the first place that you are an attention seeker and when you have your fill with someone you move on to another person. Trust me, a person like him would have turned his back automatically and never have looked twice at you. Don't blame him, blame yourself honey. If you continue this, you are gonna get into a lot of trouble soon.</h1>
