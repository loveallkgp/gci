<p>My boyfriend is suffering from borderline personality disorder :(
He gets very moody and almost depressed. This day due to my takeover in fathers hedge fund office I'm unable to give him much time. Even his psychiatrist said that he should not be left alone. So I decided to move him in with me in my apartment. This all started shortly after his visit in home in Assam and when he told his parents about his sexual orientation they repulsed and abused him. He is a student from DU and only 20 years old and I'm 23 trying to make a mark in investment world. My parents knows about my orientation and hence when I told about him they did not hesitate. Right now I'm very scared what he might do in my absence. Once he tried to cut his vain. I rushed him to hospital. From then on I'm scared. His counsellor told me take him some place outside from all this. My parents planned a trip to France this December. Now will this help? I also advised him to emancipate from his parents since they made it cleared that they don't want him. Is it a right thing that I said to him? And why you parents cant accept your child even if he comes out as gay! I'm telling you this are the people that should be killed by terrorist not common man.
And btw we both are planning to this Sunday to pride march in Delhi. Hope to meet some great people :)</p>

<h1>GCI- Hats off to you darling that you are doing an awesome thing. You truly are a human and a piece of gem. From what I know, people with BPD have an intense fear of being left alone and hence are subjected to do self harm. Whenever you are away, call him or make him know understand that you will not leave him. His family abandoned him and that could have had a great affect upon him. Make him feel safe, make him feel loved and make him feel home with your family.</h1>
