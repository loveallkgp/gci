<p>people please help me out ! I may die out of sheer longing. admin, and others I humbly request to give me some detailed suggestions of what to do, take yout time to type. Its too long, but worth reading. Please !!!! your answer can help me making my life better. :( </p>
<p>I live in Europe, and for the first time I am falling for a gay guy ( i was stupid enough to fall for only straight guys ). I wanted a place to stay in Paris for 4 days and so I met him through couch surfing. I didn't expect anything, except if I get some "hot" time it would be an advantage. we met in a gay bar and chatted nicely, he was happy as I got some chocolates and a book for him. He was looking so beautiful in the dim light and said that to him as well. He smiled and said thank you. Thats my first time meeting a lot of gays ( apparently its a gay bar ) at one place ( i usually prefer one to one meeting. ) and i was bit nervous about the atmosphere. I saw few girly guys ( who are truly beautiful people, and smiling ). My negative mindset on them broke there ! after a while I went to his house and I gave him a nice massage ( which we already agreed to ) which he liked, and it ended with the "happy" ending, not just masturbation. I mean he is 32, very beautiful, long hair ( like the old kings ) and hairy and yes, I was actually starving for it and i was quite happy I got it after many months. They way he treated, woke me up by rubbing my hair, gave me breakfast ( it was my mom who gave me breakfast in th previous time 2 years ago ). and I really enjoyed my stay there. Didnt spend time with him outing as he was busy but just in his cute little house in morning and night.  Then in the 3rd day, i asked for "that" but he refused but instead put me on his chest and asked not to move. He was combing my hair, and I was waving my hands through his chest and it was quite filmy and romantic. I heard his heartbeat !!! All things happened right to me, which i was longing for years ! My god, it was like literal heaven ! I felt like he is the Prince. I might have given him 100s of kisses, ( he didnt give me much except for a few lip kisses which were hypnotic ).</p>
<p>I couldnt help stop crying while leaving ( i usually dont like the leaving part of beloved ones if I meet any ) and he saw the tears and hugged me saying "oh no!! " the type of hug which I have always wanted. and yes along with lot of kisses. Being in the proximity of a male who you truly like is heaven. I reached home then. This is my first time ever behaving with a gay guy so romantically and i feel I got the prince. He is not a breath taking figure but quite marvelous. Nevertheless, who cares about his beauty or age ( 8 years diff between us ) when there is kindness ? He apparently liked my massage and company but have not fell for me or connected emotionally. He is sensible, matured, a singer and a book seller. </p>
<p>See all relationships will be like this and there is nothing called "perfect couple". I dont want too much drama about this by hunting for "the perfect man" for years. I wanna get married ( publicly, thereby coming out ) and I should do useful things to the society ( being gay and no much responsibilities, i feel we should contribute more to the world than others, right ? ) 
5. Sensible gays ( people in general ) are very rare to find, and i think 4 days are enough to judge someone is sensible and kind ( of course people will show only their best part in 4 days but we are humans , everybody has stupid things, and negative qualities, what makes one "the perfect" is his love and general sensibility, kindness etc )</p>
<p>My questions are
1. Is this the way gays in the west usually be in their houses with gay guests ? i know i am over generalizing, but just give me some idea from your experience.
2. I expressed my interest on him, he said "lets see !" He also said he doesnt have rules for a relationship. He also said earlier that he prefer elder guys but not necessarily. Both know long distance is quite difficult ( 13 hrs travel, not a big deal I think )  but I cannot help falling in love. What can / should I do now ?
3. my mind is completely filled by his presence now, its difficult to concentrate on work. I am doped by his thoughts, hypnotized by his kindness please help.  ( I am about to cry while typing )is this a regular thing that all the first times will go through ? 
4. If loving someone is like a "need" will we stop showing it after some time, once the need / emotional deprivation is satiated ? see we dont eat our favorite food daily however tasty it is right ? there are days we dont even think about that food at all. will a relationship turnout like that ? i am seriously afraid about it.
5. adultery: my parents are divorced, one main reason is adultery committed by one of them. People do it because lack of love and boredom I think. another close uncle in family also divorced for a diff reason but I fear about boredom and adultery. my parents committed adultery not coz they are evil, but coz they are humans and they didn't have any affection between each other from earlier days ( daily fight ). Yes I am not my parents and i feel I am more patient and sensible than them but I fear what if the guy got bored with me and did this ?
6. For him race or colour or anything is not a problem it seems as he was in relationship with people from other cultures and he is interested in yoga, which I taught him. we have few things in common.
7 Will age / cultural diff be barrier to a relationship. I am 24, he is 32 and I am from typical south indian, traditional culture and he is a french classical singer. 
8. Seriously I want to marry him and go on with life. how to impress him and make him mine ? any suggestions and ideas ? how to proceed now ? its not an issue of traveling I can go again and meet him for the sole purpose of seeing him.</p>
<p>Please I am extremely dependent on you all to help me out, as I have NO ONE to speak this clearly and get an answer. please please, i beg all of you. </p>
<h1>GCI- Oh honey u need to cut short this beautiful story of urs and I will just say one thing.</h1>
<p>Grow more in all the aspects of ur life and U will never feel to ask about the nuances of love.
U must understand that love is worth living for only if we feel the same from the other side otherwise its a total wastage of our treasured emotion of the soul! </p>
<p>P.S- U should also try to know that age, class, race etc. are all numb when it comes to love but they they form the main drifting roles when not addressed properly.</p>
