<p>18 Delhi ( came last month only) 
I live in hostel in college campus and there is a park in front of my clg gate which in night turns into mainly gay park. Lots of sex seekers n hookers. I usually go there alone bt nvr did anything wid any1 ( I m still virgin) b4 dat night wen I saw a good looking 24 yr old guy dere sitting alone on the bench. I approached him and talked wid him nd den he asked for a walk nd we were just walking . I liked d way he said , "You know I m thinking u r gonna make d frst move "
I ws vry shy nd i just smiled nd told him i can't . This ws my frst time and den we kissed cuddled nd masturbated. finally we moved out of park bt i was cnstantly thinking abt whole day. I m sure he didnt evn care abt me. 
Then after 1 week , I saw him again nd again I said hi to him frst nd den he responded very warmly and we chatted fr an hour in park. He finally left as his one of frnds called him. Nothing happened dat day bt he left mark on my heart again. 
I asked him abt his orientation n he said it depends n he is also single bt i m too apprehensive to propose him nd i dont want to spoil our little frndship . If he says no den also i wudnt console myself. 
Also i promised myself if he is gonna show up again . I m nt going to talk him frst coz i dont want to look chepu. I just want him bt i also cant resist myself. He is so damn sexy n i m just avg looking guy. I also think it wont work out b\w us. I dont knw wat to do. 
God plz help me.
If ny1 has gud suggestion plz do comment.</p>
<h1>gci- Think what he does by coming in the park. What he did with you was just an action he might be doing everybody with others. Keep him in friendzone for now. Rest you can deal with later on your own.</h1>
