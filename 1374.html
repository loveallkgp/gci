<p>I am read that girl's confession really sad story.
I am lesbian and I know how my female friends react to break up , that totally sucks. even though i abuse them for dating such useless guy from inside my heart bleeds by watching them going through the feeling of betrayal .
my one lesbian friend is also dating one guy and i told her that is it not done, but hypocrites never understand wise words. after sometime that guy will also go through this pain of betrayal. hypocrisy is everywhere in all kind of relationships ,we cant do much about it. all we can do is to protect ourselves for not being victim. sadly our community is badly infected with this cancer and whenever one wise person raises a voice ,others makes sure that he doesnt get the success.
that is how situations like dowry,pedophilia, suicides,human rights violation occur. the whole world is fucked up guys. save your asses and always take a stand :)
(yes i give good speeches, not out yet will be soon!! despite many proposals by really good guys never dared to date any guy . about girls well lets not get into it hahaha) </p>
<h1>Viv- Precisely what every Queer person should learn. Queer people get into intersexuality relation and when they end up badly or somehow the identity is revealed, society says, "These people are like that only." Ultimately, loss is ours. Society makes opinions when they see negative things and negative things spread like fire. So its entirely upon us to change if we want to see the change in the society. Isn't it guys?</h1>
