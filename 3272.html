<p>"They say to calm or satisfy you bf you need to have sex or  sexually satisfy him also mentally. Mentally is ok, but for sex I don't believe that notion. My body is my temple and sometimes ur really becomes difficult for me to open up. My last 2 bf were very good but sometimes that forced me to do things which I never liked because I repulsed they dumped me, now I live in a state of insecurity that my current boyfriend will leave me because I'm to scare to open up. When I ask my friends they say sex is good and they just let there bf do the things but I never let anyone touch me and mentally and physically I'm unprepared. Admin tell me how to open up, how do I mentally and also physically prepare myself. My boyfriend is really good we are going out for 11 months but he never forced me occasionally we just kiss and cuddle almost everyday but never had sex. </p>

<h1>gci- See, you cannot open up until you get a partner. Only your partner can make you open. For that you need a partner who is patient and understands you and is ready to take the perks which comes with you.</h1>
<p>PS- sometimes porn helps a lot. Personally Lily and Marshall from "How I met your mother"actually opened me up.</p>
