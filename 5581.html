<p>I have read a lot of confessions made by Transgender guys as how miserable their life is. I would like to share a quick summary of my life with you guys. I experienced my father's death due to cancer when I was 10, it left us financially crippled. My mother got job on his behalf shortly, but she started suffering from severe depression. I was always made fun of in the class and was broken to the extent that I committed a failed suicide attempt. It was a fight for me at every step, but now I am working in a very reputed IT company, yes I am very proud of whatever I have achieved and even more proud of how I have achieved it. I am also a national level debator and one of the toppers of my Alma mater. I don't really believe in reincarnation and after life, for me death is an inevitable and permanent end, so we should not be very desperate for it. Whatever our life is, we should live it to the fullest. We should strive to make this world a better place to live in for the generations to come so that no Transgender boy is forced to take away his life at the age of 15 years in the future. </p>
<h1>GCi- That's the spirit! Good luck to you and best wishes to your mum!</h1>
