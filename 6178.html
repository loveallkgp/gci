<p>I am madly in love with my best friend. I knew from long that I am bisexual but this type of attraction is new to me. I keep constantly seeking his presence. I can't stop holding his hands when I am with him and I unwillingly get erected with his slightest touch. This has become a nightmare for me, as I don't want to advance and loose him at the end. Earlier I used to watch porn to masturbate, but now even porn doesn't excite me. Rather, I think about him and want. Please advice how do I control this urge and get out of this problem. I am planning to move to a different city, but I am unable to convince myself to stay apart and he is also not letting me move without any solid reason.
We are in late 20s and are independent men. We have known each other for 3 years. But I have started to feel all this just few months back. He is married.</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe now concentrate on gay people? I know feelings don't know when to pop up, they can come for anyone. Use your brain here. What good will it do to you? In the end, he is gonna be with his wife and kids and you will be just a friend who will never be satisfied. Moving away will not do you any good. You can be close to him and just accept that he is not the one for you. Maybe then you can move on.</h1>
