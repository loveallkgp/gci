<p>I want to share my story in the hope that young gay people realize how life is much better for them today than 30 yrs ago. I was born in the 70's. There was no internet and cellphones and tv had just 1or 2 channels. There was no gay porn or places where gays could meet except parks and toilets at night. In fact I didnt know even know the word gay, only that i was different. I didnt like sports and liked games like cooking and house. I was shy and uncomfortable around guys but was attracted to them. Needless to say my childhood and teen life was pure torture. Classmates used to ignore me or hit me all the time. Teachers used shout at me saying dont act like a girl. My mother also was very strict and used to blame me for acting girly and so getting beaten up. Once when i was school i touched the penis of a guy out of curiousity and he complained to his parents and they told my parents. My Dad belted me so much, the scars didnt heal for a month. My mother took me to a ayurvedic doc to cure me and he said i was short of hormones. He started some medicines which soon made me bleed while passing stools. But he said that happens and curing me is more important. Till 2 years i was weak anemic depressed and almost cried myself to sleep every night. I didnt have a single friend. My family hated me and i hated God for not making me like other guys. I then did what every person who is too weak to deal with life does. After reading in library, i bought a vial of a medicine which when injected in overdose causes death. I hid it under my bed to use it next morning when noone will be at home. I prayed to god that night that if my entire life is going to be like this then give me strength to end it. Next morning i was mentally prepared to die and checked under the bed but i found that a rat had chewed through the rubber cork of the bottle and the bottle was empty. I was upset and angry but couldnt find the courage and money to repeat it. I forgave all who tormented me including my parents and promised God i will stay alive just because he didnt want me dead. Suffering so much early in life made me very strong for whatever came my way in future. I worked hard stayed positive and I now am at a very senior position in a MNC and have great social life . I am single but do volunteer work, hang out with other gay friends and mostly keep myself happy and busy. My life is not perfect but i have learnt to stay strong in my low moments and enjoy every happy moment to the fullest. In fact i met one of the guys who used to bully me and he was jobless and asking me if i could help him find a job. My parents now also totally respect me. Guys please never ever give up. Just have faith that life WILL improve. You never know how and when life might surprise you. </p>
<h1>GCI- That is something really positive! Thanks for sharing it! :)</h1>
