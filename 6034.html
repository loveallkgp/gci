<p>TUSHAR PRASH here,
(last one I didn't wrote &amp; thnx for deleting it)
Yep, I cracked GRE with 332/340 &amp; it wasn't easy for my lazzy brain.
Guys, when I realised that I am GAY, i felt, I didn't belong here, I should quit.
I attempted sucide @ age of 16, I drank shampoo &amp; all I got was just loose motion :p
I created fake fb &amp; started chatting with random people. Some were of my type &amp; some total opposite. Felt happy, sad, dull. Was mixing with emotions.
Got some gems, but some assholes came along too.
Got judged by people, I too judged them for no reason. Lost everything, but got more than everything. Stood alone, felt like I am left; but that lonelyness is itself a huge amount of attractive matter. Use that lonelyness for good dids &amp; everyone will get attracted towords you. I wish every single person related to LGBT to get more than good fortune &amp; fresh air.
It's your life &amp; live it with full dedication.
stay healthy, blessed.
my bff V**A got 336/340, wish her too.
thanks to her for being always there :).</p>
