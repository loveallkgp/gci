<p>This is just getting out of hand now. Feeling quite guilty these days. I need to tell this. I cannot  hold it inside me any longer. Many of you would hate me after reading it. Well, I deserve that. But I need to share it. 
As I have posted earlier that im kinda commitment phobic guy. Hate to be in a relation. Friends should be friends and not lovers. There was this guy who loved me very much. Used to send me very sweet n nice messages, his daily chores pics and much more. But I was bearing him as he was not my type. Elder, in fact older and a bit girly. I told him to leave me. He tried to convince me but I was in my own world of pseudo attitude and told him to get over with this thing between us. There was another guy who was really caring for me. Used to send me gifts, take me out for movies and other stuff. But I didn't like him as well. I wanted to get over with him anyhow. And there are many more guys. 
Over the past few years I have been with more than a couple of dozen  guys simultaneously. I used to talk with them, do every thing from romance, outings, movies, sex...everything. I was addicted to it. Having 3-4 guys at a time, flirting and enjoying myself. That was me almost a bitch. Literally im a bitch. After a few  weeks of friendship or relationship (whatever you want to call) I was bored of them. Everyday same talks with every guy, fake feelings,,,literally made me bored. 
I donno what's wrong with me? After sex, im no longer interested in a guy. It seems like all the excitement has gone after sex. Gradually I stop talking to him and eventually no talks after sometime. And then again a new guy and the loop  continues. 
I have seen guys crying. But I didn't care much. Today I don't know why im feeling bad for them. And ashamed of myself. How could I do this? Sex and fun was a top priority over the feelings for me. Today, I m afraid of making new friends or entering into any relation. Because of this only. I have broken many hearts. 
That's all I had to say. </p>
