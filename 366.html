<p>Hey! I had this guy at my college who I found to be a complete villager. I kinda hated him as he was brash, rude, attention-seeking and what not. We had common friends. He used kiss every other guy on cheeks and neck(even lick and suckle) claiming that that's the way he meets his friends; no matter how much you protested. He is tough, you know. All disliked him but he was really helpful so people kinda used him. He used to come to see me too and i protested a bit as I despised his touch. Then he used to come to see me alone and I still used to protest to his touch. Looking at others I realized he gets more physical if you protest and the only way out is to remain indifferent to his touch. He was so attention seeking! So I started not giving any fucks and let him kiss and suckle my neck and cheeks. Then I also started treasuring his touch as it was a whole new experience. I stopped protesting at all. I was alone one day when he came and and when i held him tightly as he was kissing my neck he went all the way down to suck my nipples too. He then used to come around almost daily and we had a kinda good relationship. I looked beyond his villager habits and he used to claim me as his best friend. He told me he is straight and its all temporary. Unconventional and unorthrodox as I am I didn't have any problem with this Friend with benefits. lol. And I thought his barbarian habits wouldnt let me fall for him. He told me he liked this girl and that and I used to encourage him about it, as a good friend that I was. When I talked about us he told me we will go on as always. His would-be girlfriend doesn't need to know about whats going behind the four walls of a room and he will certainly be devoted and faithful to her mentally. With this statement I rest assured. Later he proved to be an extremely good friend, taking care of all my needs. He was like this with everybody but, somehow, I fell for him. I didn't realize. Last month he found a girl when he went out of station for a day and that whore of a girl got all tripped and committed in a days' time. LOL. He told me about her and that he has found someone finally. I told him about how I felt about him and that I dont expect anything except what we were into earlier. He is completely against it and staunchily denies saying any of what he promised. I was shattered. I tried to persuade him day in and day out, he didnt bow down. I broke friendship with him but i couldn't help talking to him for more than three days. I went to him again and we started talking.Just talking. Then one day when he was in my room I tried to get a bit physical with him and he pretended to protest and leave but didnt, he could have if he really wished he is brawny! Then he said if i do this and that I could have him for a day. I did what he told me but told him that its all because I like him anf not because I am some sex-deprived whore. I left. He came back and apologized and laid by my side and talked to me like the old times. and the next day he is back to his old distant self. He says he wants to stay as we were, doing all things together sans the physical part. I feel the best for me is to leave him completely cause I can not forget all that. And if we stay just friends just looking at him stinges me and makes me feel like I have been taken advantage of. I can't do this 'save our friendship' shit. But its hard to pass a day without talking to him. He is everywhere I am.And all i do is look at him reminicise! And I know his urge will rise and he would be back for a quickie but the ideas doesnt appeal to my conscience.</p>

<h1>Viv- Amazing! He knows how to use people and you know how to get used, thought it took some time from your side too. He treated you like a toy and then left you when he got a girl. Where is your swag? Hold on to it and if he gets back for a quickie, kick him the hell out. You are too sane to be friends with him.</h1>
