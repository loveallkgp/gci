<p>A guy liked/likes me. It's pretty apparent. I had no feelings for me initially whatsoever; just friends we were. Slowly due to his gestures of love n smile flashed toward me, and the way he'd look at me with admiration in his eyes...my heart started melting. I started falling for him. And fell I hard, with all my heart. I started feeling... is he the One? Daydreaming became a norm. We slowly became too close. I was happy.
One day he kissed a guy (Jokingly tho') I found it funny. It was a short peck. Everyone found it funny. Next day he said to me 'I'll be the first one to cum on ur face'
I dunno where the conversation started from but these words I remember pretty clear and rest have faded away.
I was speechless. I didn't know what to say. 'Never' escaped my lips. I stood and walked away. The 'insult' to my feelings for me were too much for my tender heart to bear.
I knew right then that my feelings for him will lead me nowhere except doom. I never showed my feelings to him again. Now all he sees is coldness in my eyes. He knows what he once claimed is never going to be fulfilled.
'Lemme know whenever u have. a gal!' I said to him once. 'Sure' he replied. He was smiling but sense of regret was quite clear in his eyes.
Love he never did me. Perhaps a bisexual guy he is. And he deserves no place in my heart. Because someone who measures my feelings with his lust is never going to be the One for me.
I still have feeling for him, maybe not as intense, and he never will know that I still have them. But m glad. Glad that his one sentence made me know where I truly stood in his life! Glad that I saved myself a major heartbreak. Glad that I still have my time to find the one...made for me..only me. And who will say 'I will be the first and last to hold your heart!'</p>
