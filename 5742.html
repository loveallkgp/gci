<h1>GCI- Creep alert! Threaten him by saying,"I know where your house is. If you don't leave me, I will tell everything to you mammiji." Punjabi boys are scared of their mammiji. Or just meet him and explain him that you don't feel like doing anything with him because you are not into him. It is as simple as that.</h1>
