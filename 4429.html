<p>I read a few confessions about bullies taunting guys due to their feminine character.Well,this is something I would like to confess here.
I was always meek,shy,girly and sweet and a lot of people took advantage of it.But I was good in studies,so it never really took a drastic form.
But in high school,when my handsome bestie left me anticipating my sexuality it strengthened me deep down.
After I joined college,the taunts werent there but the doubts prevailed and guys,mainly were reluctant to be friends with me anticipating my sexuality.As if I would bite or murder them.</p>
<p>I had female friends but I was depressed.Then came the turning point around 3 years back.I introspected and started to work on self improvement.I joined a few courses on public speaking,painting and jazz singing.Unconventional stuff but in those small group sessions there were mature men and women who never judged me and that sort of inculcated a certain degree of confidence.</p>
<p>Today,after three years I am more confident and popular than ever before.The very people who were reluctant in being friends hang around me all the time.Confidence,the ability to speak well and being talented(which was acquired mind you) helped.I still remember those guys,the scars are still there but life is far better.
So to all those who feel down today,I can only say do not try to protest against the bullies if you are weak.Instead make yourself strong and popular enough for every bully to respect you .Best of luck..Life is great,life will be great. </p>
