<p>This is more of a tell tale than a confession but i still need your advice.
My day couldn't get any worse. I am living in California USA for the past 8 years and been working here in restaurant. Just found out yesterday that my application for PR is declined. My hope of getting my life sorted became invincible dream. My bf in India thinks that I don't want him to be with me. But the reality is that if I can't build my future then how could I ask him leave his and be with me. It's selfish. And if he comes over and start living with me, but the q would be for how long? He has a very good job in India.
My parents are hell bent to get me married and I am very scared. They can force me to get married if I have to go back. They can't control my life here but back home they would do whatever it takes. Don't even want to think about it.
From the likes of it, my life might be going down the hell hole. I am not giving up but there's not much left for me to fight for. I don't know what to do.

<h1>GCI- PR rules in USA have always been difficult. Maybe you could have applied for skilled worker PR in Canada. That even you can get if you are in India. But even here the rules have changed. Just figure out our life and do not give in to the family pressure.</h1>
