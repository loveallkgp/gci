<h1>GCI- Great! He is fucking bully. You can get over him easily. Now your identity will be revealed. The best thing you could to his take the dirt and still hold your head high. You can be like, "Yeah I told you about my feelings because I thought you were a good person but seeing you like this only makes me go the hell away from you. Bloody stinking bully."</h1>
