<p>To all the beautiful souls out there i want to say something from my heart ....we all come here for so many revelations,confessions,incidents,stories...words of wonder and words of feelings....food for thought and befriend like minded people...but u know what what i find interesting is the fact that people here speak about SACRIFICES,FAMILY VALUES,AND THE BIGGEST SUCKIO-SHIT(LOG KYA KAHENGE..????) not to mention M APNE MAA BAAP ka dil nahi dukha sakta...o please bitch!!!!SPARE THE REVULSION....if u really want to know what family values are then OPEN ur mind and see HUMANITY..that is taught in the FAMILY first....and those CHANAKYAS who lecture about living as a fake person ....hold ur tounge DUNCES...!!! u ain't learned yet.....i know COMING OUT is not an issue until,and unless u make it one..and is dependent on various factors which allows us to live the way we want to still behind the closets...BUT that doesnt mean u should succumb away and try to fit in...just make sure u live life on ur own terms with a guy or without a guy..if u cant do that...go fuck ur dick with a pussy bitch!!! I even hear people hoping to take them away to some FAIRY GAY LAND..snap out of it Cindrellas...it wont be true for all...MAKE ur fairy land here...i read guys talking about M KITNA LAACHAR BEBAS HU!!!....guys if u cant help urself and be ur own light no one is gonna come hold ur hand and make u strong by its wand or potion!!!!! INDIAN families have 5 points to argue with us..1-HUMARA VANSH AAGE KESE BADEGA?? 2-IS IT GONNA BE NORMAL FOR US ALL THE TIME??? 3- Y DONT U JUST MARRY FOR OUR SAKE...OUR LAST WISH(BLA BLA) 4-CULTURE DOESN'T ALLOW..and ITS JUST GROSS EVEN TO THINK..HOW CAN U?? 5-LOGON KE TAANE HUM NAHI SUNEGE JUST BCOZ OF U!!! I mean seriously what lame things we face and succumb away...if u think u can ans these questions THEN shout ur ass out..otherwise go and learn more..and POST COMING OUT OR POST GAY LIBERATION STUFF..the things we shall be facing and being discriminated for are-1- GAYS!! O THOSE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS???.2-SO U R A TRANS MAN ..U GET FUCKED RYT??? 3-O MY GOD..HOLY CRAP IN THE NAME OF GOD..GAYS CAN MARRY???IS IT HAPPENING..WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS AND FAMILY?? 4-THEY SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED TO ADOPT!!!!!...5-ARE U KIDDING ME.??.THEY ARE EQUAL TO US FOR TAX AND MEDICAL BENEFITS??? YAA....OPEN SOCIETY..PLS GIVE ME A BREAK..THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN!!!! SEE THIS IS THE HEIGHTS OF INEQUALITY AND HYPOCRISY..now its upto u guys ...just dealing with TRIVIAL gay stuff is not gonna work..we must enlarge our socio-political sphere where the true lines of EQUALITY of our constitution shines one day..and who knows each one of us s who shall make HISTORY shall be thanked for what we did for our future generations.......</p>
