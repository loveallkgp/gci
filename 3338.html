<p>I liked a guy from my friend group in college. He used to catch my eye in class and smile and used to call me every week to play cricket with our group. He rarely talked about girls and used to hug me often. So i thought he was gay and fell in love. One day at his home while watching movie i tried to kiss him on lips. He pushed me suddenly and said kya kar raha hai bosdike. Tu gud hai kya? I apologised and tried to say i wasnt gay just joking. But he asked me to leave. And later i think he spread it in our group. Now they dont call me for cricket or dont sit with me in mess. They also pass comments sing vulgar songs or laugh when i pass. And the guy i tried to kiss also joins them in teasing me. I feel like dying.</p>
<h1>gci- Bullies. Effing hate them. Btw, don't pay much attention. And if they say anything again just say to your ex friend, "bitch, say for yourself because your dick is so small that even a screw driver looks thicker. You were never a well endowed fellow." And then calmly you can watch him burn in agony. 3:)</h1>
