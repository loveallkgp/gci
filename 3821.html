<p>Manoj  from bangalore
This is reply to comment on confession made by om who wanted to marry guy the comment said that his parents have every right to expect from him.
So to replier your ass must be real envied of all the shit that comes from your mouth.
Bitch his sister accepted him so did his cousin so why the fucking hell cant his parents. No one on this planet has right to force their choices on other he told them he was gay would be because he must have loved them enough to think that they might love him for the person he is and not for who he sleeps with<br>
om if u r reading this please reply u r n inspirtn 2 me and soon i will 2 come out to my family.
And i know ace is pet name of your bf bt can you please tell why ace?</p>
