<p>Hola.......
Guys wassup????
It realy feels sooooo great to see all of you people here together....
In my childhood o used to thonk om all alone bit seeing you all it realy feels like family though we dont know each other but we people still hold a bond...... And i hope it remains forever.... :D
I need some sugeestion......
I am bisexual... Kind of good looking..... The problem is like..... People here call me rude and mr. Attitude....... :'(
I dnt feel good at all coz im nt like that......
But they are like they wana have sex when i dont feel such thing for them they start giving me names.......
Dnt have i any right to choose whome i will date or have sex with they say its mean and rude to turn someone down.... But i i dnt want to have aomething with someone i dnt feel connected to or attracted to.......
Am i being rude admin????</p>
<h1>GCI- I have seen a version of this before where a guy denied sex to another guy, and the latter one openly ridiculed him. He openly called him names. You are not being rude. Just as they are being honest with what they want, you are being honest with what you want. Don't pay attention to such people.</h1>
