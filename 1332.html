<p>me and my friend and my friend's friend, three of us went on a school trip last year, my friend suggested that we should be room mates and i had no problem with that. everything was so nice on that school trip, that resort was beautiful and so was the beach. on the 2nd night of trip , as i entered my room to sleep, i opened that door and my friend was naked and madsaging his penis, i came and sat near to him, when he saw me, he was shocked but i told him to carry on. then my friend asked me to remove my clothes and i was naked too qnd he started touching my penis and then i started hugging me and he rolled over me and was kissing me passionately and then we stpped for few minutes and my friend's friend came, he too removed his clothes and we all were naked , we ensured that door is locked and windows are covered by curtains and we started our three-some sex. i was giving BJ to my friend and my friend's friend was having anal sex with my friend and we went to bathroom, we had sex and bathed together and continued our sex on bed whole night. next day when we went outside of resort , i secretly brought chocolate flavored condoms and we spent another night like this and rest of the nights with flavored condoms too. finally our trip came to end and we were again living in the comforts of our home and i just considered this as a nice sexual tour. on the first day of school after vaccation, my friend came to me and asked me that did i enjoy that trip? i said 'yeah, it was nice to have sex with you'. after that whenever there was no one at my home, i called my 2 friends and had sex and used flavoured condoms. one day i got bored of this sex life and i told him that i am no more intrested in having sex and my request was accepted. i know i am a gay but for some reason i no longer feel attracted to guys. i lost my sexual desires. my penis won't just errect and my mind won't think anything sexual. i don't know why this is happening to me, why i lost sexual desires? </p>
<h1>Viv- That is some psychological issue you are facing. You may go to a therapist for the solution of it or just try having sex with someone. Maybe that can get you back on track.</h1>
