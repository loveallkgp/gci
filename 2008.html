<p>Hello admin
There are many gays who sometimes need my help but sometimes when they come to me with high expectations to solve their problems or give them suggestions and if i am not able to do, this makes them dissapointed. So i decided to get your suggestions, there is bisexual guy who is in love with a girl and the girl loves him too, she cares for him a lot but the problem is that he can't propose her because he is bisexual, he doesn't want to tell her this, he wants to be in relationship with her but he can't and he can't lose her too . I am waiting for your reply.</p>
<h1>GCI- Simple... tell him to be with her and open up his cards slowly and slowly when she has complete trust on him and he can be loyal to her only. He really doesn't have to say right at the beginning. Getting to know each other fully is the first step and that cannot happen too early.</h1>
