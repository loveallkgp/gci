<p>I'm 20 and stay in a hostel. My confession is kinda nasty. Sometimes I sleep in my friend's room. He's dating someone, but it's complicated. Both on one big bed. Things started heating up lately in the middle of the night. I jerk him off and hes cool about it. But not a word we speak at that moment. 
Next day we pretend like it's all cool, like nothing happened and we never talk about it. There's always that awkwardness. But the guy says he's serious about his girl. Which is really confusing :S<br>
Is he just really straight or bi-curious? </p>
<h1>GCIL- He is hungry and sexually starved and you are providing him the food by playing with his meatus. Happy eating!</h1>
