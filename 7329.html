<p>This is not my first time in this page.I read regularly the posts here &amp; Admin you are doing great,although sometym you do drama which is good because laughter is good for health(as in my case i always laugh on your drama).well now let me come to the point.I am an  Archaeology masters student as well as a model(Aspire to be an actor in future).And ofcourse a gay(In our gay world people call straight acting gay which i find out really tacky Yet funny).Now my problem is i get lots of female attention in my normal life more than normal straight guys get. I enjoy the attention &amp; handle it very politely. But the problem is my friends.As m single,they always ask me why m single &amp; Not having gf even getting lots of attention.first i used to ignore their questions &amp; Give a simple reason lyk m not ready for a relationship.but nowadays m getting lot more question from them than usually i used to get.So m lil worry that may be they are suspecting at my sexuality..But m really not ready right now as my carrier is just began &amp; Yes m 100% sure that i will came out someday when the right time will came.But for now i really need a good suggestion (reason) to get away from their suspicious questions.And admin i m really hopping a very useful help from you.
P.S= I was in a relationship with a girl before,but she dumped me as she was suffering from Kidney disease. She replaced her one kidney with her mom.now she is fit &amp; fine &amp; Want to get back in relation with me,but m not..so should i covered by her to hide my sexuality.? (like beard)</p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmm....two questions and two suggestions from me.</h1>
<p>Q1- Why were u in a relation at the first place?? Did it really help?
Q2- What kind of help do u want now by being with anyone or want to stay away from questions only??</p>
<p>Suggestions-
1- U must see that ur grammar sucked and 'career' will suck too if u do not grow as a person from the inside.</p>
<p>2- U have not landed into any big trouble because u have handled it quite well and now u must develop new tactics to be mature enough to grow professionally as well as personally.</p>
<p>P.S- That girl loved u truly, but now has turned into a drag....M sorry she must know the truth or u must go away from her life for ever and dare not think to use her or charade urself...because selfishness always pays a heavy price and u my dear are acting nothing more than a selfish prick ryt now.
Remember the fact that if our selfishness is not harming anyone in the process then u r free to practise it as much as u want.</p>
