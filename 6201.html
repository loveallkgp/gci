<p>I'm having one of those straight guy crushes again. Or is he really straight. I have often seen him cracking gay jokes. Some gay guys do make fun of other gay guys to cover up their own sexuality. We were in hostel together. He was a year senior to me. He was nice to me at university but I never had this feeling for him. Me and my present boy friend met at omegle. We knew what both of us liked right from the beginning. But this is so different I don't know what to expect and I don't know what he might be expecting either. I am just assuming for now that he is a straight guy and really likes my company. But that night we talked for more than an hour on WhatsApp and I don't know how he felt about it and yes he was the one who started the conversation. But I was losing my heart... Yet again to another straight guy. Its so different when you don't know a person's orientation and u march right into this new special feeling without thinking much. Somebody help me out. I just want him to feel that I like him and not get totally creeped out. LM if u r reading this confession and you are here too... You know who you are and who I am.</p>
<p>Cute guy from North east India fall in for another cute guy from Northeast India.</p>
