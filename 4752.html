<p>Hi Friends,
I am about 32 years old now and still deep into the closet. Before I tell you my problem, I would like you to know few things about my past. I was raised in a traditional Punjabi family. I was exposed to sex at very early age when I wasn't even sure what it was. I was abused as a kid, was bullied at school. I was a geek and my classmates were nice to me only just before exams when they have to get notes or help them in cheating or that kind of stuff. Otherwise I was an easy prey to their pranks. All of this lowered my self esteem to such a low that by the time I hit the college I was really in bad shape. I wasn't able to concentrate on anything. I was good at faking so no one had a clue what's going on. I tried to take my life in my first year of graduation. But all that is past. Sorry all of this has brought so much negativity.
Now, I have accepted myself. I haven't been out yet. I feel jealous seeing my friends getting married and some have kids. Thinking of all this make me realize that I won't be able to experience all this. I want to have a Big Fat Punjabi wedding with all the rituals but I guess I have to give up on that. But why is that giving up this idea is so painful even if it is for a greater good. Getting married to girl is much worse than being single for the entire life. Honestly, I very little hope of meeting a guy who would want me for what I am and not anything else. I tried to search online, being to cruising spots, gay bars and gay coffee places. Everyone there seems to be hungry for sex. No one wants to talk about hobbies, art, interests etc but sexual preferences in bed. I cry a lot, not 'coz I am gay but for not being able to find a good guy. What should I do? One guy I recently met, said that I am total nut-job coz I want to know if he would be considering coming out?
Sorry, if my confession is too long and doesn't make any sense.
Hope someone among you would be able to help me.
Regards,
Jasspreet</p>
<h1>GCI- Don't blame yourself at all for this. Some gay guys can lick other guys so deep that they can reach their spleen but talking about romantic stuff will be kinda intimate and weird shit for them. You are clear about what you want. Atleast you are not pretending like others. There are those also who play love just to get sex. Don't feel bad about yourself at all. You are on your track, let others be on their track. You will get the one you want soon. God bless you.</h1>
