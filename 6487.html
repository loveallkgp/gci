<p>Hey guys. I am here to share my story which freaks me out whenever i recall my experience with this man. In june 2009, i had just completed my fourth semester of engineering and me with my friends had decided to visit srinagar. We had a month long plan for our vacation.we were 5 friends and all of us were gays which we had discovered in our late 1st year. They were all couples (Tipu and Rakesh)and (Aman and Sagar), and they were considering that trip as their honeymoon. I was the only one there without any partner.. We reached srinagar and Aman had already booked a hotel for us through his kashmiri contacts. We took two double bed room (for them)and a single bed room for me.. I felt excluded but what i cud do.? I didnt say anything and shifted. But out of anger refrained frm going to their room.  Later that evening, i felt hungry so i went to a restaurant in the hotel. I was waiting for my order when i saw him. His name was Razak and he was an attendant at the hotel. My eyes glued to him. He spotted me looking at him and came closer to me to ask if i need something. I say nothing keep staring at his mesmerising looks.. He said gud evening and went away. My eyes followed him till he disappeared. Next day we went to visit local sites but all i was thinking during the whole trip was to get bck to him. It was 3 that tym when we returned. I saw him cleaning something over the mat in my lobby. My friends pa$sed him ignoring as if no one was there. I felt disgusting for their attitude. I tipped him. He smiled and made my day.i went bck to my room. Next 5 days went as same, me going for sight seeing completely lost in razaks' thought and eager to get bck to see him. On the 7th day i decided that i ve found someone for and i wont let him go away. I faked sickness and let my friends go for trip to sonmarg and i stayed bck. Aftr they left, i went to restro to see razak. There was no one in the restro except razak.I still remember He was sitting at a corner table and looked puzzled with some sort of account calculation. I called my guts and sat opposite to him. He got suprised and stood up. I asked him to seat and inquired what he was doing. He told me that there is some sort of error in calculations bt he is nt able to rectify where. I askd if i cud help. He gave me a puzzld look and said ok. It was jst a matter of sec for me to find out the error and rectify it. He felt happy and suddely we became good friends. Aftr that i never went out wid my friends on any site seeing. I used to stay back helping razak. Talkin and occassionally hanging out. We became best buddies and my feelings for him became strongr than ever. I spent my entire month with him. And i felt that its d time i shud tell him abt me.. I took him to the terrace and told everythin. He didnt say anything. He just held my hand and smiled. I didnt knw what it meant bt i liked it.. Next day i sent whole day with him. By nw my friends had startd observing change in my behaviour and enquired me. Bt i never told them abt razak. It was 5 days to the end of my breaks. It was a fine evening. As usually i had spent whole day with razak and nw since my friends had arrived i was talking to them. It was 8 when i thought i must go and be with razak.. I went down dragged him to my room and shut the door. I hugged him and we started to talk and laugh and share. When suddenly i heard a loud scream.The sound appeared familiar to me as it was sagar who was shouting. It went out of my room and rushed to his. I saw Aman lying on the floor with his arm and leg twisted in a very scary manner.. Sagar was shouting hell out. He said Aman saw someone and as he shoutd bck to him, he suddenly fell and got twistd bck. I rushd bck to my room to call razak to help. Bt no one was there in my room. By the time i returned bck to aman. Aman was already put to bed by my remaining friends. For the whole nit, aman was mummering in his sleep. Once he also said razak. I was suprised. I never told them abt him. Even evr he opened his eyes.he used to ask who was standing behind us. It war really a scary nit. I never found razak ever aftr that nit as if he was never.. We went bck bt i still remember him. Was he real or some sort of ghost or my mind playd trick on me? I dnt knw bt all i knw is that this incident freaks Me out and believe me Its A Real Story.     </p>
<p>#GCI- OK I was waiting for some gay horror and ur story gave me the chills!</p>
