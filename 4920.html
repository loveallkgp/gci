<p>I have always had this doubt. If being bi is OK, one can marry a girl and still have feelings or whatever for a guy? because, I see a lot of people cursing them who have come out here and are in relationship with a girl, but, are you guys OK with bisexuals? I mean you can be on only one side. either be ok with bisexuals and be ok with guys here having a relation with a girl or just hate the total idea of it. So, which side are you on? Or, maybe I am missing a point here, if so shed some light.</p>
<h1>GCI- Of course you are missing out so much. You just sound like those heterosexuals who ask that if being gay is okay or not. You just have to like the opposite sex.</h1>
<p>I have said it many times here and now gonna write it again. Consider sexuality as a spectrum and two finite ends as homosexuality and heterosexuality. Some people lie on these finite ends. Rest lie in between. It's upon them to choose. You cannot force them to do what you want. Just as you don't want anyone else forcing you to have sex with girls if you are gay. Let people be for once.</p>
