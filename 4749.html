<p>Hmmm...let me start off like this...first of all I am a jerk...i wil let u decide that when u finish reading this confession. so I was dis depressed closeted guy...who thought that he could never feel being loved. I always thought a loving relationship with a guy would release my spirit that I had few years back...i was desperate for love...then I met this cute guy...not met f2f actually.. I opened a fake account and he ws d first guy I pinged...and wolla !! We clicked!! He was a chirpy cute little thing...one thing I liked most about him...what he does to me is..whenever he talks I smile a lot or go into fits of laughter...i proposed to him...and he said yes...and everything was smooth..and then when he really opened up..he turn out to be a really charismatic guy..artistic...i had no doubt he was a magnetic person..and suddenly my insecurities crept in...i started comparing him with me...and I felt so less in front of him..and I knew I had to get better...i wanted to better person for him...i said to him twice or,thrice...and he was comforting in every way...we chatted, for nearly a month and one fine night he suddenly said lets break up cus he thinks i cant stand up for him when the right time comes...this argument started since I had been going out of my room to talk to him..didnt wanted to get suspicions from my frens that I am in realtionship. He says its cowardice from my part...that nite I dont know why I said okay when he put the bomb...my insecurities and his adamant nature...lots to take in ...so I smiled ...heartbroken yes...and said have a good life to him...i asked him if we cud still be frens and he said he doesnt believe in that...hmm..fair enough...got to,respect that...i kept d,phone...so dats my confession...i am a jerk for thinking a relationship can make up whats broken...i am a jerk for not sticking up and fighting for d guy I was madly in love...i am still crazy about him...he will be special cus he is the first guy who loved me.. And said the three magical words...life goes on yes...but some special people leaves special prints... And my dear <strong>*</strong> you wil be always special. U were a good guy...u said u hated this song...but this Christmas night...m listening to 'someone like you' .....remembering you</p>
