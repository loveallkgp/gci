<p>WARNING!! WARNING!! WARNING!!
Again Some People Will Bark now for the another truth :</p>
<p>Here I'm back! I want to tell u all something Please if u born as man, Do act like man. Why do u all (maximum bottoms) always carry a girly nature with u? If u can't change this atleast try it, I'm sure, you will get success. And, if u don't wanna change it (through ur mind, soul) then pls don't say u r a man, neither a gay, rather u say urself CD, trans. The reason for why we (gays) don't get a positive respond frm our socitey, frnds because of this girly nature. And, we some (manly) gays/Bi's are ashamed to accept ourselves as gay just because of 'u' girlish gays. And u people are proud of being girly? But for how long? I'm sure no one gonna accept u as their life partner. (atleast from my side- a Big No). This is the most imp. reason for all the breakups. Because no one want to continue a relationship with a girly gay. Not only girly, they are above girl.</p>
<p>And one more suggestion for those who always searching sex in name of Love , pls stop blaming tops or bi people. U idiot people are so weak that u fall for a guy in a second. E.g </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Gym (arey wo tujhe dekha kyuki u look odd, that does nt mean he gonna loves u)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In College/Hostel/Coaching (arey isse pehle ye to jan le, wo larka me ya larki me interested hai, baad me tu hi to royega Dhokha dia bol ke)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Train/Bus (How stupid u r that u fall for a unknwn guy and planning inside, kb hoga mera inke sath ek raat ka gujara)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IN ONE SENTENCE U ARE THE BIGGEST LOST OF THE EARTH, GET A LIFE.</p>
<h1>GCI- Let me print your truth and wipe my butt in the toilet seat because that's where it belong. I thought it was something serious but you said it's the truth. A BIG LOL!</h1>
<p>You wrote that we gay people do not get respect because some are girly. No honey, we don't get respect because some of us has the patriarchal mindset which has rotted our brains. We people like to fit in. You forget that the gay liberation that is happening today, it all started with a bunch of queens, trans, drags, girly gays because at that time you patriarchal people were too much busy in pretending to be something that you are not. </p>
<p>You have a problem with something and someone? Change yourself because it's your fault, not theirs. The fault is in you. And please, with a mindset like yours, not even the manly guys would want a relation with you. </p>
<p>IN ONE SENTENCE, YOU ARE THE BIGGEST PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL OF THE EARTH. GET SOME EDUCATION.</p>
