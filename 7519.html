<p>Here my confession
Its not about love
Its about how to come out of that love
I posted my confession here before about my love with that guy
N i shared how we parted away</p>
<p>It was very difficult for me to live without him
But i knew it will take time to come out of him
But it was painfull
I started meeting others but was not fun
I was missing him was thinking about him
But then i meet some good ones as frnds
Talked to them
Got invovlved with social frnds 
Enjoyed with them hangouts
Diverted my mind
And i started feeling good
N dis process goes on today its not like tht i forget him
Bit it is not giving me pain
I m connected him through his family
We know each others family 
I talk to his family
But i m not talking to him
We sont hv anything bad for each others
But my love cant change into just drndship
So i stoped talking him
Now its not painfull now i m happy in my life</p>
<p>So all i want to say is time is biggest healer
Ur frnds ur family n ur efforts can make u out from anything</p>
<p>Stay blessed everyone
Spread love</p>
<h1>GCI- Good for you, mate. The most difficult part is to come out of it, and you have gotten it.</h1>
