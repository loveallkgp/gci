<p>This is my second post.</p>
<p>While writing or group discussion, so many things come to my mind that I end up feeling I sucked, but still, I will try</p>
<p>Was returning from a lil weekend tour, on Train, on my next row, a family was sitting, as I guessed, they were mon, dan, daughter n son. Middle class.
Then came one Trans lady, and was asking for money.
Yes, I kept my eyes closed, as if m sleeping, n she passed by my seat, didn't saying anything like 'kya chikne, 10 rs nikal' etc. , aftr reaching my wallet I didn't find much, n M unemployed presently. So I didn't give her any.
I looked at her, she was now walking towrads d front rows, with a smile on her face, wearing a sumple black worn off saree, n just a black plastic clip on hair, no claps, no slangs, no forced efiminate behaving, or cursing. She was not wearing nything woolen that would keep her warm, on her right hand was a row of folded10 rs. notes, like bus conductors. She was gping seat by seat, n was saying something quierly, with a gentle smile, leqning her fragile body a bit. whateva she said was not audible to me.</p>
<p>I heard giggles coming from somewhere, n found out, the family next to me, could see frm my seat, the mom n her daughter, a college student may be, were laughing together, pointing to the trans lady.</p>
<p>I dono wat they found funny?!
1. Was it the fact that the lady was not wearing any warm clothes or accessories unlike them?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Was it the fact that they had a reserved seat and she was begging from seat to seat?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it that they have a family, and she perhaps have sometimes heard her dad saying 'tere jaise beta honese toh naaulad hona behtar tha'?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it tha fact that they have debit card and that lady perhaps doesn't have a voter id card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or was it the joke that we all have heard 'kya ek hizra gents toilet me jayega, ya ladies toilet me!' ?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Degree certificate and money, Insaniyat wahin pe ake tham jati hey.</p>
<h1>GCI- It's really painful to see them begging for living. At one point they are called to give blessing to the new born and at the very next point they are not even considered humans. They don't have proper education, they don't have jobs and because of that they have to beg. And the people who don't think beyond the binary are the ones who really need some education. I always used to give them money because I used to think, "i can get hundred ruppees from my dad for a week easily. Atleast if I give her 10 ruppers from that to a hijra when I meet one and if many like me giver her money, she can have a meal for a day."</h1>
