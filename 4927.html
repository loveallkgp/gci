<p>I feeling quite hollow inside and seems like I am the superficial person myself that I till today saw in every other person. I am already 30 and my life is still hanging in the balance trying to find a purpose. I always had this weird fantasy of getting married and having a house and kids. But since I am gay, that fantasy is not going to be a reality, at least not in the way I pictured it. Half of my life is over and am still single. Don't know if I ever would be able to find my better half. I don't want to die alone. I guess that's the worst fear many of gay guys do have. Am I the only one who feels this way? I have friends family but they can't compensate for the void of a lover in my life. I wonder if my life is gonna be always like this, being a third wheel with friends. I am searching for happiness outside whereas happiness come from within. I wear a mask of being happy when I am around friends or family but in fact I am so sad. Sorry, I am being whining like a teenage girl. But I thought someone else might be in my shoes as well, so he can help me out.
And guys, please shove your sarcasms up you F<strong>*ing A</strong>. I am not in the the mood to entertain nonsense.
Peace
Amar</p>
