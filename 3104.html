<p>Hello everyone, I'm a 21 yr old and a regular reader of all the posts. I'm so proud of this page. It gives us such an open and free platform to share our innermost secrets and desires, which will be frowned upon on in our 'conservative' society . I have heaps of gratitude towards the admins who are doing a splendid job, they don't even get paid for it. I think one way of repaying them would be- telling as many friends as we can about this page- the relationship advice, health tips, dating help and especially the Gay Lord. Getting together all our like minded people, supporters, activists, parents of LGBT community, will definitely make a difference in our society.
I personally couldn't care less about section 377, but I would definitely like to see a huge mind set change towards our community. It starts with the gay bashing in schools and continues all through life. The stereotyping of gays in Indian cinema is just disgusting. The cheap acts that pass for comedy these days are revolting and say a lot about our filmmakers. I'm glad that at least, the lesbians are not depicted in such a poor light. When I see my straight friends laughing at these, I'm burning with anger inside. They enjoy watching lesbian porn, then behave as if such people don't exist. Any effort at opposing them, just turns back on me and I become the butt of their jokes. I just hope that one day they realize their mistakes and our next generation would be able to lead a happy and healthy life.
I'm sorry if my words hurt anyone, all my pent up rage and anger needed an outlet and I couldn't think of a better place to let them out. I'm in tears now, but my heart feels a lot lighter.</p>
