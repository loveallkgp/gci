<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Guys I saw something really disturbing on T.V some days ago and I was actually appalled to the core because someone had to die. No! It was no gay man or woman but a married straight woman this time at the hands of her in- laws &amp; her husband. Yes they murdered her just because she wanted to break free from the shackles of her one hell of a life. She was married to a GAY man and the story is from Rajasthan. When she found out that her husband was gay she wanted to leave him and their house because her life was devoid of her husband's care and love but instead her mother in law chose to get her raped by her younger son and when she didn't succumb to giving them a heir by this 'forced morality' &amp; she had to face her fate- DEATH. The story goes back to the mid nineties 94-95 I guess and after a year or two her body was found in a well with tied hands and brutally murdered.
I want to ask a simple question here- 
How many more Priya vedis or that techie's wife we would be creating just because of gay shame and homophobia and false male chauvinism??? How many more would have to die just to make sure that those 5% of our community who wants to live a dignified zero discrimination life can live just like any other individual??? How much 'blood' and 'time' we actually want to just live peacefully??? How much....please tell me how much????</p>
<h1>GCI- Same question from our side too!</h1>
