<p>Dear all</p>
<p>How are you all? I do not know whether you remember me your not. I had confessed here once regarding my story. Today's is not a confession. I just want to talk to you guys.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful world sweethearts. And you are being sent here to make this place even more beautiful. Who has sent you? Nobody has found an objective answer to this question; and I believe it is not so important to bothered about. We all have a limited period of time. And that period is very short. And for that reason, you don't have time to waste. There is so much to see, learn and feel in this sea of space. Believe me when I say that there are a lot of probabilities. You can even change the world. Do something new everyday. And whenever you have a confusion regarding something, do remember that it is better to regret doing it than to regret without doing it. You live life only once. Even if you do not gain anything by doing something, you will gain experience which is a treasure in itself. Experience everything but never become addicted to something. Experience will teach you to differentiate among good and bad. It will prevent you from committing mistakes. But don't be afraid to commit a mistake, because only those who do something commit mistakes. Learn to take responsibility. Learn to rectify, forgive. No one intentionally commits a mistake. There is always a story behind everything. Never be judgemental. For you don't know what's going on in someone's life. Treat everyone the way you like to get treated. Respect all. Love all. Love is the most sparse thing in this world; resource indeed. Life is too short to be shy darlings. Dance. Sing. Eat. Make merry. Cry. Always think good, positive. Don't care so much. It is okay if you didn't crack JEE Mains or your friend scored a booming 90% and you didn't. Everyone cannot be an intellectual. Recall your past but never stop moving on. There are good and bad days in life. But always keep smiling because who knows someone may fall in love with that smile of yours? :)</p>
<p>PS: Do let me know if you like talking to me. I shall share my mail id if required.</p>
