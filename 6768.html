<p>Yesterday someone posted shit about how hes happy that gavrav and nakshtra manly tops will be on TV. Let me tell you girly gays are the real people who represent gays. They suffer every day from birth till end because we can't hide our gayness. Manly gays and bisexuals hide among straights and get married to lead a double life. They don't face any ridicule and pain. We are teased insulted and used by straights as well as manly gay. We are the real representative of gay community. So stop this shit that you feel insulted by girly gays.</p>
<h1>GCI- I say it again, no one can represent gay community or any community for that matter. No one has done stuff to such an extent to represent our community except a few. Harrish Iyer, Anjali Gopalan(Founder of Naz Foundation who first took the initiative against Section 377 in 90s). Ashok Row Kavi, Pallav Patankar, Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi and countless others who have dedicated their time and energy over the decades to bring out the awareness among the masses, represent our colorful rainbow; not those who those who go in reality shows to get money on basis of some lies.</h1>
