<p>My parents are very religious and kind people. However they keep forcing me for marriage. I am the only son so cant escape marriage. So i thought i will let them watch satyamev jayete with me and slowly break it to them that i am gay if they are positive. However dad left it halfway cursing that these perverts are so desperate for sex that they want to change body and sleep with same kind. Soon they will make show that its ok to sleep with animals also. Mom was mostly silent but appeared bored. I asked her opinion after the show. She said its sad these people dont respect God just for sake of sex. I dont know how govt allowed such show..after hearing their comments i was really depressed. I dont think i will ever come out to them now.</p>
<h1>GCI- This is the mindset that we have to change that being gay doesn't mean that we just have sex. Sadly some people cannot even recognize the truth even when it dances naked infront of them. That's the case with your parents. They just don't to accept. Ab apna sar kaat ke to saabit karne nahi waale. But yo don't loose hope. YOu can make your future somewhere. Get financially settled, have a nice partner and then tell your parents. If they accept then okay, if not then say, "i wish you could see how happy i am by being me and not being a robot."</h1>
