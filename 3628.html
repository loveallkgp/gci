<p>This is my second confession here.<br>
I m in some sort of coming out spree.  I came out to my 3 close friends within a month.  Day before yesterday I came out to my bestie. I didn't wanna tell him at first cozz he was someone who was pretty critical about gays when v were in first years.  he even went to the extent of saying that gays are not supposed to exist and they must not b allowed to exist. There was a guy in my class whom v found out was bi. My friend used to be afraid of him   .  Haa..when dat guy used to come into his room I enjoyed seeing his expressions change..  seeing him becoming afraid bcoz of his own prejudices was fun. But slowly things changed ....i began talking about everything. When in groups I used to shift topics from politics to gay rights and about transgender rights just to get to know the people who are supportive  and about the ones who have deep seated prejudices. Well these discussions and awareness could have changed the attitude of my friend.     Now I happen to be my fourth year.  And when I came out he was totally shocked ...and started blabbering. . I said cool down v can talk about it tomorrow. He took few long breaths and then smiled a bit. His first question was if anyone else knew..when he got yes for an answer he was pissed off and said"see I m always the last one to know" sadly. Then I asked him " with the ideologies you used to bear  in your mind..do u really think I would feel OK about telling this to you first   " v both laughed. He looked at me and said "i think you already know that this changes nothing between us. I will always love you no matter what." I replied" I love you too". I was disappointed by his reply/reaction..  I wanted him to freak out and run away from my room...i didn't know ..that he has grown up quiet a bit.</p>
