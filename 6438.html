<p>Amm.......
One of friends asked me a particular kind of help.
That was the help which I neither really support nor really like, nor appreciate too much, try to avoid myself from it and don't even accept!
I declined it. He did not say anything but found it very selfish from my side.
I know that had I said YES, it would have made me furious later for being unable to say NO.
But now that I declined the help, I am feeling so guilty as well.
Though he did not say anything to me, the way he said: OKK, THIIK HAI, is still making me feel so guilty!
I dont know how will I make my eye contact with him next time! How will I avoid the awkwardness!
Feeling heavy!</p>
<h1>GCI- Umm question... what kind of help did your friend ask?</h1>
