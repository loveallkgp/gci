<p>Hii admin and GCI members!
So, much before I put my feelings here, I know that admin you will like to give some sarcastic comment but I would like you to please be sensitive about it as I also used to think how can someone be so immature to think in this way but when your emotions and situations make u feel in a particular way, it's when you realize that preaching is much easier than facing a tricky situation.</p>
<p>The problem is short and simple. I had a good friend. A very good friend, infact. We started talking months ago but slowly slowly we became very close, very true and honest friends. We were part of each other's lives bcoz we cud share our those personal feelings with each other which we couldn't from rest of the world. We would help each other in finding solutions of their problems.</p>
<p>But somewhere i felt that i trouble him, that the person has a hard time in accepting me in my truest form, that he after a point gets irritated from me. So, i reduced my talks with him. And whenever i did so, he wud say that i don't talk. Then i wud resume our talks only to feel bad to find out that he was really pissed of my behaviour.</p>
<p>THIS cycle wud go on and on. So, i decided one day (which i know shud not happen in a healthy friendship) that now I will talk to him only on things he wants to talk to and only when he is ready for talks.</p>
<p>So, he replied after few days that he is missing me and said something in jest which hurt me very deeply. Almost made me feel guilty of something.</p>
<p>So, i stopped starting talks from my side and would reply in formal ways only. Slowly the talks ended and it's almost 1.5 months that we haven't talked properly.</p>
<p>I miss our friendship. In school days, I couldn't ever come in good terms with a girl of my class just because a silly, stupid reason. And i regretted it after my school life.</p>
<p>Since then, I don't like losing my close and true friends due to the silly stupidity of human nature. It hurts when two true people get apart bcoz of some misunderstandings. :(</p>
<p>In our case, the misunderstandings couldn't got cleared as I feel shy to express each and every emotion and express most of the things INDIRECTLY!</p>
<p>I can't sleep. That I lost a friend for mno reason makes me sad. I'm bunking classes tomorrow.</p>
<p>P.s. : I feel like Konkana Sen Sharma from Wake up Sid' climax when she writes down her emotions in the magazine's article coz she's too weak to express them directly to Ranbir Kapoor. :p :p</p>
<p>P. P. S. : I don't edit/ proof read my confessions.</p>
<p>May God tell me how to behave my age.</p>
<h1>GCI- Hey! I am not an asshole always. But wait...maybe I am.</h1>
<p>Who cares, though.</p>
<p>I really can't comment on this as I don't know your nature and his nature. So I guess I am helpless in this scenario.</p>
