<p>hi guys !
Accidently i met a guy here... he msged me first and v started chatting... out of curiosity i asked him his pic. He immediately sent it to me. And guess wat, he looked super cool and sexy. I thought it wasnt his pic at first. Wen it was my turn i sent him my original pic. (i dont look dat great, but i do look good ) But then probably he liked me or my pic or the way i was chatting with him or all three together , he wanted to xchange phone numbers. I did giv him mine. We startd speakng over phone. Within a week of us meeting here, v had spoken fr about 4 times, each call lasting for an hour. Finally, again , Fluke or luck or fate as anyone might call it, both of us were free the nxt day and i had place at my home. So he did come. As i stated, m a virgin nd i wanted to be a bottom. To my shock he was the same guy as in the pic and was even more tall, fair and hot. We started making love. The first time wen he penetrated ( ) i had hell lotta pain. You guys know what he did ? he took his dick out, kept his palm on my forehead, kissed me and said he wud not do it agn. SURRPRISING RIGHT ? Anyone at his position wud only proceed but he showered care n lov. I was dumbstruck. I had to then convince him to fuck me and then he did, slowly and ya i loved. I really feel glad that i lost my virginity to a guy like him. I really like him. We are still in touch. He s a doctor( age 31) and m an engineering student ( age 20) , but wenevr we talk i have never felt any age difference. As of now we do not speak much bcoz both of us are busy .
i know its quite long, anyways thanx for reading it. I had posted it only for admin bcoz i always c him ask for true confessions.
And as far as m concerned i decided that i will not hav sex with anyone else except him. I know v wont find time hereafter coz both of us are busy. Still m not ready to take in anyone else's dick except for his .
And for all u critics out there, neither this is a story nor its love. Even if u call it one, i dont care as aleast i had the guts n thought of sharing it to u all. There is a deep friendship , care and affection for each other. Watever happens, i'll remember him all through my life as a friend, a close friend who cud understand me.
His name is Anand. If u come across this, u will understand who i am.
This is for u Anand. Love u</p>
