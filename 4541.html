<p>Hi! I am the confessor of confession #4529.
The thing is we have not done that stuff for one or two times, it has happened for many times. Once he told me that friends dont behave like this, so i understood him and i took my step back. But again after that the same thing happened.
He is not ready to admit it or accept it! Sometimes i say him i love u so he says i dont wnt such frnd who loves me! But he hugs me in night and all.. what should i consider then? I dont want to lose him. Nor i can behave badly wid him. I love him but he does not.. so why he did this wid me. And now avoids me? I am shattered by this behaviour of his. Once he used to say we will b together forever, but nw he contradicts to his words. Jab akele rehte hai tab bht ache se behave karta hai, but bakiyo k samne mujhse dhang se baat bhi nahi karta.. kya mujhse galti ho gayi kuch? Kiss usne kiya tha pehle! I didnt provoked him, then why i am suffering! And he has no effect of what he did!! What should i do? </p>
<h1>GCI- Leave him on his own. Don't interfere much in his feelings and emotional space. He is clearly in denial and his regular internal struggle is getting him away from you. If you don't pay much attention to him, he will think about it, he will become restless and maybe then he will have the courage to think about accepting himself. It's called reverse psychology. But do not accept much and don't do anything with him again.</h1>
