<p>I'm a 20 y/o old Transsexual guy (girl from within). I told my parents about it thinking they'll support me. Instead, my dad scolded me and the next day my mom told me that he'll get me injected so that the Testosterone Production increases and Oestrogen Production diminishes. But I don't want that. I feel that if once I become a guy, my life will end there. But if I become a girl, that'll be where my life begins. And I'm afraid to go against my father as he scares the hell out of me and also beats me. And I feel like killing myself right now.</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, if you don't feel comfortable with your present gender, there is no harm in changing to what you feel from inside. It will be for your own happiness and your own personal freedom. I don't how your life will be different in any sense as it will be now. If you don't change yourself, you will remain with a guy for the rest of your life, lost in the chains that forbid you to reach your reality, and then you will die. Then no one will remember you at all. One less tormented soul. Work for the betterment of your life.</h1>
