<p>m a transgender, havent told my boyfriend yet.he never felt of me being a trans. actually if i would have been a girl i would surelly be a tomboy. whatever be the behaviour at the end of day i knew dt m a girl. i want to marry a guy wearing a manish malhora lengha. not a tuxido. wear chura and mehindi on my wearing. i want a guy to love me as a girl not as a guy, i fell trapped in a male body.i want to spend rest of life being a women i have even thought of surgery bt the problem is m in a relationship with a guy for almost 2 years. we really love each other. bt i havent told him dt m a transgender and he never got a vibe too.. he jst thinks that m a gay guy. He is the perfert man i wished for bt m scared to losse him as he never want his bf to be trans or girly. he doesnt even knw that i crossdress. indeed it ll be a complete shock, if i confess him all this. We rr perfect couples. we have even thought of marring each other. he thinks there is no secrets between us. bt i know there is big volcano of secrets which i have kept within myself. i dont want to betray him. bt m scared to losse him. i dont know how he would react. m really scared.. plzz help me.. what should i do. m really confused.. </p>
<h1>GCI- About his reaction you'd know better as you know him in a much better way. Two years is a long time and you really should know if you should trust him with your secrets. Moreover, a secret like this should be revealed at the earliest stage possible in a relationship. I'd say, go and tell him. If he truly loves you, he will stay with you.</h1>
