<p>Im very new to this relationship thing. Although I've been in relationships this is different. I had sex with all of them and also had extra relationships with other boys but I don't know why Im not convince to have sex with him. He is super cute and also virgin; the other day he asked that we should have sex but i was scared because i know if we have sex our relationship will break and i wont be able to love him as i do now. 
Should i have sex with him? I love him very much but i just don't want to take that sweet innocence from him! Should i tell him what will be our consequences if we have sex? 
Help me</p>

<p>$ ABBY $  :  ( LOVE without SEX is just as hollow as SEX without LOVE) </p>
<p>if you think you will loose interest in him after having sex... you aren't really in love.  that guy isn't an object . alter and update your reasoning. make an ardent and very spiritual relation with him . 
there are a fair amount of things you can do to make this relationship work . 
also tell the same thing to him about 'loosing interest 'after sex. your relationship shall first reach the emotional level ... so you two shall wait for sex. sex can happen later but first fall in love... find compatibility with each other. its not important to have sex in the starting of relationship .... 'sex' is part which comes later 'love' when you know you have found a person to spend rest of you life with ,on whom you trust with your body with you secrets.</p>
