<p>Well, there is a guy in my class, i know him since i was in 11th, we were rivals... But what happened is, in 1st year of graduation, I started to talk to him, and i just don't know how i started to like him, and i became so mad about him that, i could do everything for him, i still can do, but the thing is, he is straight, and in 2nd year, he got a girl, whenever he's with her, he behaves weirdly, and now, he's so much into her.... I did everything for him, but he didn't care about me... I'm not possessive or something, but it hurts so badly, i just don't know how many fake ids i have made just to get closer to him, just a little "Hi" with him makes my day, but now, we don't talk coz he did bitching about me.... I'm not angry on him, i can still forgive him, he's my weakness, any suggestions on to how forget him?? </p>
<h1>Viv- Stop thinking about him. If he doesn't give a fuck to you then you shouldn't give a fuck to him. Neki kar dariya mein daal wale logo ko kabhi dekhna bhi nai chahiye. So kick his butt away from your life and don't let yourself gloom in the dark.</h1>
