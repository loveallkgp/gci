<p>"Love is a cheap word. Anyone can say it, but only few know what it means." 
- Julianna Scott
Love is not just about going on dates, having sex, showing off to the world rather its all about being with the person who makes you happy in a way that nobody else can.....
We people think love is few chats and then the infatuation, few dates, just being in arms of a person, talking cute romantic things, having fun together, just saying I love u... But reality is abit different and definitely love is hard....
Then what really true love means?? 
True love is about caring for someone you love, being with him when he needs your help, understanding the thoughts and feelings during hard times or otherwise, patiently listening to the person, doing everything to protect and look after him, letting the person be their self, loving unconditionally, being faithful and loyal. Most Importantly:
If you want to be in love you need be patient but to be patient you need to trust him and his feelings.
Lastly, Every meaning of love what I mean might not be same for you so live it and experience it, whether it is good or bad, it is never same for everyone and always have different meanings... Just never let love affect you because love has collapsed great walls..... :)

Keep loving and keep smiling....... &lt;3 &lt;3 :)
