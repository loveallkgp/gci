<p>Hello! :)
Everyday I see people posting that they are looking for true love, they can leave everything for their love. I always think how they can even think of leaving their parents who brought up them with so much of love and care. Today if they are able to make any such decision against their parents, it is just because their parents gave them such an education and life. How the purest love of 20+ years losses its existence in front of the love of a few months. Its just your selfishness that you are ready to leave your mom-dad at the time when they are heading towards their old age, the time when they need you the most. I know its India. Parents won't understand that we have right to love the person I want. Still, at no cost the decision of leaving your mom dad for your love is worthy.
Take a break from work, read it thrice and try to think what you are going to gift to your parents. Your parents lived their whole life for you and now when its your turn to take care of them, you are taking such decisions against them. They always did everything that could bring smile on your face and see what you are going to do.</p>
<p>Grow up guys! No one can take place of your parents. No one can love you the way they do! </p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmmm....ok but-</h1>
<p>1- What will you say about those parents who are ready to kill their children when they find out they are lgbt?!
2- What is your stance on parents dying one day ultimately and leaving us with a fake relationship with some guy/girl where it eats our soul and propagates hypocrisy?!
3- How will you account for the mental health problems multiplied by being in the closet for many?!
4- What would you opine for those parents who treats their children like dream fulfilling machines?!
5- What would be your stance when it is ''taken for granted'' that
parents need not understand our situation and reality?!
6- Why is everything voted on their side inspite of knowing that they are giving birth to humans and not some Matrix born robo-sapiens?!
7- Can you answer the basic question of our parents psyche being flexible enough to understand our plight someday and be on our side...maybe after some years?!
8- If our parents do not choose our gender, sexuality, body features and characteristics then how can they have the so called divine rights over us...pray tell me about it love...I am eager to know...Would u?!
9- How will you account for the Log kya kahenge mentality of the Indian people?
10- How will you justify by ruining future generation by laying compromising examples of the past?!</p>
<p>P.S- No one is forcing here to leave their parents or be in love with someone..If someone can deal both the sides..well and good...if not..... then they must keep ur opinion of lovers/parents issue in their asses. PERIOD!</p>
