<p>You guys must've watched Kapoor and Sons, right? I'm the Fawad Khan. I mean I'm literally very very much alike. At the same time, I guess there are so many gay guys out there who are just very similar to that character. Somewhere we gays have this thing - say societal oppression or desire of perfection or something else - that shapes most of us into that model of 'perfect bachha'. And the truth is, it frustrates me out. Not because I hate being like this but I hate the fact that somewhere, sometime in future I'll be the one who'll let them down. I know you'll say to make them 'understand' and they should love me for who I am. Woh sab baatein sahi hain apni jagah. But let's be real, in this age, parents will be disappointed if their son comes out as homosexual. Exceptions are everywhere but on general level, its still the good old society we live in. 
I know for a fact that I shall never marry. This, however, will ultimately lead my parents to question and speculate things. And that's when they'll know their perfect baby can cause them disappointment too. This is the point in my life I'm scared about. I don't give a single shit to what people call me or say me - I have a personality strong enough to endure any brutality the society has to throw at me and never will I ever bow my head towards the bigoted traditions  - but when my parents are in question, I go weak in my knees. The look of disappointment in their eyes that I can only imagine right now will haunt me every single day if I see it in reality. But hard reality is they eventually have to go through it. I eventually have to go through it. 
Somewhere this fear has lead me to try to change myself. I feel like if I'm gonna hurt them later at once then why not start being imperfect from now. This thought hit me when I was sixteen. Ever since I feel like I should do something that gets me outta the league of 'perfect'! But I've failed miserably. I'm again just pretending to be someone I'm not. And when I watched that movie the fear came straight back. Argghhh. I'm not being able to put my thoughts into words properly. Anyways lemme cut it here. Thanks for reading by. Feels nice confessing stuff :) Stay blessed guys!</p>
<h1>GCIL- Well, then do what Rahul(fawad khan) did after he came out unwantedly...live ur life without apologies and regrets of u being gay.</h1>
<p>P.S- If your parents chose ur gender, sexuality, personality, IQ nd ur fucking size of the dick and the brain, u can choose to remain the 'perfect bachha' and can come here to cry, but I won't console u every tym.</p>
