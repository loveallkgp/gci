<p>I am a gay man of 20. My best friend who knows about me and who till now I thought was straight, confessed that he wants me to fuck his ass. He has no interest in men particularly but only wants me to fuck him badly. He says he has fantasized about it for a very long time now. I however think of him like a brother. I never thought of him that way ever. Now that he openly asks me to bang his ass, its really awkward for me. I cant grasp my mind around this fact. it would be like fucking my brother. I love him alot (for naive people: friend's love of course) and want him happy. He's literally asking me to have sex with him so badly. Turning him down everytime feels so bad and gulityful. I told him to have someone else fuck him but he only wants me to do it as he feels nothing for other men. What do I do? How the hell do I handle this shit? We had such a great realtionship and now everything is messed up. I don't wanna fuck him but me fucking him will only make him happy. Am I going to lose my bond with him? What if our friendship is hampered? God, I dont know what to do :( Should I just fuck him even if I don't want to? That would be too gross but. I ann only have sex woth someone Im romantically interested into. Should I start making distance with my best of all friends? Oh, why did it have to happen?</p>
<h1>GCI- Well if you want to save your friendship, then turn it down. That will be good. Or just tell him about grindr. Those people can calm his thirsty ass down.</h1>
