<p>I'm a regular reader of this page. My mornings are incomplete without reading the confessions and especially the admin's replies. Not really a confession, Just my thoughts...</p>
<p>As I found this page a few months ago, it came as a big surprise to me that so many guys were in a serious relationship, I had the opinion that people couldn't be in a relationship due to our narrow minded society. At the most- a "friends with benefits" kind of relationship was all I could imagine. I became a lot more positive about my life and am also on the lookout for my partner now- all thanks to the confessions posted here. If somebody could market or make this page famous- I think the Govt. officials would sit up and take notice of our needs and scrap 377.
It pains me a lot to see the number of relationships that break up in our community. Agreed, heterosexual relationships break up too, but I feel it's completely different there. The main reasons are - difference of opinions or infidelity. Whereas here, a lot of the relationships break up because one or both partners are not open about their sexuality. They get into a relationship with all good intentions, but ultimately family pressure, society pressure take over and they have no second thoughts about dumping their partner.
My sincere advice to all the guys getting into a relationship would be- to consider all the factors before sharing your life with someone else. Think of the society, family, everyone. It's easy to say- Fuck society!! But practically speaking, we've got to live in the same society. If you think you won't be able to please the society- don't get into a relationship. Just stay single. It's better for everyone.
On the other hand, if you've decided to go ahead with a relationship, devote yourself completely. Be open about your sexuality to your parents and don't try to hide it from the world. It may seem a bit harsh, but I feel it's the only way in which we can prevent relationships from breaking up.
As for me- I'm the only son for my parents, so as you can imagine, I'm supposed to carry on the family "legacy" and such. I want to get a partner and as soon as the relationship gets serious, I want him to take me to his parents and I would bring him to mine. All my fairytale dreams! Hoping for the best.
PS- Dear admin, you're doing a commendable job. True, I too felt your replies to confessions had shortened in the last few weeks. I know you've been occupied with your duties. Don't worry, the 7400 odd (No. of likes) people who've seen your previous replies will be able to give fitting replies to the confessions( I'm not sure if we can match up to your sarcasm lol). The baby whom you gave birth to, is now in our safe hands. The very thought you had of starting the page, giving us a platform to express ourselves, makes you a Saint in my eyes. I'm sure like many others, I'm proud to say this page made a difference to my life.
Love all of you out there. Keep confessing!!! :-)</p>
<h1>GCI- Awww thanks sweetie. That's the main motive of our page to make people feel positive, confident and good about themselves. Keep up rocking everyone. Just know that you don't have to hide your true fabulous nature for anyone. No matter what you are, you are amazing in your own way and no one has got the right to decide for you how to live except you. Keep that charm on, babies.</h1>
