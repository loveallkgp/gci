<p>Hey guys
Have begun following this page recently. I seek suggestions from sane, sorted and mature people.</p>
<p>I have identified myself being gay for over 10 years now. I'm 25 presently and have had quite a few sexual encounters. I have had 3 steady boyfriends till date. Somewhere last august I figured that it wasn't easy to find a partner to grow old with.. </p>
<p>Since I turned 18 I had the intense desire to have NY child. Knowing I couldn't keep a woman happy all the way, and at the time being a little confused, I fell for a woman twice my age. She was separated and we spoke about having a kid but splitting custody.Things didn't turn out well and we broke up. This happened 3 years ago.</p>
<p>A few months earlier I spoke to her. We got talking and she asked about my relationship status (she knew I was gay when we were together). I told her I had given up on finding a partner male or female.. But I still wanted a baby. She suggested I go for either surrogacy or adoption. </p>
<p>I'm really confused guys... Am I right in my desire of a child? If I am, should I wait for a partner or go it solo? Adoption or surrogacy? </p>

<h1>GCI- My my what a beautiful thought- to be a parent. But dear there are some things that you need to understand if you are an Indian gay guy. U see Indian adoption and surrogacy laws are fucked up.</h1>
<p>1- In India you cannot be openly gay to adopt a child for the time being atleast.
2- Even if you show urself strt or whatever you are gonna face multiple issues and hurdles while adopting a child because U R A MAN... and men has established norms of patriarchy to put only females on the role of parent (no matter how fucked up she is a person).
3- U can't go for surrogacy either because the procedures are not MALE-FRIENDLY.
4- U can neither ask for any help because it is per se granted or permitted only by the law.
5- India voted against LBGT spouse benefits at UN along with China, Russia, Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh ( so no chance until the law is repealed ).
6- The only possible way is to use ur INDIAN JUGADI brains or to get a child adopted of ur kith and kin and that too by not being open to morons. U can chose ur own path in how to have a surrogated child too.</p>
<p>P.S- Some time back I saw a video of a woman slapping her baby of maybe 2-3 months old because he was hungry and was crying due to hunger.
"A parent is not defined by their gender..They are defined in how efficiently they raise a child to be a better person in its life".</p>
