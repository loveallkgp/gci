<p>Hi admins and followers. Thanks for this platform. I dont choose to normally post here because i never needed the precious anonymity it provides. I am an open and out gay man and pride myself in living a totally open life. I have lived a very average and pretty mellow life....and still do. But because i m out and open...a lot of people look up to me as a effing hero. I know i m not one..all i did was for my own sake. But i have let that get to my head somehow. Almost daily some guy pings me to chat about my circumstances and how i overcame them. I oblige to most because i feel that the least i could do is help others relate to my experiences and find their own courage. And in this way i have ended up befriending a lot of people. The downside of this is...i have not been able to give them all the time and attention that they deserve and often ended up hurting them all somehow. I want to help and support as many as i can or at least not give anyone the cold shoulder. But it doesn't seem possible. I dont know how people like Harrish or Sonal and many others do it. I wish i could be there for all of them but thats a futile thought. I had never imagined i would ever be in this position. I know i sound like a narcissistic megalomaniac. But i couldn't post it on my timeline so i sought the anonymity provided here. Hats off to u admin for being such a proactive and helpful guy who found a way to help so many people by this page. I hope i too can come up with a more effective way to help as many people i can.</p>

<p>You are doing a really good job. Keep it up. God bless you!</p>
