<p>Dedicated to the Lord Almighty and to the gladly gays:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Lord, Thanks for making me a Gay. Now in my 23rd age. I have come to a conclusion that 90% of the world will not accept me and in that 10 % who accept me, 9% will not respect me for I being a gay. They will definitely accept me, but acceptance means i am considered as one with a strange non-communicable disease or with a sympathetic disability .</p>
<p>The remaining 1% will be out of reach and I should I spend the rest of my life in searching for those people so as I would gain little respect and acceptance ? I dont want to run behind people for acceptance. That is not a wise idea.</p>
<p>So anyway the world is not going to accept me, that I have decided to better concentrate in other areas of life. I have got a new strength and courage in other immoralities of the society. Now I can boldly make others excommunicate for the depth of immoralities they commit as a counter-par or revenge or whatever you call it, for they would excommunicate me had they known that I am gay.</p>
<p>Now I find a different kind of freedom and liberty inside me once I have decided not to be in pursuit of a life partner or acceptance or some respect. This freedom gives me a different kind of courage and boldness to concentrate in other paths of life, for there are millions in my country who are not properly fed for Generations. It brings me tears when I see those million kids in India with Bright eyes but clueless to know what to do with their life. I have long back included them as a part of me. 'With all due respect to the gay rights activists, I personally feel it is an unjust to shout for my gay rights when there are million others who deserve to have eaten their dinner before they go to bed, but go to bed ( and so not getting a sound sleep ) without a handful of food.</p>
<p>Therefore, lord, I will not complain anymore about my orientation and acceptance, as I am getting food every night and I have a sound sleep every night. Thank you for everything for what you have done/going to do for I am what I am. I am perfectly fine, contented and gratified of your overwhelming mercy and benevolence towards me.</p>
<p>If you want to give me more, give me a sound health for I should work for another 200 years to fight against the injustice being done by mankind on mankind and the rest of the planet. Give me money, money in billion crores then I would gladly run across the world filling the stomach of millions of human lives, both in the Bharat and outside of it. Its enough of it, I just cannot find one excuse, one excuse for why my fellow humans being poor. I am done with crying. Give me never ending joy, the reason-less joy that would sprung from the bottom of my heart and depths of my soul for no apparent reason, for being Human is just a great possibility and happening; the magic of life is life itself, the meaning of life is life itself.</p>
<p>If possible, just if possible, send your that one ambassador, the Deva-thoodan whom I always wish for; imagine for. So that we both can share a life and together can work for humanity. Its completely fine if no ambassador is coming form you to give me some love. Yes, its completely fine, as this is not my only priority. Just that I will be little more happy. If you think that will mess the whole thing up, then better not send any ! Thank you once again for what you have done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yours loving creation,
Just another human being who is bound to die in some 60 years. </li>
</ul>
<p>will be great if you post it !</p>
