<p>Dear admin.. I am so glad that you are running this page for lgbtq community of India. Thanks for letting me put my thoughts out through this page.</p>
<p>I am 22 year old turning 23 this July which is great. I completed the Post-graduation recently form a well known university of India, &amp; obviously i am gay. Professionally i am a model Turned actor. Recently i am Young through a rough path. I can'T even figure out what driven in me lately. All i think about is an uncertainity of mg future &amp; struggle that i am gonna have. I was so damn excited about getting my PG degree and do what i love to do. But lately everything seems impossible &amp; blurry from top to bottom. Having a conservative middle class family &amp; struggle that I made in my whole life is pushing me into a darker position. Honestly I don't know what I am writing now &amp; why I am writting..!!!
Acting career is going so well but something is missing &amp; I can't figure out what is that missing thing. Please help me to find out what's exactly happening with me. I am completely broken from inside. HELP ME!!!</p>
<h1>GCI- Honey, you have to take some time and spend it on yourself and find answers. You cannot continue to live with depression and other mental health issues. If you can and if you want, please seek help from a certain LGBT friendly therapist. There is no shame in that. Also, try to focus on your achievements, rather than the negative stuff in your life that is pushing you down. Life is hard, but it's you who should have the survival's instinct.</h1>
