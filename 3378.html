<p>"#AjeebLoveStory</p>
<p>I'm Rajat 23 from Delhi and a year ago I fell for this 19 years old cutie pie from Bengal. We've been more than just best friends when he was in Bengal, we use to chat late night on what's app and things were pretty much great between us until he got admission in a college in Ahmedabad. </p>
<p>when he got shifted there his life got pretty busy because of college stuff and all. But our bonding grew more stronger because we were emotionally connected. late night calls became our daily routine and this is how he finally became the part of my life or rather I shall the he's the oxygen to my lungs n heart. he knew that I love him a lot. </p>
<p>but unfortunately 5 months ago he fell for a sexy guy who already was in relationship with someone else so his heart was bound to be shattered. I don't know what happened between both of them but my Bengali Kutta, my friend has changed now. we don't chat enough. our long never ending chats end up in few seconds now and he remains sad all the time. 
I know that he can't love me back the way I love him but frankly speaking then the way he hurts himself everyday n night brings me down to tears n breaks me apart. </p>
<p>I know he lives alone so that's the reason why he's upset and also he's going through brokenheartness period but I just can't see him in so much pain now. he's breaking contacts with me and going in depression. </p>
<p>I just want him back the way we were earlier, I still love him a lot but I don't expect the same in return. all I want is him to stay happy and take care of his heart because his heart was supposed to be mine :'(</p>
<p>love you loads kutte, hope you learn to smile forever. "</p>
