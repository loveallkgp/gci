<p>you guys say wait for atleast 6months before sharing bed between two love birds. I appreciate that. But in my case I can't control myself to go for it. Im burning in each n every moment. Gimme some suggestions.            We are in a relation of one months. Im 21yo bottom. On the other hand, my bf is vers, calm, well behaved, &amp; till now he didn't give any dirty sign. </p>
<h1>GCI : 'wait for 6 months ' isn't hard and fast rule. it was for those people who complain ' all people want is just sex' and after one night  they leave .</h1>
<p>otherwise it depends on couple when they want to start having sex . 
as said your bf is well behaved that maybe the reason he isn't asking for sex as he might think this will make you uncomfortable or might be he is waiting for you to start on it. </p>
<p>if you want to get physical maybe you shall talk to him. if he is comfortable about it you two can have it .</p>
