<p>heya!</p>
<h1>Age21</h1>
<p>I'm confused. few days back my elder sister 'ransacked' my gay profile -<em>- . on the next morning (apparently it was her birthday too) she started giving me HINTS, she started by telling me that she always have an eye on me .</em>. , the next thing, she started revealing the cheesy non-veg statuses that I post .<em>. the 'about me' section .</em>. and yes my messages too.
1) she's like 'you're such a big chuppa rustam'
2) she NEVER used the word GAY, not a single topic over my sexual preferences, which was quite obvious a TOPIC after discovering my account.
3)she's exactly the same as before, when she confronted me I acted cool (cause I was thinking about a COME OUT )
4) I asked her whether she told mom everything and she said hasn't and never Will.</p>
<p>I never expected such a behaviour. is it a total acceptance or a total denial, idk. I really want to talk about it cause you know people are so judgemental and I do feel I can convince her that I'm cool with it &lt;3 and there's no STRAIGHT way for me. its not a choice, I was gifted!</p>
<h1>GCI- You can talk with her about it. Make her sit down and come out from your side even if she knows everything. On the plus side, she knows everything so you being scared to tell her doesn't even matter.</h1>
