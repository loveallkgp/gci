<p>I'm 20 n my bfrnd is 21. We met 7 months ago in one function. We hve got close to each other gradually &amp; not like many other couples who meet once n next meet is on the bed. We gave each other enough space n time to understand one other. After 3 months we met, we actually had sex where else we were only upto oral. Before we both were virgin. N yes we both are Versetile couple. We have good understanding n trust between us. On this Valentines Day we planned n met on his farm house which was all alone to us. We spend our  all 24 hrs of the day there making love with each other like rabbits. In the evening when he was doing me he was whispering all long in pleasure " I love u, I can't b without u, u r my life..." N i was there overwhelmed with joy and tears in my eyes. I loved him with all my senses before and now I love him with all my soul. </p>
<h1>Viv- Awwwhhhh! How sweet is that!! Wish you both a very happy life ahead!!</h1>
