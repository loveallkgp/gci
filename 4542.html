<p>Hi Everyone...
Guys and specially admin please answer my question honestly.. What you think about hot guys? You think they can become loyal boyfriend? or Can they have a loyal boyfriend who just wont be with them bcz of their looks n all..??
I am 22yrs old from Delhi.. Frankly speaking I m hot, handsome guy with very down to earth personality, soft spoken, interactive, loving and caring. I am looking for a boyfriend who is between 22-24. He should be a bit handsome n moreover I need an educated, clean, mannered guy like me. I want to live my life with that 1 person. My parents know that I am gay. I am alone and I need true love for forever. I got many proposals from many guys but all running just behind my looks...No 1 tried to know about me, they directly say I Love You... Arre jabtak aap kisi ko jaanoge nhi too aap ekdumse kaise pyaar kar skte ho... Pyaar hamesha dheere dheere hota hai over the time...</p>
<p>Please help me guys... I am depressed, low and not at all well bcz of this.... I am tired of trying... My mom says I have lost my smile in d midst of this loneliness and tiring search for true love... I just need a true lover for myself.... You guys and this page is my last hope..
Thank u... :) (sad smile)</p>
<h1>GCI- Well, for some "hot guys", they are full of themselves and yes people do pay much emphasis on looks. So whenever you are set to date someone, make sure the person should be according to what you desire and then you slowly get to know each other. Explain your whole thinking process like how you feel about the relationships and how they should be taken forward. If you still feel that they guy is taking the step ahead too fast too soon, you can always back off. At the end, genuine guys have not really gone from the world.</h1>
