<p>hello admin !!
u r doing great work :*
I want some suggestions
here is my first confession</p>
<p>sorry for long confession :(
I am a engg student final year .
In 12 standard I was sent to another city for prepration of comp. exam. Here I found a boy of my age and son of my uncle of my city already studying there. As I am totally new there I become his friend.I had attraction in boys (started at that age) .I get attached to him. He is like my brother.at that time I was unaware of sex(f***king) but yes I know about kissing etc .one night he approached me but I was totally scared so nothing happen .Next day he said sorry but I think this was something good but don't wanna do this(confused at that time but don't want sex).Later at each night he tried to fuck me but nothing happened.But after some days he fucked me and I think that he loved me.In several months my feelings for him were at the top and he know it.But after the completion of my preparation he loses interest in me . and he visited my home each month for sex and he had also taken some money from me by saying that he need in urgent .I have blind faith on him.But after reading other stories I think that I was a fool . Yes I realize but its late and who Abhi bhi aata h Ghar par and mein na nhi kr pata becoz of body need :( what can I do :(</p>
<p>after that in my first year of engg I found a boy and have strong feelings for him but he never use me.(he is committed to someone)
even after knowing truth I can't hide my feelings and today 3 years are completed after that incidence.Now I also want a friend or partner but can't trust any one :(
want to meet someone but afraid to meet(don't know why)
feeling like dead
my study are totally off
what should I do?
admin your suggestion first plz</p>
<h1>GCI- All I can say is, find your own feet. Don't depend on others for your survival. Be your own friend first and love yourself.</h1>
<p>It was a great american drag queen with a swollen vagina who said, "Honey, if you can't love yourself, how the hell you're gonna love somebody else?" </p>
<p>But honestly, try to have an independent brain rather than depending on other.</p>
