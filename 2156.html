<p>why are bottom gays at the lowermost step of gay social ladder 
and<br>
feminine bottoms fare even worse 
now admin plz dont harp on the same line about self respect , confidence nd all<br>
wen ppl kill ur confidence all the tym - den how can u expect other person to feel good 
 why cant tops ever understand how bots feel .. ?  </p>
<h1>GCI : it is true .. but not totally true. not all bottoms are same not all tops are same . no i am not going to lecture here about self respect , character or anything else .</h1>
<p>but lets just agree bottoms present themselves as slaves, sex objects , to attention of most of the tops and to choose the desired one . tell me this way where will you find somebody who will respect u.</p>
<p>and let me show u the other  side of coin . where most of tops are saying their bottoms lovers love them for their dicks not for them as person . here is one saying '' i was on a job trip when my bottom lover sent me message asking for my dick pic as he was missing my dick ''.... suroprisingly he didn't say he is missing me .</p>
<p>but here i agree that feminine gays are having worst life when coming to gay world as they get tortured and mocked by own some gay fellows . but that all will change with time as its social desease and can't be treated until laws are made and freedom is given to trans people, to gays .</p>
