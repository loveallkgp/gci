<p>My boyfriend and I are living in bengaluru .......we start dating in college n we love each other ......after completing degree.... We left our home town n continuing job before few months ...we arrange to get flat for us ......now we are living like couple (of course our parents are not here) but from few weeks my bf is behavingweird he wants to fuck me on every single occasion.... No doubt even I like sex but he is nearly all time asking me for sex ....I know him from many years but this behavior is strange......he ask me to do fun everywhere like bedroom, bathroom, kitchen even some time in car n elevators also....last two weekends I m only on my bed or in shower with him ....I m too much worried about him.....I even try to ask him why is he behaving like this ....he said he can't control himself from few weeks.....do we need to get help from some doctor or sexologist or psychologist.... Will it cause some legal problem if seek help from medical experts because of lgbt ban??</p>
<h1>GCI- Maybe he is just fulfilling his fantasies? But elevator is a bit too much. Just give him some time. He will calm his dick down. It's a phase that some people go through periodically. Until then just enjoy.</h1>
