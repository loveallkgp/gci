<p>Hey everyone
Going through the comments on that retarded ex justice personage..I came across a person with a mass comm background now presently employed in the judiciary..he seemed a stauch supporter of that 'dead' human being..even many of my fellow mates are still ignorant or semi literate about homosexuality...P.S- We are mass comm students and they never bully me bcoz of my extrovert nature...what to say now???</p>
<h1>GCI- They don't bully you because they can't victimize you. And on internet they can say anything. Even I was having a conversation with a lawyer who was his supporter. He gave an opinion that homosexuality is against nature and the usual shit.</h1>
<p>I asked "Just because you are not gay, you are justified in your views?"</p>
<p>He said, "Give your point or don't reply to my comment."</p>
<p>I replied, "I want to know the reason behind your comment which you didn't give. Can you please write it down?"</p>
<p>He replied, "You people have nothing else to say and that solidify my beliefs against you people. I say now, do not reply to my comment."</p>
<p>I said, "I can give my demeaning opinion on heterosexuality as well. I have many things to say but that will be just as pointless as your opinion. To have a meaningful argument I need to know the reason which YOU are not providing at all."</p>
<p>And after that the debate started on his thread. Just like Katju he was impervious to thinking and learning and in the end he bid goodbye because he "thought" that he was "successful" in defeating me and one more guy in the debate.</p>
