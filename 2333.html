<h1>Ash 19,</h1>
<p>We all are very active. We post Social reforming posts, suggestions. Try to improve the ideologies of people. And even tackle the stereotypical attitude. This confession page help people very much. Our posts generates awareness. But anyone have any idea that we are working on a very minute level.
I mean those who are sex seekers, will only search for sex stories or partners, no one of them will try good things.
First we have to improve the people among us only and we are doing it, by various means.
Daily we post valuable statuses, and most interesting thing is that, only counted people present views over it.
Everyone advice, we must do this n that to improve the image of our community. And we say, straight people are discriminative, they are stereotype, don't understand the feelings. they Bully.
How 'how' can we create awareness to them as well?? Until we don't come out from this little hub of gay pages and groups. How can we improve image of gay people, without coming out of this well.
Just tell me how can I do my bit for us?? </p>
<h1>GCI- To make others understand we have the need to go out. To go out we ourselves much be educated and have a strong mind. Through pages like this and other awareness pages only people can learn and those who have guts will do take a stand out in the open. But as everything starts at the ground level, its the gay people of our country who must be educated and should be made to feel proud about themselves in whatever means possible.</h1>
