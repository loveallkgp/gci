<p>Okay! I'm a 17 year old 12th grader from the north east. In our country, homosexuality isn't just not accepted but often ignored. I've come out to some of the closest people in my life and they've all been very supportive. So far, so good. Now the dilemma is I wanna date someone. And since I know no other open gay guy in person, I've taken to the internet by using fake profiles. Initially I was shocked to see that there are so many gay guys around my place. It was exciting. But the excitement didn't last long. Soon it seemed normal and then gradually disappointing. I'm not someone who believes in casual sex or hook ups. And I'm desperately looking for 'love' in this online world. So my question is, is it worth it? Are all of these chats worth going through to find someone to have a meaningful relationship with? Can you find someone to have a relationship with online? Am I just wasting my time? </p>
<h1>gci- you are preaching to the choir brother. Don't loose hope yet. Maybe it isn't the right time.</h1>
