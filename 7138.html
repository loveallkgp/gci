<h1>GCI- He is married, has a kid and he is gay. He made a mistake in his life but now he has to live with it. You on the other hand have to drift away. You don't want to be the third wheel in their married life. You have a future to build and some situations like these can ruin it for you. Learn from others mistakes and try not to do them in your life.</h1>
