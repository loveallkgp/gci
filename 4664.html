<p>Not a confession actually just want to share something :)
Meet me, I am 19, a student from Calcutta. You know, then, I never knew what the term GAY meant. I just knew about a love that is possessed by a boy for another boy, but I didn't know that the we have a term for it too. Oh, let me tell you I'm talking about the time when I was of perhaps 7 years of age. My mom used to watch a daily soap of Star Plus which was called Kasauti Zindagi Key. There, the main protagonist Cezanne Khan aka Anurag Basu was my first crush(platonic). I used to have dreams of him kissing on my cheeks and all, obviously then, I didn't see somebody kissing on lips. From then I felt that I have feelings for men. It was the first instance which is what I remember till date.
Second instance was a nocturnal emission but before moving on let me brief you that by this instance I had never watched any kind of pornography and neither have I ejaculated. I was dreaming that a man residing in Australia (Australia because I vaguely remember having a glance of the Sydney Harbour Bridge) was coming up to me from the water shirtless (just like what Daniel Craig did in Casino Royale) and I had my first ejaculation (nocturnal emission to be precise).
By the time, as I grew up, I have now realised that God has sent me like this and I can't change myself even if I want to. I had recently come up with my nature (I would rather not prefer saying "sexual orientation") to my parents and they have approved even of it. Just want to thank three people, first God who sent me like this unlike others who are according to society referred to normal people. I feel unique. And second and third are my parents for supporting me with my decision.
Lastly, I know I'm making you guys bore, I just want to say that #GCI I'm in love with you :p ;) </p>
<h1>GCI- And we love you too for such an amazing confession. God knows I need some happy stories these days. Ugh.</h1>
