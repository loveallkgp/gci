<p>and the truth is it is more hard for people like me to survive in this community where our own community's people think that we don't exist and all that shits :/ , At least if you are gay or straight you can live your life with any one person but for a BISEXUAUL guy like me what will i do in future i get attracted towards both genders(Physically &amp; mentally as well)? for some of you for your kind information bisexual are not people who only use gay guys to fulfill their sexual desires.. like some straight people think gay only want sex likewise we are not only seeking sex form guys and will marry girls, THIS IS NOT TRUE AT ALL. thinking like this must be changed if our own community people think like this then how can we expect hetros to accept us? May be some people u will say to hide my sexual orientation i am saying i am bi &amp; that is your bullshit thinking, like you like a Dick or Pussy I like both :D (proud of it) like all gays are not same, we are also not same like some sex seeking bisexual so accept us(BISEXUALITY). the flag of our community defines that we are all not same everybody is different. and one main thing Bisexuality does exist. there are not alot of bisexual people who come out and talk about it so that most people hesitate to come out. i think i will do that but in the right time i.e when i will be standing on my own feet with a nice job.. :D . thanks for reading haha</p>
