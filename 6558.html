<p>Hello friends. I met a guy online and chatted for few months. He was a pure top and I am pure bottom. We met and fell in love. One day when my parents were out, we met at my house for fun. However he kept doing body sex and oral and was not agreeing to insert. Shocked I asked him reason and he said he had lied. He was a pure bottom too. He just didn't want to lose me since he liked my chats. So he had lied top after hearing I am bottom. I also didnt suspect since he looked manly and didn't act feminine. I angrily shouted at him and kicked him out. I thought he was the love of my life but his cheating broke my heart. Why are gays such hypocrites?</p>
<h1>GCI- Again the top bottom drama. Spare me the horror, sil-vous-plait.</h1>
