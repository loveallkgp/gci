<p>i am a 29 yr old gay guy from mumbai. Last year my bf broke up with me. We were a couple for almost 2 years. He used to say we will move to europe or canada and get married. Then he got married to a girl and cut off all relation with me. He said his mother tried to commit suicide by drinking phenol after he told her he was gay and didn't want to marry. He asked me never to call him since he's straight now and didn't want his family to die bcoz of me. So I left him alone and was in depression and bad health for several months. I needed lot of mental strength to pull through. I know he had a fake gay profile. So recently on our one year break up anniversary, I chatted with him using another fake profile just out of curiosity. He is still actively seeking sex on that inspite of having a wife and kid. He calls himself pure top single there. Even though hes married, used to bottom with me and used to say he's gay. It was pathetic and I was really hurt. How many lies can one tell and how much fake can one be just for the sake of sex and fear of society?</p>
<h1>GCIL- Honey u will meet many more like him. The question is how many times u want to be depressed for assholes like him and ruin ur beautiful life?? Just make it more beautiful without anybody..that counts more these days!</h1>
