<p>i am bisexual ..
i had a girlfriend with whom i was very serious for relationship but she cheated on me and it got over... so i was very sad for almost 3-4 months and in that time 2 of my friend supported me to move on. pne is girl and another is boy... the boy is gay... i knw this coz we are very close thats why he shared this to me and even he loves me as he said but i never mentioned him that even i am bisexual.</p>
<p>and when i was sad for months i got his company with another friend (girl).
and in this situation i dont know when i have started to like him ..
and in Christmas time we three friends were been to mall for celebration.. and that time i came to know that the friend(girl) likes me coz she directly proposed me but honestly i wanted to propose my friend (boy) thats why i rejected her proposal.</p>
<p>she went off alone and i too dint stopped her coz i wanted to say something to him alone..</p>
<p>so i holded his hand and i said i am bisexual and i like you then he said he has got his boyfriend last 3months ago with whom he is serious and doesnt want to cheat... he called him up and introduced him to me...</p>
<p>and after that time i stopped contacting both friend (girl and boy) ...</p>
<p>now i am all alone jobless becoz of exgf and single bcoz of my that gay friend .. what a fucking life i have got...</p>
<p>New Delhi</p>
<h1>Viv- Awwww... That is so cute and sad. But baba, don't get sad. You will have someone who will love you more that you were ever loved. Try to keep your friendship and romantic life different with a fine line. And also keep your professional and personal life different. You will be much more happy if you practice this. Even if 2 gays are together doesn't mean that they have to be bf-bf. No. You can be very good friends too. So I think you should contact him and be his friend, just like he became yours when you knew he loved you but he still stuck to you. Have a great life, honey.</h1>
