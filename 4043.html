<p>About me: I am a very shy person I am so shy that i haven't even dated any guys yet. I talk to gay people on PR/FB but i never reveal my true identity.</p>
<p>My story: In college there was this very pretty girl, many of my friends (mostly girls) told me she likes me a lot. I was surprised coz she is like very pretty i'm just okay she was a 9 pointer i just a 6 plus other stuffs too so i thought that my friends are just pulling of a lame prank. Then after 6-8 months I too started to realize that she is into me coz she took great deal of interest in me, she got annoyed when i was talking to other girls n she always got too excited around me n all.</p>
<p>Till then I have had two great crushes in fact I truly believed I was in deep love with those guys but unfortunately both of them were straight and so I was left heartbroken. But now this extremely pretty girl had a crush on me so despite the fact that i'm gay i was a little excited. When i told my mum about this she too got excited and after that she kept on telling me go out on a date with her. I was too shy to ask her out but one day I was giving my friends my birthday treat (including her) and after the party she asked me out. She said the date would be like a birthday gift. I was actually very happy but I decided that once the date was over I would tell her that I didn't fancy her (not giving her the exact reason why?)</p>
<p>Since it was my 1st date ever I really really wanted it to be perfect so I actually brought chocolates and a yellow rose and kept it in my bag planning to give her after the date and since a guy must pay the bill on a date I decided I wouldn't let her pay the bill. On the day of the date we got into taxi and I told her that coz its a date I'll pay. We started fighting over this from the taxi to the restaurant, the fight got so worse that she asked me to leave n so i left but i felt so sad and angry that within 30 minutes of that incident I called my mom n told her I'm gay and thats how I came out of the closet.</p>
