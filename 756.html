<p>I don't want to start a pity party out here or anything. I am just confessing..blabbering random bullshit that comes to my mind when I think of that incident. It happened last night when Rishabh spent the night at my place. Now, I have known that he was committed since the beginning, okay? And he is sort of my kinds, twinky and intellectual, and he had known that I kndaf liked him. Although liking is just liking for me.. I mean if I like you, I may want to have sex with you, but I can be totally platonic as well. I get the ground realities as far as that is concerned. However, he has never really been displeased with my liking of him or anything. We have been out, and have hold hands, when we would walk, we'd just let our palms and hands rub together, and wouldn't really mind and all that.. I didn't overthink that, and took it just as it was.. Last night we got late in returning from the Jazz festival, and when we reached Rajiv Chowk, he was quite unsure whether he should board the blue line towards his place or not. I offered that he could spend the night at mine, I wouldn't really mind. He thought about it for a while and then agreed.
We reached my home, as we weren't really hungry, so left for my room. I gave him an old t-shirt of mine and he changed. Now, we spread the mattress on the floor, and there was this single bed as well. I asked him where he'd like to sleep. So he laid down on the mattress and said "yahin pe." I told him I can go sleep downstairs as well (I have a 4 storied house, stay with family, so sadly, no place) but he said "kya zaroorat hai, itni jagah hai toh.. thodi der baatien karenge, then we'll sleep.."
I was honestly okay with it, and dint have sex on my mind at all. So we laid there, talked, and he came a bit closer. I was fine.. We held hands, talked, listened to songs on the phone and sort of resigned to sleep. Eventually, I felt his ass near my hand.. usne side karvat le li thi and apni ass thodi meri taraf kar di.. I enjoyed the random touch of his soft little twinky ass, but continued to pretend to be sleeping.. he dint move away his ass, kept it right there, and would sometimes be more touchy.. it was cold and I felt like sleeping on my side, so I turned towards him and laid down on my side. He brought his ass closer, just enough to brush it with my crotch. I put my hand on his waist and hugged him from back. He dint move, I dint move, but we just lied there like that. After sometime, he straightened up, while I was on my side. His face was really close to me now, so much so that we start breathing the same breaths. He moved his lips a centimeter closer to mine, and in that moment, I went with the flow and kissed his lips. HE KISSED BACK and before I know I was over him, kissing and smooching him and he had his hands in my hair, pulling them, touching my face, and kissing me deeply. I started stroking him. He i could sense that we was hard too.. he stretched his neck, and I bit him there - not a hickey but an actual bite.. I grabbed his ass from one hand, pulled up his t-shirt and kissed his nipples with urgent passion and desire and then kissed back his lips.. we continued making out for next 5 minutes when suddenly he stopped me. He dint even say no, but just stopped. I was like wtf! I stopped, and then he just slept. It took me a while to calm myself down. I went to the next room and smoked, came back and slept too.
In the morning he was completely okay. Like nothing had happened. He talked normally, dressed up. Had breakfast and left.
I asked him "so what does last night mean to you?"
He replied "it was a night. we slept. what meanings are you drawing from it?"
Me: We dint exactly just sleep, did we?
He: Yeah! Unless you were hallucinating something.
Me: I bit your neck, when I was on top of you. Remember that?
He: What rubbish. It was just a rash. Dude what are you talking about?</p>
<p>He has been talking the way he did. Like nothing has happened. But honestly, I cant pretend. It has happened for me. And that was no mistake. He wasn't drunk, I wasn't drunk, we fucking made out and enjoyed it and then he stopped it. What does he wanna do now? Talk about his boyfriend troubles with me? I dont want to. I want to fuck him now. Lahu muhh lag gaya types. At least I want him to own up to whatever happened last night and decide whether we wanna forget about it, or not. I know he is committed, but I know his relationship has died out the initial flare. And although I am not really a fan of breaking up, but whatever. He did cheat on him with me, and that's really none of my concern. He cannot just use me like a dildo and get on with life. What is this sort of behavior? What should I do..? </p>
<h1>Viv- Denial denial.. its so common these days. Next time tu uska KLPD kar diyo.. Don't even touch him if he makes any move. Don't listen to his bf problems and do not pretend to have sex with him. Then will he know how to treat you.</h1>
