<p>"Hi guys, this is the confessor of post 3392. I'm the guy who paid for his bf's sex with a call boy.  I hate describing myself this way. 
Thanks a lot for all your comments and feedback. Someone mentioned that I may be asexual, this got me thinking. To be honest, I've never heard about this term till now. I'm trying to gather as much information as I can about asexuality. After some reading, I think I'm asexual. I generally have an aversion to sex, even while watching porn I like the kissing, cuddling, undressing part but not the actual penetration. 
Now I'm even more confused. I've never been attracted to girls either emotionally or romantically. When my friends talk about boobs, etc, I would get bored and walk away. I used to love chatting with guys and staring at cute guys in my college, that made me think I'm gay. So I wanted to find a life partner and settle down, after a lot of hunting i found my man. We found a lot of common ground between us and decided to commit to a relationship. Though thinking of it now, I don't think I actually ""loved"" him, I was glad to find a person who understood me, understood my feelings and cared for me. I did consider asking him about marriage but I think it was mainly to keep him with me, all to myself. Now that I found out that he wants sex, I think it's best to break up with him. I don't think it's fair to continue with this setup. In my defense, he did say he was ok with the ""no sex"" part.
How do you go about a breakup? Should I  use the classic ""It's not you, it's me"" line, it is the truth!!</p>
<p>My next doubt is- How many people are asexual and realise it? Anybody on this page? If I am indeed asexual, then does it matter if I marry a girl who is asexual too? Or would this be like a gay marrying a lesbian just to please the society( I'm personally against this.) </p>
<p>Oh God! Why is my life so complicated? Please admin give me some answers. I'm really desperate. </p>
<p>"</p>
<h1>gci- Honey, this time you gotta make a decision yourself because it has to be you and not me.</h1>
