<p>M, 28, confused.
10 years back, I fell in love with a guy - Suman. We were very close, but couldn't accept that we were gays. Our attraction was never physical, although we liked sleeping cuddled and glued. We gave much thought to our life and decided to separate for good.</p>
<p>We hadn't met for 6 years and I had no idea of his whereabouts. 2 years back I came across another guy - Tushar (few years older to me) in my office, whom I did not like initially but later became good friends after knowing that he is married to one of my classmates. I am in Hyderabad and due to my travelling job, I don't have local friends, so I kept constantly hanging out with Tushar.</p>
<p>6 months back I went out of city, and I found myself constantly longing for Tushar. He also kept me calling and asked to come back. I came when my work got over in a month and when we met, he hugged me tightly for unusually long time and kissed on my forehead. Now few office workers have indirectly commented on our chemistry, which I am trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in last months trip to Delhi, I accidentally met Suman. Though, I think about him every night, I did not feel a thing after seeing him. He hugged me, but my response was so superficial, he felt sad.</p>
<p>After that I have become very confused and I have few questions. I got this page from FB and found the members very supporting and interactive. Please help me...
1. Wasn't my love for Suman not real ? If, No.. then why do I miss him every night ? If, yes, why I did not feel anything when we met ?
2. Is Tushar gay/bi... ? Should I speak to him about it ?
3. Am I gay ? I do not get attracted to guys or girls physically. Should I see a psychologist ?
4. If Tushar approaches me (which is very likely), what should I do ?
5. Suman is trying to reconnect. He is married. What should I say to him ?
5. Another friend, a girl, has proposed me. I think I can be happily married to her. Should I go ahead or wait for few years to resolve my identity ? Also, I am scared to loose her.</p>
<h1>GCI- Your love/feelings for Suman were real. That's why you missed him every night. Now as you moved on and a new guy entered, you were more drawn towards him. As he was not the focus of your life, your feelings grew more for the second guy. If you were really in love, you wouldn't have lost your focus. The second guy can be gay/bi/straight. You have to know that even straight guys have feelings and some of them really show them. Not every straight guy is upitty and bound by society rues and all.</h1>
<p>Now as the first guy is trying o reconnect, you can be friends with him, just don't do anything with him. You also have to remember that he has a wife. For the last one, if you really thing you can keep her happy and that it will not be a disaster for you, then you can go forth and marry the girl. If I was on your side, I wouldn't do that.</p>
