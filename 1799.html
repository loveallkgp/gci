<p>Hey this is Aarush, and I'm really fucked up -_-
do guys even know who you are?
Suppose this is your love story..</p>
<p>''You are a teenager, u get to know something is unique about u, that u like guys. Then u came to know this thing is called homosexuality/bisexuality. For the initial few months, u're really curious about having sex. U have sex and then comes to know that u like fucking more then being fucked i.e. U're kinda top. Now sex isn't u want, u want a partner, a soul mate whith whom u can spend ur whole life. You find one and he is too cute. U become friends with him and somehow fall for him. You fall in love with him like hell, u can't saty away from him. One day u come to know that, that cutie pie u love is top too.''
please answer these questions honestly based on ur opinion and thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Would u stop loving that person or would ur love reduce for him after knowing his position? Give me reason..</li>
<li>If u're are bottom, why do u think u're bottom? Do u feel like u're a girl from inside?</li>
<li>If u're are top, tell me why u're top?</li>
<li>Who do u call gays? Are there any characterstics that they hold? If yes what are they?
And lastly
5 who are transgendr/transsexual/crossdresser in ur opinion?</li>
</ol>
<p>Do rply, :)</p>
<h1>Viv- Personally I'd not have any issues with the "position thingy" ANd being a bottom doesn't mean that you feel like a girl from inside. Being a top doesn't mean the person should be macho and being a bottom doesn't mean the person is girly. Seriously these are all stupid stereotypes according to me.</h1>
