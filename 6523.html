<p>Hey everyone,
I joined this group yesterday and it took me a day's time to go through stories, confessions, pictures etc of my fellow gay friends. Few stories really inspire you and few actually make you believe that you are no different, everyone is sailing on the same boat.
Today I want to say something, you may or may not consider this as a confession, but this is something most of us definitely face especially those who are not blessed with great looks or body.
I am sure you all got the hint.
I am 27 year old well settled guy who has everything that is needed to impress people( atleast that is what girls say) but the problem is i am 90 kilos. I talk to guys, they like my face, the way i talk, everything but when it comes to taking the next step and that is not sex but love, i hear this powerful sentence ie we arw good as friends..:(:(
I mean why is it that ur body or the way u luk makes a lot of difference. I mean we ppl are struggling with the fact that we are minorities and we are not accepted by the society then why is it that we have to struggle with our people.
I am sure many of us face this but then is it worth it, does it make any sense?</p>
<h1>GCI- Because we are gays and we are shallow as hell. We are worse than shallow, we are kiddy pool. Call me a cynical bastard but I have had it, officially.</h1>
