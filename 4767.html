<p>hi Mumbai here,</p>
<p>wann ask sumthing. ..not sure how to be on conclusion....</p>
<p>I am 28, family forcing me for marriage, but I am bit confused about my self how to categorize my self.
I like men, even had relationship, sex and while mistribute, I fantasized about men only, in this scenario I seems to be gay...
but on other hand I like girls as well, I look at them, wish to marry, to be with life partner, to have kids, to walk with my wife in long journey of life (never experiance sex with girl, but wish u have wife only...like one women man...)....in this case it seems to be stright. ....
plz suggests sumthing. ...I m confused. ...</p>
<h1>GCI- I read a story on a page that a person once, who was gay, got married to a girl but he was confused about his orientation just like you are. So he got married but on the first night only he realized the mistake that he did. You can be bisexual but from your confession it appears like you never really gave it a thought. At one point even I wanted a wife and kids but deep down I knew that I couldn't carry it. Acceptance is hard but if you do that, your life will be pretty easy.</h1>
