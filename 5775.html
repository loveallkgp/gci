<p>U seriously need to post this admin.. 
I was just going through the news on my phone wen I read this thing..
 " 7-Year-Old Boy Allegedly Sexually Assaulted, Set on Fire in Maharashtra's Bhiwandi "
I mean c'mon man.. R u serious..  this is utter shit.. </p>
<p>*Just because I am posting it here doesn't means I am trying to set any connection between The LGBT community and those fucking bastards.. They're just men who need a hole to have their dicks in..
I mean god..!! He was a kid.. He barely got any idea that he had a hole who some fucking hideous rapists could torture.. 
I cried.. But like million other people.. I just don't want to cry.. I am going to be the change I want to see in our society.. </p>
<p>So here I am,  begging b4 u ppl to spread this message like fire.. Let ppl like those arses know that we stand as one.. I want every man to know that if u want to have sex.. Plz go to assistances but shit like this is not going to be tolerated.. I demand them to be hanged till death.. We all demand justice.. </p>
<p>And a small msg to that innocent child who just lost his life for the sake of some ppl's thirst fr sex.. :'(</p>
<p>RIP for that lil 7 year old love.. Though u myt be a stranger but we're all humans.. And I love you unknown..  U in a far better place than here.. Where such ridiculous brutality is forced onto innocents like u.. &lt;3</p>
<h1>GCI- RIP the innocent soul....</h1>
<p>For that bastards and blots - DON'T EVER LET THIS HAPPEN IN UR AREA GUYS....WHO KNOWS IT MIGHT UR BROTHER....AND YES GAY OR NOT..A RAPIST IS A RAPIST....NO MERCY FOR SUCH SHITHOLES LIKE THESE!</p>
