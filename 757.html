we usually studied together at nights when we wer in class 12th.....nd on dose nights.....at sleeping....several tym we got physical......(not sex).....we hugged each other vry tightly in sleeps...we hv felt bulge of each odr....may a tyms while sleeping
...we came so close to each odrs dt our penis rubbed 2gthr...he would put his hand on mines nd too use to do d same wid hm......bt we hv nvr done anythng more thn dt....hv nvr done sex 2gthr...!!
it ol finished aftr 12th as we both got admutted into dfrnt courses....so no night studies 2gthr.....
bt few days back.....we got d chnc again....as my parents were out of station... he ws der wid me for 3 days.....at night too we wer 2gthr....bt nthng so happened like it use to happen previously.....!!!!
neither i took any step...nor he...!!!

n yup.....now also we r bst frnds....!!!</p>
<h1>admins....u guyzz r awsm.....n ur suggestions are really worthy...dts y i confessed it here....want ur suggestion!!</h1>
<h1>Viv- You know it happens in this age group. But as we grow up then straights will be straight, gays will be gays and tits will be tits. You cannot expect them to change for you as you can't change for them. Its true nature. Learn to live with it and move on.</h1>
