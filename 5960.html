<p>Hey friends i dont know i should post this or not I am really irritated depressed worried nd frustrated from last two days. Like all i am facing the pressure of marriage. My family even dont won't to ask me about my choice and they have fixed my marraige to girl. I protested every thing goes in vien . they emotional black mail that we will sucide that was my parrents answer. I took courage that i will tell everything to the girl i met the girl told her every thing about my sexuality that i am gay. I showed her the pics of my crossdressing dressed as a girl. That what role i play with my gay friends that i am pure bottom everything. She didn't said a single word and left for home. I thought that she would go home she will leave me and broke rhis marraige. But nothing has happened she still wants to marry me is she after my money whats in her mind i asked her is she a lesbian but she didn't answered. Might be its true or not Is she having a boyfriend and her family is not allowing to merry her she thought she can had a secret relationship with him Dear i am very much depressed frustrated worried what should i do where should i go. I have played the role of bottom always. I like to dress as females and act as females. I have no way left to do and go somewhere . I think cowards sucide.</p>

<p>''Cowards don't die once they die daily".....psychologically speaking suicide is actually the act of a firm decision where people try to find solace(in vain).
Listen dear if u r independent enough to face ur family then u must NOT SUCCUMB at all....They wanna suicide..LET THEM TRY but tell them please do write a suicide note of U not being guilty and that it is their personal decision....trust me Indian parents are real FATTUS...if told them to do so.!!..they act hypocrite, judgemental and emotional blackmailers all the time...this time act smart and take the ball in your courts and ask them to go ahead...just tell that If u dont care for my happiness and well being then i m being sorry for your decisions..pls go ahead may we shall meet in heaven..and for that girl....STAY AWAY FROM HER...she seemed to have evil intentions or seemed rather too dumb to be the next 'Priya vedi'..</p>
<p>CAUTION- U need to be super confident and mature enough to handle this melodrama for days or even months..just choose to die but don't succumb.
P.S- Here die doesn't mean literally dying..it means to be ready to face any shitload that may come ur way.</p>
