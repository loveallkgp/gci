<p>The bus was way too crowded. I was standing.
I felt someone staring at me. I turned. It was a dude, fairly good-looking. I'm 19 btw.
As I looked at him, he quickly diverted his eyes. I turned back.
Moments later, I felt someone's breadth on my neck. I was startled. I checked from the corner of the eyes, it was him! I didn't turn or do anything. Next thing I know, his arms had somehow surrounded me. Anger started building inside me. I did nothing however. Just then, I felt something on my ass. It was his dick...semi-erect dick. It was way too much for me to handle. I turned towards him...his face was maybe just ONE inch apart from mine, and he was probably sniffing my perfume. I glared at him. He got little scared, i guess. At the same time I shifted my ass so I was not touching him at all. Things were cool then.
About a minute later, his dick found its way to my ass again. I couldn't control my anger then. I turned to him with all rage and said "WHAT??" in probably low voice for others to notice.
The shameless whispered "enjoy!" - Can you believe it?
I stopped myself from shouting out loud at him somehow and whispered in the same tone "Ja ke apne PAPPA ko enjoy karaiyo. Piche Hatt." His expressions changed. He turned away. Didn't bother again.
Few minutes later when he was bout to get off, I said "Sunn...bhuliyo matt. Pappa...enjoy, huh?"
He never looked at me back.
Its not the first time something like this has happened. Other times, however, i just step aside and speak nothing. But its increasing day by day. Seems like bloody horny guys aren't just gonna stop. Such pigs need a nice answer to their faces. Bitches.
Seriously, I feel so disgusted traveling in public vehicles or even being in such public places. When people stare at me but its okay..i can live with it...but sexual harassment like this..fuck m never gonna let those bastards do it. Why cant these guys have some decency? I'm sure they are the one's who even tease the girls. Such men's dicks should be chopped off. Yes. :P</p>
<h1>GCI- I am sorry that it happened with you buddy. You did extremely well in a situation like that. Sexual harassment is sexual harassment and the person who does it, is a criminal regardless of his sexuality.</h1>
