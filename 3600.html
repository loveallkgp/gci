<p>last nyt he came on big boss now everybdy is gaying he is representing gay community in there.   nd i am asking who is he to represent us ???  did we elect him ??? No. we didnt. He was selected by channel to create a entertainment factor like everybody else. It does nt matter what his actions suggest or how he dresses. It is his way of life nd he have every right to live the same either private , public or national. But the least we can expect from him is to behave rational.
 my second query is what is wrong with the gay guys here. Their thinking is nothing different from straight guys.
Straight  dont like gays because they  think we are abnormal. Gays dont like girlish ones coz they are abnormal to them . So where does the difference here??? 
I guess nothing is wrong until u r assiciated with it.</p>
<h1>GCI- See, it now depends upon him and his behavior how to behave. I'd really like to see him toning down the ridiculous assumptions that people had made about him and certain stereotypes. If he does that, I will praise him beyond means. The only thing that bothers me is that people spew so much hate on him being a girly guy, something that we have witnessed n number of times on this page. People have indeed come up here and said they don't like girly guys. And now as sushant is in there who said that he represented india internationally in Mr. Gay International, it really was a threat to the "straight-acting" gay people. It added a question mark on their mardaangi. That's where all the fuss lies.</h1>
