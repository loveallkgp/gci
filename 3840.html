<p>Hello Everyone... hope you all are doing good...:) okay.. I need a suggestion... I'm 20... and I have accepted my sexuality and I'm so proud of it ..  I have been in only one relationship.. but it wasn't pleasant.. my ex broke up with me saying "gay is sin... our parents won't accept us..blah blah blah.."... at the age of 17, it broke me apart ... I was so dependent on him... wen he went, I felt like my whole world has broken down...after that I hadnt been in any relationship.. I couldn't bring myself trust guys... </p>
<p>Now after 3 years... I m in a relationship... I like my partner.. but the thing is... I don't know... I feel like he is pushing me... he asked me to close my fake fb account ... he says things like, " I love u seriously but I don't trust you..."...  but he gives me like 30mins, and asks me to send watever I want to say to him, so he can read and smile...but he won't do the same... he easily gets angry, and blocks me in whatsapp :( then unblocks me saying he forgave me...:'( I don't know wat to do... I feel like my relationship totally with whatsapp, not with him....</p>
<p>all I want is little love and care... I like him.. but will this relationship work..? </p>
<h1>GCI- Nope. it won't work.The basis of every relationship is trust. He has already said that he doesn't trust you, so I guess there is nothing much to be said. And what I feel is that he himself cannot trust on himself, that's why he doesn't trusts you either. He is being a self important person in this relationship and is considering you as a robot. So it would be better to not have feelings attached and go with the flow. if you think you cannot cope up with it, you can have a breakup.</h1>
