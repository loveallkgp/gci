<p>i am Fat. i am not good looking but when guys get to know me they fall for me i can't understand why.i am always nice to everyone always listen to their problem always give them a shoulder to cry on. But they don't know how emotionally/sexually/mentally broken i am on the inside.</p>

<h1>GCI- Its because you always allow others to speak first I guess. You never really put your stand infront of them and then normal for a human mind to get used to be listened. You listen to them and that's why they fall for you. Moreover, I guess you never really showed the need to be listened. Maybe you don't like to get dependent upon anyone. It all comes when there is a both way connection between you and your friends. The one who cares about you will urge you to tell things but if you put up a face as a strong one, no one will understand how you are feeling inside. Try to open up with the ones you feel that they do care for you.</h1>
