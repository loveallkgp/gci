<p>I went through many 'confessions' just now and there were many genuinely concerned people but dude all these sex with dad, sex with brother, cheesy stories sound pretty much bullshit. Either these are straight people trolling or may be I am wrong and sadly the stereotype image of the Indian gay community is pretty damn true. Administrator (big word) Don't you at times feel frustrated reading this stuff?
and anyone concerned about the the curative petition in SC 2 out of 4 judges are same old hogs dattu and the other guy who dismissed the case in matter of hours last time. so I guess SC route is getting pretty much over. and as much as I strongly feel that Modi/BJP will be good for the nation (well atleast better than MMS) they are not going to do anything through the parliament due to sm of their half crazy dolts like ramdev. What do you think gets pref? Nation or the personal stuff?
(may be all gays should join RSS, they dont marry and wear cool khaki Nickers :p)
well,it was not a confession so dont get angry (but thn there is lots of stuff here which is also not) m22/pseud</p>
<h1>Viv- Oh hell to the no. I am much better than whole RSS combined. And mata rambabe? Who is he?  Also buddy, is modi comes into power then by sure all these parties like sanghs, senas which claim to be the savior of religion and culture will have the full right to do atrocities and no one will question them. I don't know about the Judges of the hearing this time, it will be an open hearing. Hope they have a change of mind this time.</h1>
