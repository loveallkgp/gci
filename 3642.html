<p>I just dont get one thing. I talk to so many guys on my fake id. What i have observed so far is whoever says he's a gay is always an unmarried guy while those who claim to be bisexual are always married ones. No no...actually what i mean is any married man i have chatted so far claims to be bisexual. None of them have ever said they r gay. I have talked to many. I know i cant generalise things like this but mera experience toh yahi show karta hai that married men khud ko bisexual hi batate hain. 
So, now, my problem is not this. The thing i wanna ask, or discuss with you people is that, does marrying turns even gay guys bi ? shaadi karne ke baad why would everyone say they r bi ? while unmarried me most kahte hain they r gay. I'm a 100 percent gay guy and cant ever think of marrying some girl coz i cant have more guilt of destroying people's lives. mere se shaadi karne wali ladki ko main sisterly love toh de sakta hoon but more than that...i just cant, i know it. So, mere liye mera prince charming hi theek hai ! :P ;)
BUT BUT BUT...then again as we all deal with stuff called 'FAMILY PRESTIGE n HAPPINESS'......i dont need to tell much about it to u...as alll of us go with almost same conditions...so ese mein if i marry then family bhi khus ho jaayegi...aisa most gays think n marry (I cant do it, wont do it !!! ) .................Now tell me if someone marries, say i marry, then kya mera bhi 100 percent gay thing reduce ho jaayega..kya main bhi bi bann sakta hoon?? Coz for some of us, being a bi can be really good. 
I kinda really dislike bi people...its my personal opinion, but then again sometimes i think agar main bi hota toh at least marry to kar pata ( marry a girl i mean )...
hmm....I wrote a mess i  guess...but samajh lena adjust karke :D... Now, dear Admin &lt;3  shed some lights on this... </p>
<h1>GCI- For some, sexuality is a spectrum. People can shift in it because God works in mysterious ways. But for some it is rigid. Bi's are bi's throughout their life and gays are gays. See, if you can't love vagina, you will never love it even if you take 2 much gold capsule no matter how many times. So, it depends upon you.</h1>
