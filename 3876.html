<p>...my story does not starts abpruptly, as it was already started somewhere. That's why I am starting with a continuation. As a kid I was enveloped in shyness...it always took me time to be friendly with them, and in some cases i never spoke with them for the second time. It's not that, like I was rude or something...however, even if I wanted to talk with them...I found with very hard. Today, I wonder this might be the reason, for my stay in a closet... Knowing that I am gay or bi...I can't confess, even to myself. It's pretty tough to be in this situation. Also that, its not only my audacious acceptance...but, it's about my parents...my family. I am not asking any suggestion...or sympathy....it's just that I felt like writing, and I did. And, I feel proud reading other's confession... Life needs motivation and bit of happiness, which I hope to share wid all of you... (My story unfolds the moment of being gay...and, take a courage to stand in a straight world... I'll post next time.).... Stay happy....stay gay! P.S. My blood is red as yours</p>
