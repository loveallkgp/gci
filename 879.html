<p>23 bangalore
Hello everyone please give me a comment from your heart i really need your opinions guys.
I am 23 gay from hyd working in bangalore. i came to bangalore 5 years back. for 5 years i search for real love but all i ended up was just one time sex. on the other hand i have a huge female fans in college and in office, i got 6 proposal from gals and 1 proposal from one of my colleague mom. what i am trying to tell is i am not that ugly i am average looking guy. but i dont know why all the gay guys who i met so far around 10 all of em rejected me. i even met guys who are not good looking by checking their profiles, like if they said looking for relationship then i met them, but always it was a -ve outcome. last december when i go for health check up i was tested HIV +ve, I didnt talk to anyone for a month,. then one day i was so bored i log in to my fake fb acct. a model guy so handsome chat with me and we just met up. i like him so much but i didnt had sex cos i was scared. we chat for a month and he went abroad for a shoot, Then i met another guy as a friend, Hevis very handsome too and we are of same age and we have similar taste. But he is a student, i just met him as a friend, but he is totally in love with me, we met everyweek for coffee and lunch , He started talking as me,. He copy my dressing,. and he started eating all the food that are my favourite. Last week i let him fuck me but i didnt fuck him cos i was scared, but i let him do with condom as the chances of spreading is less if he fucks me. He even ask me to marry him. but all i need is just a good friendship not love, just friend without sex, in the meantime the model guy came back from abroad he bought so many gift for me and ask me to move with him in canada so that we can. live together forever. Now i am very confused, should i tell em that i am HIV positive or should i just ignore em. They ve become so close to me i want to be friend them forever. i am scared to tell them and at same time dont want to loose them either as a friend</p>
<h1>Viv- You know, the best way to judge them is by telling them the truth that you are HIV+. The guy who will surely care for you will not pay any attention to it and he will be your greatest friend.</h1>
