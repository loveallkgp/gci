<p>I have Lost my Hope In Life. I JUST dnt Knw What the Fuck I Am.?
I am niether gay nor straight nor bisexual.!
I have devloped a kind of repulsion towards any kinda relation..
I m Broken frm within..
I was Raped At The Age Of 5 by my Uncle.. That pervert bastard. Destroyed my life. I hate anyone touchin me. I hate even when my parents touch me. I am jst 15 and I have destroyed my life by my own hands. I am no emotional stupid.. I m nt In Love With any and i think i vil never be. I hate people In Love. I hate People making love. No one cn ever understand. What i ve gone through that evening.. I cnt even raise my voice.. One day I am gonna kill him. And aftr dat i vil kill myself. This life no bettr than hell for me. </p>
<h1>GCI- I feel really sad for you. I am so sorry that you have to go through it. It's not easy to stand strong when you have so much on your plate. But remember, being angry at world and at yourself will do you no good. I was also angry at the world for a brief period of time and sometimes these days I do feel the same way. But that's no reason to feel bad about your own life. There is always a light at the end of a dark tunnel.</h1>
<p>Your anger comes from your childhood experience. You have to let go of that anger. Make something positive out of your experience. Otherwise your life will have no meaning and only you will be responsible for it. Trust me, I have been where you have been and I know how it feels. There is always a right path. Choose that one and don't give up on life.</p>
