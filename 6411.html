<p>Gaurav arora ...#spilisvilla 8 Contestant he is bisexual n he said he can dominate any guy he had rshp wid guys too in past .. n it is wrong news which i read in previous confession  dat no one is supporting him .. Ranvijay n mtv is supporting dats why he is in da straight pplz show .. # Mtv always supports lgbt .. n thodi bhot masti to chalti hain like emoticon</p>
<p>What is going on TV?
In splitsvilla8, two girls gave kiss to eachother in Villa, that Karishmaa &amp; Sharika. They have really guts.
But all celebrates, girls laughed on that. Even Sunny Leony, who gave lesbo kiss in RaginiMMS2 also laughed....
What is this??? Is this OK??</p>
<h1>GCI- These two confessions were about splitsvilla. I don't understand that why there is a discussion going on over here? I tried watching the show after all the fuss on the page, but honestly couldn't digest it. They all may have physical personality but they seriously lack manners, etiquettes, good attitude and have a lot of ridiculous ego. Seriously who fights like that on the premier episode? A big blah to it.</h1>
