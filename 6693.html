<p>sexulity is a spectrum like gender. there are not just bisexuals, there are homoflexible and heteroflexible people exists. flexibility is not exactly ur sexuality.flexibility is that u are not belong to that orientation but u want to do that sexual encounter for ur desire. such flexible people oftenly do it occasionally to fulfill their desire. but women are more flexible compare to men in this case. there is no such true male bisexuality but where there its exists,such males are often polygamic and the rest who u think are bi usually homosexual or homoflexible or heteroflexible. if u are androphilic(for boys orientation) then definately u are gay/androsexual, but if u are attracted to feminity and masculinity as well then u are bisexual. sexuality can be fluid for some people, e.g. at the age of 16 u are attracted to women but at the age of 35 u are attracted to men vise versa..thats a fluid sexuality. many people think when they stepped in their puberty they get to know their orientation which is false. u never know it can be fluid too.</p>
