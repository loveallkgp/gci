<p>today in evening I was going through my bike I saw a little boy was taunting on a boy who was looking girlish as I know already about him that he is a gay but that chaumin vala called him oye gandu and then he call a little boy and said just tell him gandu and told to him to him this chaumin vala want to fuck you 
I am bi top I felt very bad for that girlish boy his body and postures was like gay means his legs shape and walking style sorry I don't wanna hurt any1 but seems he look gay 
Conclusion is about the gay is that the society is not accepting gay people by law they admit or they accept the gays but their thinking is very poor gays are only just entertaining for society 
Want to tell you girlish boys please be safe and may be you should show some attitude and try to change the walking style</p>
<h1>GCIL- Hmmmm, walking style?! Like what?? Now feminine gays should walk like flamingos?</h1>
<p>P.S- Its Chowmein and honey nice of u to share a concerning message.</p>
