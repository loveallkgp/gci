<p>Hello buddies !! Though I am 22 yrs old, I am new to dis gay world. I dont know how to identify gays around me. I do have best friends but I think no one are gay :( I hardly feel tat I am deprived of Love in my life.I havent come out yet coz I dont have enough guts to face society at present. So I made my mind to open an account on FB so tat I can socialize with gay people and henceforth acquire Moral strength and courage so tat some or the other day I can openly say to dis world tat I am gay. As wished , I do joined FB ( obvious a fake account as many closet gays start with). I sent friend requests to many who are in my region and even got accepted :) I kept silent for few months without texting anyone coz I was afraid of dis virtual world (coz all gay profile status were wanting sex) . But one day I decided to start chatting with people so tat i can get suggestions for myself and make good gay friends. I texted few who were online tat day. I addressed them politely and told dem I need friendship and guidance. But shockingly, None turned out to me; Dey just asked me to send my pic. I said dem tat I still need tym to come out and so for time being I cant upload my photo. But dey slapped me virtually; Dey told me dey dont have time 4 friendship and asked me to stay away from dem if i dont send my photo. :( And I got d same reply by all people whom I texted :( My question is tat d people who ask me to show my pic in second txt itself, why cant dey upload der photo ?? If dey are so interested in faces den why have dey created fake profiles ?? Why people here are so mean?? Why gay people around here are so rude?? Why gay people wont help der own people?? Seeing all these I feel frustrated..No one here try to help people who are in darkness...I am done with dis Fb :( Shall I deactivate my account?? # dissapointed </p>
<h1>Viv- Uhh honey, those are the people who have a constant erection problem and will fuck anything or anyone that walks. To those guys, if someone isn't comfy while showing his pic why the hell do you have to go rude? After all if you look at yourselves, you are the biggest fattus here because you don't even have the guts to talk about your sexuality. Anyways confessor, you don't pay much attention to them. Those are the people who can't even put two and two together. There are people here who can be your good friends. There are groups and pages that will guide you with their posts. Stay the hell away from these people. It will be good for you.</h1>
